hm7ihbb,Annoying_Auditor,11/26/2021,1,Yes but I just want to make sure people know it doesnt pay for everything. That is not what I was told.
hm7pb22,Desperateforpizza,11/26/2021,1,How far back do they check statements? 1mo? 6mo? 1yr?
hm8lo2i,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,Then his parents company is technically committing tax fraud.
hm76jrv,lilmoonboi,11/26/2021,2,Completely fine if your credit score is still ok. Depending on if it’s a du or lp loan they will use 1% or .5% as estimated  monthly payment.
hm8154c,tripletaco,11/26/2021,1,American here. Haven’t written one in 10 years at least.
hm8inek,littlebuffkin,11/26/2021,1,As I said “if something goes wrong or 5 things as it often does there isn’t wiggle room”. I didn’t lay out my complete finances I just said the expenses relevant to OPs situation it doesn’t leave you wiggle room when 1) your pet needs a $3K surgery 2) you get mugged and have to replace your belongings and 3) you have emergency medical procedure with a $5K deductible and 4) both vehicles need new tires which is what happened in my case.   There’s a reason 30% is the high end of the standard because life happens. 40% doesn’t give you a lot of wiggle room. And we have no student loans owe on one car and had no credit card debt. Like I said I made it but I wouldn’t recommend it.  Also our original interest rate was about 4% if I remember right we did have to pay PMI as we put $20K down taxes are low in my area no HOA homeowners insurance isn’t high. So idk why it doesn’t add up for you but that’s what it was. My credit was in the high 700s my husbands was in the low 700s but only about 6 months old so that didn’t help.
hm7ho9v,addicuss,11/26/2021,1,Auto pay is weird. It sends a physical check in these instances and they can get lost. It debits your account first. Then months later the bank will automatically void the check and youll get your money back.
hm7t4yy,Rear_ended_old_car,11/26/2021,1,Yeah its probably worth between $2-3k. The only reason Im hesitant is because the taillight still isnt working with me changing the bulb and the fact that there may be some structural damage that Im not seeing. If it was just the cosmetics I wouldnt care.
hm8eyrd,peachykeen_xlh,11/26/2021,1,Ive heard of people taking lawyers with them when they sign thier enlistment contract. Either youll scare the absolute shit out of the recruiter or he wont even try and screw you. Things have changed a lot in the 12 years for me but it may be worth it. 4-6 years isnt that long but it is when you hate it.
hm7dhag,tobesteve,11/26/2021,1,Yes I now can see that an answer would be complicated and it really depends on why Im looking for it. And Im looking for it at least for two reasons one is to compare how Im doing relative to an average person so I can compare when they say someone my age/income on average has this worth. Yet another reason is if I lose my job could I cash in retirement and still have anything left after paying off those things and how much.
hm818w8,sir_richard_head,11/26/2021,1,No.  This person doesn’t know what they are talking about.  I assume they didn’t fully read your post and may have thought you were injured on the job.  Unless your injury was directly attributable to your employer or someone else’s actions no one else is liable for your loss of pay.
hm8lpne,RotaryEnginePhone,11/26/2021,1,Looks like youll need to make up for about $400 a month... definitely check out r/mintmobile right now. They have a 3 free months deal right now and if you could survive on their cheapest option that would be $135/yr for phone service. They also allow using the phone as a hotspot so depending on the service in your area it could replace the internet for basic needs.  Definitely take advantage of everything available to you. Food banks child tax credit. Find as many resources as possible before taking the second job. This is my opinion of course but I think this will help you be more likely to succeed with school. Ask your school for any resources available through student services.  Not sure of your kids ages but look into anything possible. Boys and Girls Club Head Start pre-k programs. See if your kids qualify for CHIP. ([https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/childrens-health-insurance-program/](https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/childrens-health-insurance-program/))   Best of luck! It sounds like if you get through this youll be unstoppable!
hm8s9rg,ZenGuruji,11/26/2021,1,The 50/30/20 rule is for people who find comfort in seeing balance.   The better approach to is to view your investments and long-term savings amounts as another bill and pay yourself off. Then use the remainder on yourself.
hm7m6gs,Econ0mist,11/26/2021,1,> If I understand it correctly choosing the target retirement index fund route would be putting all contributions towards that same fund?   Yes you would put 100% into that fund.  What brokerage did you open the Roth IRA at?

hm8iocw,cballowe,11/26/2021,1,I suspect if you phrase it that way you get answers that people would prefer to bounce Netflix so banks order it that way ... But the side effect is more transactions might bounce / have fees and if you instead say would you like to minimize the number of overdraft incidents you get a conflicting answer.
hm8guh6,Greenappleflavor,11/26/2021,1,Did your parents ask you to assess their current properties/situation?
hm8951a,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,So if my father gave me a $500000 house for $1 they wouldn’t be liable for paying a gift tax?
hm7tevq,Default87,11/26/2021,1,That is withholdings not tax liability. You aren’t being taxed $50k per year.   The first step to addressing your problem is to actually understand how taxes work in the first place.
hm8oxgi,PlasticDesk2021,11/26/2021,2,I’m not even going to read other comments before I reply. YOU have the upper hand. Used cars are selling more than new msrp. Tell your dealer to eat a duck then sell it for $10k more than you owe. Seriously.
hm8cbgt,Impossible-3006,11/26/2021,1,Maybe contact your financial institution. Who knows how many people this teller has tried this on.
hm8gyhg,Greenappleflavor,11/26/2021,1,1) absolutely if you have cash lying around. That’s basically the ability to grow money tax free.  2) doesn’t matter for now—backdoor roth is still applicable.
hm6s7aj,thaddeus_crane,11/26/2021,2,I would keep the dog if you can afford it (in both time and expense -- puppies are resource-intensive). I saw youre trying to coastFIRE -- it sounds like you have different values and approaches to finances and this debt would hinder you from your financial goals at best and drag you down at worst (especially if you get married). I wont comment too much on the relationship as its for another sub but 6 months in is *very* fast to move in together get a dog and then try to fix a mans expenses for him.
hm8eafo,DeathKringle,11/26/2021,1,Your idea of indisputable proof does not help you if the landlord never got it and the check was cashed fraudulently.   &#x200B  Otherwise you could claim your paying him and never doing it and having someone else cash it etc.      basically you sending it and having proof of a check being cashed is not actually proof of paying rent.      All it is is proof that someone cashed a check stated for rent and if its cashed and signed it wont state it went into an account just cash so you dont know who got it. }     So even in your case it LEGITIMATELY could be you did not pay or sent it to the wrong person or it was intercepted etc.      The only proof if payment is a RENT RECEIPT from the landlord with him CONFIRMING you paid.      Then it wont matter if he cashes your check or not you have a receipt showing you paid and that would be non disputable proof far better than just a check cashed image.      now if the check was not cashed but deposited it is able to count as indisputable proof that you SENT the money to him. But simply cashed? man..... anyone can easily do that... relatively easily anyways.
hm7viyk,wild_b_cat,11/26/2021,1,Wise is an international money service.  But if you want to learn more can you start by describing what it is you’re trying to do?
hm6sfbi,inkheart58,11/26/2021,3,I would personally avoid investing in crypto. It can have high returns but it is extremely volatile and is damaging the environment something your kids will see the effect of more than you. With that in mind there are many ESG funds popping up which I believe will see huge growth over the next 10 years given the pandemic and climate crisis. Id suggest looking at investing that $300pm into one of these or at least something more diverse than the 4-6 cryptos.  Also have you considered whether you need a car? If you do have you considered an electric vehicle and home charging infrastructure? This has an up-front cost but may significantly save on gas by the time your kids reach the intended ages for summer camp.
hm8pyxx,Sarkir,11/26/2021,2,Tellers/scammers cant really do much with account numbers except deposit money into accounts without raising any red flags. In other areas of the world account numbers are more widely shared since people cant really use them for much. Routing numbers are even generalized to states and regions. You would need a debit card and/or credit card to really do damage to someones account and usually people set up PINs on them to prevent unauthorized use. Bank tellers bankers and other bank staff do not have access to PINs or have a way to access them either. Usually the most they can do is change them with proper authorization from customers.  I would not worry about being ruined by this teller but I would definitely report their behavior. It is completely inacceptable behavior and huge breach in privacy and ethics.
hm8fr2i,Professional7Account,11/26/2021,1,In light of the new COVID variant is a commodity fund a good place to move money? Im thinking FFGCX because I have Fidelity. Any other suggestions welcomed.  For what its worth I have cash ready to buy I wouldnt be moving it from another fund (which the market is all down today - thus im not taking a loss).
hm80b9i,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,Got it!  Damn Im particular to the max but you guys have everything broken down so specifically. Definitely your engineer side. When those estimates no longer hold true dont take it personally--it happens to all of us. Especially once your introduce a home family etc.  In short those numbers look good. That definitely explains it!
hm874hy,Rubb-a-dub,11/26/2021,1,Been there done that!  1.5% is a super cheap loan by comparison US Govt I-bonds are presently at a tad over 7%.  Personally Id take the loan invest in something comparable and if you are feeling the itch to pay the loan off quickler pay more than the minimum every month helping shorten your term and paid interest. Make your money work for you!
hm84osg,jorge1209,11/26/2021,1,If you are not a US citizen or permanent resident you should be careful with tax advantaged accounts. If you return to Europe the tax benefits may not apply the same way.
hm8kgzn,LooksAtClouds,11/26/2021,3,I would doublecheck that pension amount or look it up with him just to make absolutely sure.
hm8j1bi,trmoore87,11/26/2021,1,Got it. So I’m in a similar situation to OP. should I contribute $6k annually to my 401k after tax and do an annual rollover to a Roth IRA? Would this effectively be the same as having a direct $6k contribution? And my wife could also do the same thing.   Also do 401k contributions reduce MAGI? Our annual base is around $225k. We are just on the edge of the cutoff.
hm6ujfm,SuckaPunchSpliff,11/26/2021,1,Student loans. I’ve been waiting for the forbearance to be over to pay them off. How much should I save for a down payment?
hm6xgyv,rallyally,11/26/2021,1,That’s what is so frustrating. I can’t get past HR to get info for these other contacts. Everything “goes through HR” is what they keep telling me.
hm6u1d9,failedcoup16,11/26/2021,1,His rent will probably cost more then his current mortgage if he moves to Florida lol
hm714uh,stillhavingissues,11/26/2021,1,The commenter below is correct.  KBB puts my car at 11k and tesla is giving me almost 14 to trade it in.   I saw a similar model same miles same year for sale on carvana for 17500.   This is a 6 year old car that I paid 23 for brand new.
hm8hy7i,brittyn,11/26/2021,1,They’ll have a 24/7 customer service number. You should call them now at the very least.
hm7idva,danger_close7,11/26/2021,1,I did too but I would say it is still a good financial option  because you graduate with a free degree that you’ll have for life and a relatively well paying and secure job for at least 4 years to pay off said loans. There are ways to be frugal such as being an RA in college for free housing and having a work-study job to minimize the loan amounts.
hm88wq7,tstill_,11/26/2021,1,well this is just factually wrong
hm75wj4,under_the_c,11/26/2021,1,No advantage to paying cash anymore. Just agree on financing make sure theres no early penalty then just pay the entire loan down.
hm73l1j,WantToRetireSomeday,11/26/2021,2,I like NewRetirement.com. It’s not fancy but does pretty much everything you are looking for. it’s $75/yr. It estimates taxes RMD’s inflation (adjustable) social security etc.   This will get downvoted as most here like personalcapital ynab or mint.
hm7fopr,DigitalDeath12,11/26/2021,1,I’d much rather a young service person would buy a crotch rocket over any sports car. They force you to go through their safety course in order to ride the motorcycle on base. When I was in the Navy they would have monthly rides scheduled where everyone on base would take a 3-4 hour ride together.
hm6uv9x,Ecstatic_Being8277,11/26/2021,1,Per KBB $20K in repairs would make almost all 2018 Rav4s a total loss since more than 50% of the cars value was declared as loss.  Here is the reference:   [https://www.kbb.com/cars-for-sale/used/2018/toyota/rav4/addison-tx-75001?distance=100](https://www.kbb.com/cars-for-sale/used/2018/toyota/rav4/addison-tx-75001?distance=100)  You need to go on [KBB.com](https://KBB.com) or [NADA.COM](https://NADA.COM) and establish your cars exact value based on the model mileage and where you live!  Print this information out.  Send it to the insurance company so you are compensated a true value!
hm8i4li,AldermanAl,11/26/2021,1,Real bank employee will never contact you via Facebook Messenger or any other social media app.
hm7v3qk,krone-icals,11/26/2021,1,Liable? For what? Ive never owed them loans debts anything. It was just a savings account I decided to end and they wouldnt give me my money back. No weird timing terms minimums nothing like that just a savings account.  Ive looked through their terms and as far as I can tell its 100% their problem but Im no lawyer and dont want to waste more time on it I just dont want them to think that that is ok!
hm7dxv4,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,While 3.5% isnt high it isnt low either.  Saying that your rate is already locked is a potential concern.  It may cost you money to back out of the loan at this point.  You should get quotes from two additional lenders.  Dont bother bringing up the construction discussion or you might end up with a construction loan.  What you want is a cash out refinance.
hm7d20t,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,FICO does not produce a score until you have your first credit account for 6 months. Even then it is still very thin file but should qualify you for some of the good enough unsecured cards.
hm77qro,AdditionalAttorney,11/26/2021,1,👍 go in assuming it was a weird administrative glitch.  Maybe the clock in/clock out didn’t register for one of your shifts
hm8jkej,Jeabers,11/26/2021,1,Makes it even worse. I would speak to the manager as well as call/tweet/email corporate customer service.
hm6xjes,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,She lives outside the US so cant really be collected on and sued. Hence no immediate reprocussions.  But if she returns to America she may have a financial/credit mess to deal with.
hm8fa9v,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,Insurance follows the car not the driver almost everywhere.  But insurance companies have rules about who needs to be listed as a driver in order to rate properly.  As a general rule of thumb most insurance companies will require that anyone who regularly operates the vehicle be listed on the policy.
hm8904u,shipwreck17,11/26/2021,1,No joke. Our first house didnt get curtains for a year because we couldnt agree on a fabric then had sticker shock.
hm6x5si,Gavilan_y_Paloma,11/26/2021,3,Thats what I thought as well. Thank you.
hm86g1r,CoeusDarksoul,11/26/2021,1,Thats not what you said. You said that Bill Pay removes the funds from the account. I have in fact closely examined all of Bill Pays packages they do not in fact all operate that way. Again please dont state fact when there are many more variables involved it gives the wrong impression and leaves people with misinformation.
hm85c05,WhamBar_,11/26/2021,1,Yeah my sympathies. Don’t beat yourself up you live and learn.
hm7ffvf,zBunnyslayerz,11/26/2021,1,Unless you want to be the guy that relies on their parents to pay their bills you should not invest anything in your 401k until you have a 3-6 months emergency fund. After that invest up to the match then invest the rest in an IRA.   I would not rely on your parents as a backup plan if things do not work out as that could damage the relationship and your parents could view you as taking advantage of them. My dad loves me a ton and has my back but if my lifestyle and financial decisions deem that I need to rely on him for money he will not be happy.
hm865es,SeriousMannequin,11/26/2021,1,I had to apply for a new credit card because I wanted a new hotel credit card.   Experian will actuary do like a one time access pin for whoever you are applying with to pull it for a short time.   Works for me as I had me and my family members’ credit frozen ever since the big hack.   No doubt they’re still updating in the background though not like we have any choice or say in this matter.
hm7miv3,tobesteve,11/26/2021,1,Penalty is ten percent the match is bigger than 10 percent penalty therefore makes sense to max out the match.  If Im wrong can you please let me know why Ive never had to withdraw yet thankfully?
hm78h44,metaverse-emperor,11/26/2021,3,This is definitely his rationale. His motivation is that he doesn’t want to have to financially support me (which is totally not a bad motivation for a parent of a 24 year old). I honestly think I’ll feel more stable in a few more months when I’m situated - I’m in a slightly new industry now it’s not like anything might drastically change because it’s going well but still getting my bearings on just the way things work so far.
hm8dlho,claytonsprinkles,11/26/2021,1,Chase does this. The check issued is considered guaranteed funds like a cashiers check.
hm872he,slayer1am,11/26/2021,1,Everything hinges on how taxes apply to you and whether you should even worry about tax deferred investments.  I dont mess with percentages in my personal budget I just keep a rough average of a certain amount in checking and once it goes above that I skim off into the investment account.
hm707d3,acidrain69,11/26/2021,2,You boss is telling you to budget for the max bonus? Ignore that. Budget for $70k.
hm7j7ss,Ok-Grapefruit-1072,11/26/2021,1,Definitely and sometimes it feels like youre the crazy one and they are normal which also affects your ability to socialize with other people as well. I have worked 2 jobs before for six months then the last 3 I worked 80 hours a week which was too much I burned out.
hm7ir8r,seridos,11/26/2021,1,Unfortunately I would think that the order of operations would be the renter would pay the late fees and then in turn go after the bank for said fees.
hm6ttt8,MinutePianist4350,11/26/2021,2,I will just say out of all the times I’m familiar with a 529 being used to save money for children on social security it only became an issue once because the parents divorced (not a survivor situation) and there was a dispute over how the money should be held. That’s the only time I’m familiar with SSA ever taking anything close to an “enforcement” action.   It probably won’t be a problem. Just know there’s a chance however remote that it could become one.
hm8kaeo,orangebot,11/26/2021,1,The OP is not buying at market value.
hm6yx8t,thehawkman22,11/26/2021,2,You are correct. It’s a common misconception that contractors have to pay for clearances. Companies do not have to pay to get people cleared.
hm7xqed,nashbar50,11/26/2021,1,If at all possible you should be contributing to both of these.  You can contribute a max of 19.5k to 401k per year but only $6k per year to a Roth plus once you you reach $140k modified adjusted gross income you will no longer be able to contribute directly to a ROTH IRA.
hm7izk8,tastygluecakes,11/26/2021,1,Take a step back first…  What does she want retirement to look like?  Working part time?  Beach in Florida?  Stay in the home she’s in?  What lifestyle?  How much spending.  Start by determining a target - use one of the many online calculators (better yet do 3-4 of them) to figure out how much she needs to save to get there.  If that isn’t feasible start figuring out where to compromise: lifestyle or age.    Then based on your timeline and goal you can determine the right risk/reward -> asset allocation
hm6zh2z,SchismSX,11/26/2021,0,I don’t think I would have a problem with that possibility
hm8t4bu,WafflingToast,11/26/2021,55,Its the rise of GoFundMe culture for everything.  Im continually amazed at what people crowd fund for even if there is no emergency.
hm8glis,orangebot,11/26/2021,1,There’s a specific exemption for selling then buying a house. There is no such exemption for cars.

hm78oh4,ahj3939,11/26/2021,2,You should get into a rehabilitation plan where you make a few income based payments and they are transferred back to student loan servicing. Since you ignored them for so long there will be nothing negative on your credit reports related to them.  https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/default/get-out  On your mortgage application it will ask you several questions such as outstanding debts such as student loans as well as are you currently delinquent or in default on a federal debt They can verify this though the Treasury Debt Management Services. If you get out of default through rehabilition program you can answer no to this question.
hm7s59m,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,1,If youre referring to the section under Liability of the Cardmember know that this section is referring to Primary listed names.  As in Cardmember is not the same as Authorized User which is addressed in the next section.  In the Cardmember section when the plural is used it is referring to actual primary persons who are listed on the account.  As in for example Joint Cardmembers.  This is when 2 people (or more) are listed as Primary account holders and share all responsibilities.  This setup is rather rare in the cardholder industry.  But it does exist.  This is different from one Primary Cardmember and one Authorized User.  The Authorized User section spends a great deal of time explaining that the AU is not the responsible party for charges rather the Primary is solely responsible.
hm78cpi,greem,11/26/2021,2,What did the judge say?
hm8hz9z,monkey6191,11/26/2021,1,That makes absolutely no sense to me as an Australian. Here cheques can cost money (wouldnt have a clue since I havent used one for years) but a direct transfer is free. With our new payment platform most direct transfers happen within minutes.
hm8fojr,Mad_Skyler,11/26/2021,1,Don’t overspend then?
hm7rxpt,vettewiz,11/26/2021,1,That’s withholding. Not taxes actually paid.
hm78qu9,Phoenix2683,11/26/2021,2,It sounds like Chase cant provide proof of what happened to it not the landlord. If you follow his post hes talking about Chase then says they.  It seems like Chase sends paper checks and its likely the check got lost or misplaced. Chase should have refunded the money if the check was never cashed.  Chase needs to confirm if the check was cashed or not if not the funds need to be returned to OP.
hm8il2z,QuitProfessional5437,11/26/2021,1,Well if you wanna help your parents you can start by watching YouTube channels on remodeling your home.  Maybe paint and change out fixtures and do landscaping
hm7s36t,Cruian,11/26/2021,1,>I think one of the months I had high utilization but the rest have been around or under 30%  If you arent about to apply for more credit in the next month or two you dont actually have to pay much (if any) attention to utilization: it has no memory in a score under the most commonly used scoring models. Typically only the last reported number from each account matters so you can generally manipulate it as desired in 5 weeks or less before an application.
hm8kuys,Immediate-Joke8605,11/26/2021,1,Surprisingly enough I’m CPA lol… but I just have no idea in terms of investments. Okay.. i will ask my friends and fam for brokers thanks! I might go for stable market.
hm7q0h5,Firm_Bit,11/26/2021,1,Yeah this is essentially what we figured would happen. Thanks. I appreciate someone else confirming it’s a viable path or at least something to look into.
hm85n9n,i_need_a_username201,11/26/2021,1,Oh dear god it was. It was supposed to be taxes. Thanks for not banning me and it has been changed.
hm8lg4m,JhihnX,11/26/2021,1,Sounds similar to me. You can’t scrape enough money to make payments when you get your next disbursement?
hm8048l,teefdoll,11/26/2021,1,Do you think it would be worth it? Especially since this is only for six weeks?

hm6ywm2,Hi5Kokonu,11/26/2021,-1,RoR is important here are they matching up to 6% what are the rates on your loan and yes you need to add more into savings for emergency - emergency fund needs to be established before anything else. Also some of 401ks arent worth the match for example mine currently is 2% my return annually is better if I max out early than maximize my employers match

hm7mohu,c8080,11/26/2021,1,Max out your 401k to $19500. Do an IRA for $6k.
hm794tj,intern_at_olympus,11/26/2021,2,I joined army at 22 (Infantry) and it interferes with my ability to freelance. It’s just my personal experience though. You return wired different and there are new doors it opens but also closes others too due to new commitments
hm8hgy4,ApatheticAbsurdist,11/26/2021,1,That site assumes No medical insurance. No dental/vision no long term disability no commuter plan deductions no FSA no HSA deductions.  It also depends on what you put on your W-2 in terms of allowances.  Also if youre weekly and at that salary youre more likely to be hourly. Confirm that your hours are in order. The first week may have been partial or if you didnt get paid time off for holiday youd be short on hours. Make sure your wages start at 1000 and then go line-by-line on your pay stub to see what is costing more than that calculator.
hm7g162,ricksebak,11/26/2021,1,>	I am definitely switching now.  Probably a good move. And while you’re making this change in your account settings you could increase your 403b contribution by 22% without your take home dropping at all if you wanted to since previously 22% of those dollars were being withheld for the tax man.
hm7i3b8,redman2532,11/26/2021,1,I used to work in banking for a large organization- specifically in online bill pay. For bill pay  some banks send a trust check which is debited from your account via ach then when cashed funds would be taken from the corporate trust account. On this your bank would need to investigate and provide a check number. If not cashed in x amount of days (normally 90) funds should get sent back to your account. Very similar to a cashiers check.   Others send a direct check which comes out of your account when the check is actually cashed. If the funds were never taken from your account then you had direct checks. This is the same as you writing a check and would have your account and routing number on the MICR line on bottom of check.    Sounds like either way landlord didnt cash check.   Your bank or bill pay team should be able to provide a check number whether trust or direct. If the funds cleared your account either way you can determine if someone else cashed it or just got misplaced.  Since u have a copy of check it would seem it was cashed. The bank can initiate a trace on check to see where funds were routed to.  Either way dont pay landlord again until you determine what happened

hm8ehpr,Bduken_2190,11/26/2021,1,Anyone who uses privileged information for their own gain doesn’t deserve to keep their job. Sounds like you’re a good person but not everyone is and if he’s bold enough to reach out to you he’ll definitely do it to someone else.
hm7ctib,OnlyPostSoUsersXray,11/26/2021,1,I will have to look into that. Thanks!
hm7pcfb,dontlooklikemuch,11/26/2021,1,its done this way because with a normal check your account number is printed on each check so if it gets lost your account can potentially be compromised.  Bill pay removes that possibility by having the bank send a check on your behalf
hm6v47a,Drill1,11/26/2021,4,It’s been ten years since she turned 18 and had an accountant doing my taxes back then.  I know that I was asked each year how much I spent on her and how much was saved.  After my daughter turned 18 I got a letter from SSA saying that I needed to repay any money saved plus interest.  I did spend the SS money on her and didn’t cash in the life insurance policies until she turned 18.  The policies collected interest for 5 years and went from $150k to $190k and the money was tax free.  That’s why I said check with a tax attorney the laws may have changed.
hm8liq1,Frosty-Homework,11/26/2021,2,I’ve never moved cross country and Denver is not cheap at all so it is probably smarter to just drive the car till it craps out just to have a larger safety net.
hm745pr,anythingexceptbertha,11/26/2021,93,Not true with Bill Pay. They remove the funds from the account.
hm832mm,borkthegee,11/26/2021,1,This isnt true at all you can wire money all day long in America just like the EU  The reality is that checks are free and nearly every other option is 1-3%
hm87r60,peacefulhectarez,11/26/2021,1,On one hand at the interest rates checking accounts tend to pay (0.05-0.1%) over the course of a few days thats not even a penny unless the check is pretty large so it still doesnt seem worth it.  On the other hand Ive seen Office Space.
hm8cxha,krustymeathead,11/26/2021,1,you file a claim with your insurance. then your insurance will sue their insurance (or sue them if they have no insurance). since you will be marked as not at fault it shouldnt make your insurance premiums go up.
hm87kmz,kbragg_usc,11/26/2021,1,Same strategy here.

hm6xg4a,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,To fall under the safe harbor you have to have 100% (110% of your prior year AGI was >=$150k) of your prior year tax liability withheld from your paychecks for the year. (not 90%) The 90% relates to your current year tax liability-- if you have at least 90% of your current years tax liability withheld from your paychecks you can also fall under the safe harbor.  In your case you will have to make sure to withhold at least enough to cover your tax liability from 2020-- to avoid the penalty.
hm7i5f6,zerogee616,11/26/2021,1,OP where are you and what is your situation where a $3700 monthly income (quick math from your wage and hours worked) turns into $2800 before rent? Thats either an insane tax bracket or theres more to the story.
hm8r7s1,DarSwanSwede,11/26/2021,5,Actually the reason we America s are in this quandary is simple. We established the first systems and it truly has not been updated but rather patched over since the very early days of ATMs 1976- to present. My FI that I worked at for 20+ years still to this day has an old UNIX terminal and it wasn’t till just a few years ago they left machines that were programmed with Cobal and Fortran so.. 😂 let that soak in this FI is measured in billions too . New countries like South Africa began their FI journey at a much later time like other countries at time when the internet was already established the tech was already invented so they jumped headlong into Dip cards and contactless skipping 40 years ahead and I’ve seen their systems very impressive and very futuristic. We will catch up we just have to get all the mom and pop gas stations stores businesses to all switch. It’s taken huge strides just to get this far.
hm7fuav,umrdyldo,11/26/2021,1,How will they feel about crypto money coming into your account at the end of this bull run?  Will be viewed as suspicious?
hm6va1e,analogpursuits,11/26/2021,10,This is the answer all true. I am an Air Force female veteran. Absolutely better in every way. Was in intelligence. Stationed overseas had a blast. Now the VA is paying for my degree work and pays me a stipend to do it. No regrets. Go for intelligence or cybersecurity. TONS of jobs when you get out.
hm89q0a,NuisanceTax,11/26/2021,1,I’m driving a 2011 Mustang with a salvage title. I spent about $400 redoing some body work the reseller had halfway pieced together but I knew that when I bought it. No problems at all.   Google the VIN and see if you can find pictures of the wrecked vehicle (before repairs have been made) or ask the seller for them. That will tell you a lot about what damage to expect. Avoid any vehicle on which the airbags have deployed as those are hard to get replaced correctly and that can be a safety risk. Certainly avoid anything flood damaged as those can become expensive money pits.   Banks won’t often lend money on salvage titles so you may either have to pay cash or get the lot to finance it. And don’t plan on getting anything much when you trade it. Just drive the wheels off and then scrap it - or sell it to someone else with cash who wants a good cheap car.

hm76be3,UXResearch2019,11/26/2021,1,That makes sense. If for some reason I switch back to a traditional 401k and then my income reduces again for some reason I could always switch back.
hm8evr7,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,>Yes your rates will likely go up if you do.  Adding drivers does not automatically make rates go up.  Generally speaking if there are more car than drivers adding a driver should only increase the rates if they are a higher risk driver than the ones already on the policy.  Since we dont know OP or their mothers age/driving records we can only assume.  But in general rates go down as you age so unless OPs mother has accidents/tickets then their rates should stay about the same or possibly go down some.  >You have to have collision coverage to get it  This totally depends on your insurance company but most will offer comprehensive without collision.
hm8qhc0,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,34,It’s already in motion.
hm7gqny,lost_in_life_34,11/26/2021,1,there is no way you can be held liable for any charges unless the bank provides proof that you agreed to do so and adding someone as an AU isnt it. you have to sign a form or provide data to the bank
hm8pi8s,Nagisan,11/26/2021,2,Not much considering the minimum is $25k - at that amount the $7/mo ($84/yr) is only 0.336%. Taken out of the 4% its still a solid 6.5x higher (at 3.664%) than most traditional HYSAs at 0.5%.    That said Id rather hold $25k in other places that average notably higher than 4% with much lower fees too...
hm88x97,Cruian,11/26/2021,1,>Seems better to average in by spending 100 every Monday rather than dropping 3000 in at once.  Most of the time as much as you can as soon as you can is best.  >Upon checking VTSAX is 235 and you said I have to buy a whole share so I guess buying one share a month and 3 VTIAX a month brings me to 400ish.  You dont buy mutual funds by the whole share you buy them as whatever dollar amount you wish (as long as it meets whatever minimums the brokerage has which for Vanguard are $3000 for initial purchase and $1 for purchases after that). You can buy fractional mutual fund shares by default.  ETFs (VTI VXUS VT) at Vanguard must be bought as whole shares.  >I wish I could just set it and forget it.  Mutual funds do offer auto investing though may require you to have bought into the fund initially before you can set that up.
hm7bm9t,PutinBoomedMe,11/26/2021,1,He has to be some penny pinching Fidelity guy who cant get over the mental hurdle that paying someone 1% to get a 2% outperformance is way better than paying almost nothing to get the average. The creator of Vanguard himself was very open about how he was against paying fees for investments not professional guidance. They did a study that showed a lifetime relationship with an advisor where you meet for an in depth review at least once a year and build a diversified inexpensive portfolio together leads to about a 3.5%/year return difference as opposed to being self directed
hm7m7iv,skinnedalmond,11/26/2021,1,Thanks so much! This is really helpful. I think a Roth IRA will be best for him but maybe some in a traditional IRA wouldn’t hurt too. If he goes the traditional IRA route how is the income tax on distribution calculated? Is it based on his income from SS and his pension?   I didn’t think about social security I will check that out.
hm7q02z,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,Yeah sounds like someone is being entitled when they just need to get any form of income to keep a house.
hm6svkc,Blazemeister,11/26/2021,1,Okay so msrp plus dealer fees are the best you should reasonably expect especially if you’re getting one off the lot. And really the maverick starts at around $21500 as there’s a $1500 destination fee regardless of how you get it. Expect $500-$1000 in dealer fees and then state fees and taxes.   As someone with a Maverick on order really look at the base XL and see if that’s what you want. It’s relatively bare bones. Plus the hybrid is maxed out as far as ordering so unless you find one on a lot you’ll need to order the ecoboost for an extra grand roughly. AWD is optional but if so that’s over $3000.   If you’re needing a vehicle today then best of luck.
hm737jk,unchinhairs,11/26/2021,1,Have you looked in any local housing groups? With rent being $2500 for presumably a 1 bedroom (your post doesnt specify) there have got to be plenty of students and young professionals who find less expensive housing by rooming together and are around your age. By looking in those groups you might find more flexible housing options than renting an entire apartment for yourself. Maybe youd like a furnished space so that you dont have to buy additional furniture. Maybe youd be cool with a small room thats really a den not a bedroom because you just need a place to sleep during the week. It may take some digging but a few days of searching is certainly worth saving thousands of dollars over the course of a year.  Similarly maybe you can rent your house. If youre coming back every weekend then obviously the tenant would need to be fine with that. But maybe you have a friend who is responsible and wouldnt mind your company.  Also I am assuming moving will not impact your job but if it does that is also something to consider.
hm7937u,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,Loyalty rate isnt really a think unless they have some program that says you get 0.15% discount if you keep checking with direct deposit or something like that. They should have the info on their website if not they probably dont have it. They really cant randomly give people discounts or else theyll be accused and sued for discrimination.
hm8pd7w,vulcanjedi2814,11/26/2021,3,When I got out of school I squatted with sister couple years in basement. Maxed out. Modestly aggressive and then tapered to nominal.  Few yrs ago got roommate gave me sweetheart deal and kinda saw marriage kids possibly coming. Maxed everything I could while I could.  I didn’t have agenda except that I knew I wouldn’t necessarily always have those opportunities to save as much so went extreme.   I don’t think my oldest account went insane or anything. I’m 43 mostly single income crap raises.  SINK til recently and then her money doesn’t move needle much Have two littles now but still contribute much as I can to the things with lower maxes / matches.   I think I could have definitely retired early if stayed single I think kinda subconsciously used as retirement insurance. Retiring early was never agenda but just saved in case I needed to or wanted to. Certainly could have de stressed work and downsized job til full retirement age  Right now with the kids and wife large age gap trying to survive thru HS and then be done. My boss thinks I could coast now and I said he’s crazy with wife age gap and two kids pre a kindergarten at 43  The longer in and you don’t mess with it and get in your own way the better.  You can always dial back. But can’t always save more when u want to.   I just hit $1M.
hm8am2g,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,I’d love a house tomorrow but the whole no employment thing makes that impossible. Perhaps a few years from now.   The VTSAX thing is a separate save thing from the whole wanting a house thing.

hm8e80b,KarnWild-Blood,11/26/2021,1,By any chance is the warranty American Home Shield?   If so be VERY wary if you use them. You have to contact them FIRST if you need to take advantage of their coverage and THEY pick the vendor... which means whoever lowballs the job cost. And they accept no responsibility for anything that goes wrong.  Maybe others have had good experiences with such things but I have not and would never advise paying for such a thing.

hm8pj5o,HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,11/26/2021,2,Look into the cash envelope method to help get your spending under control. Pay down any high interest debt. If you struggle with using a credit card too much then literally cut it in half.  Save 3-6 months of expenses and once you have that emergency fund saved up look into VTI and Target Date Funds and decide which you like more. I’d also recommend looking into ibonds.

hm7qorn,chopsui101,11/26/2021,1,I’d put it all into a S&P fund…..at this late stage the TD funds will be mostly bonds….which don’t pay much.  The difference won’t be enough to make sense a bond is paying like 3% and it tapers off as time goes by.  Even if the market does well she ends up with less than 110k.  Either she is going to have to heavily par back her life style keep working or her kids will have to subsidize/support her.  Dump it into the S&P she might get 7% and end up with 140k not a lot more but still better than what she would have.        IMO its so late in the game for her she needs to take some risk in order for it to make any financial difference.
hm8hqgm,Boobsiclese,11/26/2021,1,You MUST report that teller IMMEDIATELY. I would do it in writing as well as verbally.

Then you have a record of notifying them.  That person is FIRED. And if they arent Id go higher. They have access to everything you have on file with the bank. You and everyone else.

hm7pgma,principalNinterest,11/26/2021,1,Last year (summer 2020) I got a 2.5% 5-year and 2.7% 7-year fixed rate loans through MSs pledged asset line (they call it an LAL--[https://advisor.morganstanley.com/the-capitol-won-group/documents/field/c/ca/capitol-won-group/Lending\_LAL\_ClientBrochure.pdf](https://advisor.morganstanley.com/the-capitol-won-group/documents/field/c/ca/capitol-won-group/Lending_LAL_ClientBrochure.pdf)).  They let me pick anything from monthly amortizing payments to annual interest only payments and the rate and term wouldnt change.  I think these rates were offered as a special at the time but nonetheless gives an idea of whats possible.  My AUM with them isnt notably different than what you have.  I previously had a mortgage on my primary residence through them and while i didnt take advantage of it they also have an offering that allows you to pledge your portfolio in lieu of downpayment/PMI.  This is a little stale from earlier this year but does have a rate sheet that should provide some context for whats possible:  https://advisor.morganstanley.com/sandra.wang/documents/field/s/sa/sandra-wang/Portfolio%20Line.pdf

One of my first renters lost their job and couldnt pay rent right before Xmas and I ended up letting them stay for a couple months and let them get out of the lease without going after them for fees etc as long as they left the place in a state where someone else could move in right away.

Or 2) decide up front you want to stay in until you retire then you can go ahead and do whatever you want instead of whats marketable.   You need to score 99 on the asvab. You need to get it in your recruitment contract in writing that you will be assigned to the job you want. You need to hold them to that and be prepared to walk away if they try to take it away.  Without getting assigned specifically to the job you want the army is a bad deal and you should instead go to community college on Pell grants and Stafford loans and get a transfer degree.

They claim they can’t cancel it nor notify the sender. I handle customer support for a niche software program that handles orders for micro-businesses. Sometimes their customers miss all of the various areas their service provider’s email is listed on their invoice and incoming email sent through our system and instead somehow send it to our noreply email. Only Cash App had the sender’s contact info so I can notify the sender they need to cancel and resend to their provider. All the others don’t and their customer service can not help in anyway. There isn’t even enough info to match it up to the provider (our customer) so we can’t even notify them to identify and inform their customer.

hm7gwfv,Extreme-Insurance408,11/26/2021,1,Travel nurses can make anywhere from 2000-4000$ a week for 3 days a week. My wife quit her WFH job to go back to nursing with a travel company making in the higher end. She also looked into NP and the salary for new NP is nowhere close to 150k. Travel nursing in an emergency department or ICU would be your best bet if money is what you’re primarily after.

Except you can have a warm feeling that you didnt let this go without hurting the bank a little bit.   Next time. Ask ask again escalate and ask escalate and ask again. If you still havent won after those 4 attempts then go to the CFPB.  Because any further escalations will likely be thrown away because We already told the customer they suck nothing more we can do.  Edit: You should have went to the CFPB after about a month of frustration.
hm8pp44,Tamerecon,11/26/2021,-19,Was it PNC BANK? Lol I had a female bank teller sending me friend request after i deposited some money on my account in july ! I would always ask if i could take lollipops for my children and she would tell me how she loved lollipops too.  When I would go drop silver bars at the location safe she will always wave at me! She got fired after i notified the branch ! She was going too far! Nonetheless I did accept her friend request
hm6ys63,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,Hey yep indeed:  My ideal plan would be to get back to work as soon as I can after my program and pay the debt down ASAP thereafter though Im aware Bank of America dont do deferrals.   By my statement I mean to say that my bad credit rating in the US doesnt have any bearing on my finances in Ireland so I technically still have a good credit rating here.   I have enough money to get myself through the degree but I dont have enough to spare to make even minimum payments. I want to pay back the bank but I literally cant at the moment.  Thanks for the link to the credit repair -- Im very conscious of what Ive done to myself with regard my credit rating but I guess I chose to gamble on earning more year on year
hm89ti6,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,Lol this just shows how little you know. My father would be charged a gift tax for the value of the house. Now you’re claiming I’ll be taxed capital gains for anything over the $1 I paid. The same value is being taxed twice under your logic. That’s not how it works.

hm70067,PetraLoseIt,11/26/2021,2,Im glad to see that his pensioen will be 4480/month.   I think hell also have social security. Check that out on the official website how much thatll be: [here](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/calculators/)  If youd add those two up he might already be where he wants to be when retired.  However of course: saving up some more money is better!  Personally Id have him look into opening a Roth IRA or traditional IRA with Vanguard Fidelity or Charles Schwab and then have him invest in the target date index fund for the year 2030. Because the target date is not that far away they wont risk too much of his investments but he will have *some* stocks in there to also have a chance of growth. He might actually retire in 2027 or so but its still okay that the money is in a 2030 fund even when he is already retired.   If he choses the traditional IRA it means that hell pay less income tax now but will need to pay income tax on the distributions when hes retired. If he choses the Roth IRA it means that hell pay the normal amount of income tax now but of the aftertax money that he puts into the Roth IRA he wont have to pay taxes on the distributions (and also not on any gains made within the Roth IRA).  Either is good (and in fact he can also choose to open both types of accounts and put a bit of money in both) and so they each have their own tax advantages its more the question of which one he thinks will save him the most tax dollars over his life.
hm87dvz,MakeItHomemade,11/26/2021,1,Is 2k rent for 1 bedroom or 2?  I think if you have a designated office that will help you vs all the “amenities” you may or may not use.   Make sure you max our your Roth / IRA too.
hm8rrpr,Peemster99,11/26/2021,180,> Maybe because social media makes it so much easier to see?  Oh weird inappropriate stuff happened all of the time before social media but it seldom got told to anyone beyond friends families and coworkers.  This level of sketchiness and weirdness may not have happened in a bank though-- Im pretty sure low-level bank work was a lot further from low-level retail work back in the 90s and this is the kind of thing Id associate with low level retail.
hm7lmxl,Promattic,11/26/2021,1,Dunno of this will help but I work in item processing and when we get our bill pays we still have to key in the correct accounts manually  ask the bank to double check that everything was sent to the correct places. Your account may have been debited but to the wrong account. Happens alot due to human error and even more so now when half the people are working from home will large amounts of lag causing even more human error.

hm7k1vy,tastygluecakes,11/26/2021,1,401k is great for company matching.  IRA is great for flexible of fund choices (and low expenses).    As long as you are maxing out the company match then put the rest in your IRA.  If you max that out and want more retirement savings go back to the 401k
hm8dqh0,ThisIsAMonere,11/26/2021,1,Bruh.  Wikipedia even knows you’re 100% wrong.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gain  A capital gain is when you buy something for a low price and then sell it for a higher price.  If what you were saying is true what would you use to decide how much something is “worth?!?”  For example: I flip vintage furniture. I get this furniture from people who think it’s “worth” $20. I sell it to people who think it is “worth” $600.  I make absolutely no improvements to this furniture whatsoever. I often sell the pieces the same exact day I buy them.  Who is correct about the “worth?” Neither and it doesn’t matter to the tax people.  I made $580 on that furniture and that $580 is a “capital gain.” I have to pay taxes on it.   Where the hell are you getting this false info from??!?

I dont think you are wrong feeling the way that you do either. Idk. Id judge the situation based on the teller. If you sense bad intent/sharky behavior report it. Else freeze credit close all your accounts and go to a big bank like Chase...
hm74037,HighlandValley,11/26/2021,2,Any recommendations for high yield accounts? The highest rates Im seeing are 0.5%. Im currently earning 0.05% and obviously a 10-fold increase is better but with the balances Im working with its something like a $50/year difference. To me that doesnt feel like enough of a difference to put in the effort of having a separate bank but Im open to thoughts on that or institutions offering more than 0.5%.
hm75dy2,Varathien,11/26/2021,1,The consolidation loan makes sense as long as it reduces all the interest rates youre currently paying. (If you have a few cards with really low APRs do NOT pay those off with the loan.)   It probably doesnt make sense to build up a big savings account when you have 19% APR debt or even 11% APR debt. Focus on paying off the debt first THEN save and invest.
hm7kz43,SuggestionDistinct51,11/26/2021,1,Like I said if buying vehicles that dont depreciate doesnt make sense to you I recommended you think about it.

Im with most others -- contribute the full match youre getting an instant 50% return on your investment (and tax-advantaged!) you can get it out if you really need to and its likely not the difference if something happens anyway.

hm7bx87,Edraitheru14,11/26/2021,1,No a hardship withdrawal when you cant even survive a month on your savings isnt going to stop a lot of the bad things from happening to you.  Youre not going to significantly miss out on anything by abstaining from 2% of a match for a few months or a year while you build yourself a safety net.   Better to build and have that safety net NOW so you dont have to make expensive mistakes later to cover your ass if things go wrong.  I think the dad has the right idea here. Once hes got his emergency savings in order absolutely contribute max match ASAP.
hm84ezl,WindfallForever,11/26/2021,1,I appreciate the feedback! Im planning on opening a Traditional IRA and maxing that out in a few months  Ill look into life insurance too.

Well thats why you arent interested in saving less.  Any interest in traveling?  Thats a great use of funds imo.  Never gets easier to travel.  travel all you can at 29 (pandemic reasons to not travel excepted)
hm8fifj,WeSellStuffonAmazon,11/26/2021,1,Clever way around it is to sell it and not report it anywhere.   The taxman isn’t going to come after you for selling a car. The taxman may be curious why your parents took a tax write off to sell a car to a family member for well below market but that’s unlikely to be an issue either.   The correct way to do it is to report it as a short term or long term capital gain depending on how long you owned it for but I don’t think I personally would worry about it.
hm8dgzr,Xaros1984,11/26/2021,1,3k *after* rent and groceries? What are you spending so much on? I would try to save/invest like half of that at least then maybe you can both save and increase the %.

hm7x747,Tako-Jerome,11/26/2021,1,Mental health therapist here - I realize this is all highly contingent upon somebody being open to it but for what its worth hoarding is a form of obsessive compulsive disorder the gold standard of treatment for which is called exposure response prevention.    If she qualifies for Medicaid you may be able to help her find an intensive outpatient mental health program by calling 211 in your area. Make sure you specify that you want mental health IOP and not substance abuse IOP.  In general finding a clinician in case worker through a community mental health agency is going to be one of your strongest allies going forward because social workers at the hospital will not do extensive follow-up once she is discharged.

Also your credit score doesn’t mean that you are good with your finances. That’s a huge misconception. Banks want people that are pretty good but not perfect. They want their money back and don’t mind late fees- but they don’t want someone so bad that they will default.

hm7hz29,addicuss,11/26/2021,1,Its not necessarily given that the landlord is trying to screw him. Auto pay is very strange in these cases. The way Bank of America used to handle autopay to things like a landlord is they would cut a physical check but debit your account. The second to check went in the mail. I actually had a similar case of OP. Had rent on autopay every single month. My check would go out. My landlord would cash it. One day I randomly get a deposit into my account the same amount as my rent. I take a look and sure enough it was a 6-month-old rent check that the landlord never cashed. The landlord never bothered me about it or noticed it so I dont know if he received it and never cashed it or got lost in the mail. But as far as my bank account was concerned for 6 months I did not have that money or any trace of it. It wasnt pending or anything else was just gone as if the check was cashed.  This was years ago so it may be different now.
hm8cimb,KBVan21,11/26/2021,1,What the hell. That’s so ridiculously unprofessional.   I don’t know how you’re so calm. This person has all your financial info and is then using out of workplace social media to contact you and ask for money because they know said info. Call the bank ASAP.
hm8n3fi,Flakmaster92,11/26/2021,1,With a three million dollar investment into VTI he’s making $60k in -dividends- (~2%) regardless of what the actual stock prices do.   With a three million dollar investment he can safely pull out a total of 105000 - 120000 (3.5% - 4%) per year and still likely end the year with more money than he started with.  A 3.5% withdrawal rate is usually considered to be “infinite” in that over a long term barring a total economic collapse you can stay retired indefinitely and still be fine.   As far as you starting out investing… max out your 401k max out your IRA max out your HSA if you have one save as aggressively as you reasonably can even if it’s just throwing $50 into your investment account each month.   The above is assuming you’re debt free or only have a mortgage. If you’ve got debt then go over to /r/PersonalFinance ’s wiki and read the Prime Directive flow chart.
hm72bqq,Neon_Yoda_Lube,11/26/2021,1,I would keep it. Count it a blessing and capitalize off being mortgage free. Use the money saved to pay off debts.
hm8gik0,mideon2000,11/26/2021,1,Unless your insurance payments are ridiculous id keep both if you have no payments. You can always drop the insurance and leave the car in the driveway as a backup. If something happens to the other car you have a vehicle to use insread of having to purchase another one. A parked car needs no maintenance except starting the engine maybe once a week.    Put it this way you said you might get 3 to 4k for it. That is not even a year of payments on another vehicle if your primary vehicle shits the bed. Plus insurance on a newer and financed vehicle will be more.    Keep the car imo.
hm87l5y,Thegreatoz123,11/26/2021,1,Sounds like you really want to have a 100% rating for the post 911 GI Bill(chapter 33) when you get out. If you happen to have some college loans they may offer you loan repayment. Do not take it unless you plan to do a second enlistment. 3 years of your first enlistment will go to earning your loan repayment meaning only a year is credited to GI bill. I learned of this detail after having it written as an option on my contract. I didnt even use the loan repayment once I found out the details but the VA still used it to deny my GI Bill rating for over a year. I was almost homeless because of that mess. Also do your own research on every promise the recruited gives you. Mine said sure you can have both loan repayment and the GI bill. Technically true but with a giant catch.
hm7wbbl,QuietFridays,11/26/2021,1,I hope this doesnt end up being too long winded but heres what kinds of things might be worth considering.  Also I am not any sort of financial advisor so this is just my advice.  &#x200B  You mentioned that your parents would bail you out in case of emergency.  Thats awesome that you have that support but you never know what might happen and that support might not always be available.  I think your dad is hoping to help you set up yourself in a position to be self-sufficient which involves planning for an emergency (such as job loss).  &#x200B  In regards to setting up an emergency savings common advice is to save anywhere from 3-6 months depending on what feels comfortable to you.  Lets say based on your given expenses this amount is a round $10k.  &#x200B  How long would it take you to realistically grow your savings to 10k with your current contribution?  How long instead if you contributed the 6% to your 401k?  Given those timeframes how likely is it that you could actually lose your job?  &#x200B  Different sectors likely have different risks involved.  For instance a software developer might have more job security that some in retail.  We recently saw this with the pandemic and with more variants who knows what could happen.  &#x200B  If you can contribute 6% and still continue to grow your emergency fund that is likely a great choice if you have good job security but know that it comes at a slightly higher risk if you were to need that extra money.  As others have mentioned you might be able to withdraw money from the 401k (which could incur penalties Im definitely not an expert on those details) but I think youd probably agree that you want to avoid doing that if possible.  &#x200B  On the other hand saving more now will give you a good sense of security and could lower overall stress because you know you can get through large emergencies without too much trouble.  You would be giving yourself time to find another good job rather than stressing about what you will do to get rent money while finding another job.  You will however be giving up free money and extra time for that money to grow in the market.  &#x200B  Since you are young I would opt for saving up the emergency fund as fast as possible and then increasing your contribution to the 401k.  But if the difference in saving isnt really too different (say it takes you a few extra months) I dont think youd be wrong to increase the contribution to 6%.  &#x200B  The important thing is to be realistic about what your behavior will likely be.  Make the plan and stick with that plan for a few months.  Then review whether or not youve been sticking with the plan and adjust if you need to.
hm6wakd,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,Yup I put the program on my CC. Im a goon I know :(
hm7tasf,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,i am thankful to not have to go through the process but from what i remember you are correct. It is just my preference to not have to go through all that paperwork and have the money available when needed.
hm7kg9v,bludgeonedcurmudgeon,11/26/2021,5,>Chase can provide a statement on whether or not the check was cashed   Right. If they cannot do that then how are they even a bank? Like fuck get your shit together Chase
hm81nqj,dukeofwar149,11/26/2021,1,I personally would pay cash and be done with it yes the interest is low but unless you were putting that money to work somewhere and earning more then that then it doesnt really matter its still costing you money to borrow it.
hm7uoga,cballowe,11/26/2021,1,Are you getting quotes for the one on the lot right now or we can order one and you might have it in 3-6 months?  Are you comparing the same trim levels and options? What Ive seen lately is that if you want it now you take the one they have with whatever options its got.
hm71fyo,ToMorrowsEnd,11/26/2021,10,Bank is lying that they dont have a record of who cashed it.   They need to keep pushing to either get the money refunded to their account or they prove it was cashed with the front and back image.
hm7s4r8,pecklepuff,11/26/2021,1,For sure I get that. But justice is based on technicalities so…
hm8m2sq,thentangler,11/26/2021,1,You have to factor in that membership fee to the interest rate… definitely lesser than 4% then
hm6wn3k,rowrowrowurbutt,11/26/2021,1,Very good points thank you. Unfortunately she doesnt receive enough SSI to cover rent its just enough for monthly groceries really.
hm7ths6,ronald_mcdonald_4prz,11/26/2021,1,So you’re suggestion is to lose to house and lose the earnest money? Would be much better to buy the house and then take a mortgage out on it
hm73dkk,BodhiDMD,11/26/2021,3,Only other thing to weigh would be if your company has a vesting schedule. Example: you’re 20% vested after year one 100% vested after year 5 (get to keep X% of the bonus contributions). If you only plan on being at this job a couple years it could change the math.
hm6yojm,hippiekyle,11/26/2021,1,>with rising inflation ….  I mean if inflation is more than interest then why rush to pay it off? Holding money on the side instead of paying doesn’t make sense but investing probably makes sense. And prioritizing extra payments definitely doesn’t make sense when inflation is higher than your interest.
hm8gt05,Cruian,11/26/2021,1,The 4% is for $25000+. There are accounts available with rates up to 6% for low balances only (like the first $1000).  &#x200B  It looks like this place charges a $70 annual fee (or worse if done month to month). For people getting in now there is that one time $99 lifetime option but that option is only available until the end of the year.  &#x200B  I didnt follow it too closely but is Fair doing something different than that Robinhood savings attempt? I believe SIPC didnt like the Robinhood offering.
hm7z1lt,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,Yes. You can open as many bank accounts as you wish. Just ignore the Wells account
hm8kqhe,Alternative-Cloud682,11/26/2021,1,No I am not a career counselor.  I usually dont respond to posts.  I was just putting my two cents in for a fellow military member.
hm84ls1,ThighOfTheTiger,11/26/2021,1,If you want to consider take home numbers only subtract taxes and insurance premiums. The other stuff is your money. Thats why people usually talk about gross.
hm86bnd,Rear_ended_old_car,11/26/2021,1,Probably about 5 mph not more than 10 mph for sure. My car is a Toyota Camry 02.   The taillight housing isnt cracked. The taillight bulb isnt working not sure if I didnt put in the new one correctly or if the wiring got damaged somehow.   As for the bumper it looks like her license plate bolts left an imprint and a minor dent. Otherwise I didnt see anything significant (though this did happen in the evening I might see more damage come day time.)
hm8j9hg,Birdy_Cephon_Altera,11/26/2021,1,If not for yourself then for others.  Because if hes doing this to you 99% chance hes trying to squeeze other customers as well.  Or has already done so.

hm8is7l,cvvhip,11/26/2021,1,You’re missing out on free cash that to me is the mistake. You should be trying to max your 401k contribution every year that’s easier said than done maxing the match should be bare minimum.   All that being said what’s the rate on the loan after February? If it’s higher than the 3% match you’re better off (not taking into any consideration the benefits of investing) paying that down rather than putting it into you’re 401K. This is a general rule for life. Debt seems bad and scary it is not. Debt can be bad very very bad (high interest credit cards). It can also be great (low interest home loan). Later in life if you have extra cash should you repay your mortgage faster? To lay down debt? Maybe. If the interest rate of your mortgage is higher than the rate of return on an ETF than paying extra on your mortgage is actually costing you money. Better to take the extra cash and invest it.
hm6wpcp,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,2,No the name change wont qualify then.
hm7uzmk,redapoluza,11/26/2021,1,I really dont think i overpaid by much when i got it. My biggest mistake was taking a 6yr loan and it devaluating in price quicker than i was building equity.   I didnt know of the exsisting rust issues which is definetely my fault. But at the time of purchase it was only 7 years old and had 70k on it with tons of nice aftermarket  options. I had shopped around and it was the best option i found for a used truck near my town

hm8tfj7,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,The comprehensive/collision is a question of cost vs vehicle value.  If you have a 2021 luxury/sports car thats paid off you should definitely have max coverage.  If you have a 1987 Subaru it might be more beneficial to opt for liability only.  If you add a second driver your rates will go up.  Generally speaking you can add anyone to your policy.  Your vehicle will only be covered for comprehensive/collision regardless of who is driving it if you have those policies.  Liability insurance is for the operator and legally required by each person to drive on public roads.  Does your mother have insurance of her own?  If the answer is no then you know what should be done.  If the answer is yes then why not add your car to her policy and cancel yours saving $700+/year.  Its easy to make up a simple lease contract.  Sell the car to mom for $1/month for 2 years (or however long you will be gone) then transfer the title to her putting yourself as the lienholder.  Realistically you shouldnt be paying for liability on a vehicle you dont drive.  I often had both summer and winter vehicles and seasonal storage insurance was around $10/m for my second vehicle.  This is what you should be paying for.
hm7sna5,wycliffslim,11/26/2021,1,Well your quality of life will definitely go down if you run out of money at 85.
hm7kaul,martinluther3107,11/26/2021,1,Some banks take the money from your account into the bill pay vendors account immediately.  then once the check is negotiated the money will go from the pill pay account to the payees account.
hm772lt,vrtigo1,11/26/2021,1,When you say we get nowhere with HR what exactly does that mean?  I wouldnt hang up the phone until they could lay out next steps toward getting the issue resolved along with estimated timeframe for each of those steps.  And if they cant give you an answer or the timeframe isnt agreeable Id demand that someone write you a physical check.  Im pretty sure most every state has a department of labor that would handle issues like this.
hm6x3aw,colty31,11/26/2021,1,I imagine they will declare it totaled and give you a check for the current value of the car. Unfortunately since used car prices are insane right now that check you receive will probably not be enough money to go out and buy an equal replacement vehicle.
hm7gcek,Phillip_Jae_Fry,11/26/2021,1,No thats only if you were due a refund. In that case you have three years to file a return and claim it. If you actually owe taxes theres a late filing penalty for each month that its late in addition to the interest owed for each month the outstanding taxes were unpaid. If you have a good excuse for not filing you may be able to get that late filing fee waived (stuck in a third world country during the entire year due to Covid seems like itd work provided OP can back that up with proof).
hm7a1bw,Cesst,11/26/2021,0,does it make sense if you have a spouse?
hm848fp,billiarddaddy,11/26/2021,1,Check your state laws for [rent] checks uncashed he may not be entitled to that money anymore.  Edit: I expected downvotes.  > Personal Check and Check Writing  > A personal check is a document that orders the bank (in which you have an account) to pay out the sum specified on the check. It contains the drawer’s name their account number amount and the payee’s details. How long is a check valid? This type of check is valid for six months or 180 days after which you have to contact the bank and the drawer to extend the deadline.  [Source](https://www.checkissuing.com/blog/how-long-is-personal-check-good-for/)  This might be a legal question since each state probably has laws that govern whether or not hes entitled to that money after not cashing the check.
hm8sjd4,nails_for_breakfast,11/26/2021,1,If you have any interest in the field at all and dont have a reason to think you will fail a very rigorous background check Air Force IT/cyber security is probably the best bang for your buck for transferable skills and qualifications

hm7x5m6,ChumpChainge,11/26/2021,1,Get Stash and invest it. I’ve made 35% return in just over a year. Compounded over time it could really add up.
hm86xpc,UnPrecidential,11/26/2021,1,I have received two checks in one envelope too each from a different customer. I almost did not notice the second check and nearly through it away with the envelope it came in.
hm8826u,93195,11/26/2021,1,Value of a car with a salvage title is indeed about half of KBB so the price is right in line with where it should be.  The important thing is to have a qualified mechanic inspect it thoroughly.  If the mechanic agrees the repairs were done right and as long as it’s priced right go for it as long as you understand the risk.
hm873kd,matttheepitaph,11/26/2021,1,If after 90 days the check isnt cashed they return it to your accout. They did not return it to your account. Therefore he can take it up with the bank.
hm7dj9j,kmpdx,11/26/2021,1,Mistakes do happen like this. For example if for some reason a person needs to manually transcribe an account number and make a mistake on one digit that matches another account. This happened to me once.
hm7ahvl,OperaticIguana,11/26/2021,1,The NYC rule is annual gross / 40 - so youd qualify for ~2k in the city.  But I dont know how parking or NJ works.
hm8fi9s,SlowJamm,11/26/2021,1,Like I said OP going to have to chose to really hurt this guys life over this. Some mistakes you gotta learn from. Just seems harsh to me to get him fired but I see both sides.
hm7plvm,Firm_Bit,11/26/2021,1,Sweet thanks for the heads up
hm6wknk,TesticularTentacles,11/26/2021,2,This is the path.  State Labor Boards dint mess around and Federal Labor Laws (if youre in the US) will be used to make sure employers comply with all standards.  That includes paying you for work done.  Document every phone call and name times and dates and make your case.  The money will appear.  Best of luck!
hm6wry9,joey_subie,11/26/2021,1,Yes we are currently living in it.   And yes ive done my fair share of watching my homes value go up in a short amount of time in this market  makes me feel like I need to act fast. However my dilemma is figuring out the next step if we sell- where will we go?   Should I rent it out while we live somewhere else?  But due to our low income at the moment  I dont know how profitable that would be for all the work that goes into renting out / listing / etc.   Dont have great credit so it may not be the smoothest journey to just rent anywhere I please.
hm7dkzi,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,What is the interest rate on the loan? It doesnt seem to add up unless you have a really high interest rate.
hm6x4tn,noodle-face,11/26/2021,2,For stuff like Christmas spending I wouldnt worry. If anything theyll flag certain transactions and ask for you to provide an explanation.
hm7qnxt,93195,11/26/2021,1,Nope.  “I sure wish I didn’t have this much money in retirement.”  Said no retiree ever.
hm7nrb2,cross_mod,11/26/2021,2,I slightly suspect that the landlord got an envelope from Chase thought it was junk mail and chucked it.
hm7kzhz,InaMellophoneMood,11/26/2021,1,For how venerated the dude is in conservative circles hes a real piece of work that fucked over so many people
hm7ghfy,brettick,11/26/2021,1,3% of a 52k salary is only about $130/mo more deducted from your pay. Will that make such a big difference in how long it takes you to save up an EF?
hm6z40k,hopingtothrive,11/26/2021,1,You need to take your recovery seriously. Stay as long as you can and accept all the help offered.
hm8jma2,grimmowl,11/26/2021,1,so for me that would be a conflict right. On one hand the home value is good and an asset to consider capitalizing on ...the other hand is can u find a cheaper area to live (and house yourself) in. None of what im thinking about is factoring in personal life decisions.  worst case you are housed rent free which in itself is something
hm6yn4h,NeighborhoodNo3050,11/26/2021,1,Can you refinance at any point. Did you do it?
hm8anbz,Fishtale1,11/26/2021,1,Yeah this is just a guy that buys them from insurance company and fixes them then resells them. Pretty sure the airbags were deployed. But I have the cash so wont need any financing
hm70kb5,rnelsonee,11/26/2021,1,Im not retired yet but my plan is to sell and withdraw a few times a year. And Id keep an eye on taxes - like Id probably hold off on withdrawing 401k money that would put me in the 22% bracket if I can keep my spending below that on average.
hm8875s,chronicweeddealer3,11/26/2021,1,Today I need moeny
hm6y4bw,No-Garlic-1739,11/26/2021,1,Yup I understand why this happens from an operations perspective but its just wild that you can work for 4 weeks before getting paid. It just feels odd.
hm8ifwd,crypto_boner,11/26/2021,1,Nope. You can invest in any states plan.  We invested in Illinois Bright Start or whatever for years when we lived there and took advantage of the tax credit for IL. We moved to MA and opened a plan here. I keep the old one open or else I have to pay back the tax credits.  So we have IL and MA 529 plans and were getting tax credits for the MA plan now.  Our children are not bound to attend school in either of those states.
hm88yom,polar_nopposite,11/26/2021,1,Appraisers serve an entirely different purpose than determining what people pay for capital gains taxes.

hm7gnov,shadow1515,11/26/2021,1,I wish all my auto bill pays would work that way. Verizon sends a thank you email for my auto payment on the day it is scheduled but then doesnt actually take it out of my account for like 6 more days. Its fine since its always the same day so I am accounting for it but its still annoying it takes that long because I like to check all my boxes and as far as Im concerned a bill paid is not a box checked until the money is gone.

hm78v4v,Varathien,11/26/2021,1,The Citi Custom Cash gives you 5% cash back on your highest spending category.   Its a pretty good combo with the Chase Freedom Flex since you can use the Custom Cash for your highest category that the Freedom Flex isnt covering.   The Citi Double Cash is a good card to use for everything else that isnt one of the 5% categories.
hm8dm9k,Corgi2love,11/26/2021,1,Yeah we already put 25$ for college monthly and 40$ for things he wants like toys. But if we don’t use it that month it goes for college as well
hm7cidz,rallyally,11/26/2021,1,Yes this is true however I was able to see that a direct deposit was attempted on the first two week pay cycle so that’s the issue. Thank you though
hm86c3a,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,Thought that was for people with jobs? Because you have to use income to fund it. My money does not count as income. It’s not taxed.
hm7lod4,benj_frito,11/26/2021,1,Didnt know that thank you!
hm8lkvp,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,Ahh thats great then.  In your original statement you didnt mention that you already had the 55k for the house.  Interest rates will only go up from here and the recent upward trend hasnt really impacted prices due to inventory shortages.  If I was looking for a home I wouldnt wait too long.  Once you get ready to prequalify ask to see the numbers between 10% down and the smallest down you can use.  Compare to expected investment returns to the increased cost and see if the numbers work for you.  Even with PMI it was better for me to invest than put a larger down.
hm6ww7u,skinnedalmond,11/26/2021,2,He’s worked there since 1988 and if he retired in 2023 he’d get 4480 each month pretax. I think he makes 6200/month now.   We were a family of 8 and when we were growing up he didn’t make as much so it was stretched thin. We also have monetary obligations to family who lived abroad
hm85thu,ciaobella88,11/26/2021,1,Oopf Im an RN and this has happened to me at two of my jobs recently. I had to co tact payroll and both companies ended up issuing me a paper check. Such a hassle but yeah I had to be persistent.
hm72z0q,ahj3939,11/26/2021,3,Ask for her @ameriprise email address. Also may be against the companys social media policy doesnt hurt to take some screenshots and report it.
hm7k37v,reality_junkie_xo,11/26/2021,1,I always buy new for peace of mind that the car has been treated well. Financing is usually much better for new cars (my current car is at 0%) and for risk-averse people like me you can buy an extended warranty so you don’t have any unexpected repair bills for 7-8 years.
hm8dmp7,Independent-Self-854,11/26/2021,1,It’s messed up because loss on a car is not tax deductible.  But yes it is a capital gain.   However depending on your tax bracket you may not actually owe any taxes.  If you are single and you make less than 40k then the amount of capital gains that gets you to 40 is not taxed. Think about putting that money into a retirement account to reduce your taxable income.
hm6w8xm,Gavilan_y_Paloma,11/26/2021,1,We were clipped in the front drivers side and the axel seems shot. The front bumper is gone. Our hood is bent. The frame may even be bent as well.    I am definitely having a conversation with insurance. I really wanted to know if anyone had insight on how this will work. I dont want to be jipped and not have the ability to replace my vehicle.
hm75koq,ratptrl01,11/26/2021,1,Navy or Air Force they offer the best employment opportunities after serving. Anything in electronics intelligence if you can get on a sub and learn that shit... I went to school for engineering and they tried recruiting me to be an engineer on a sub. I was like holy shit I dont think so lol. But the pay was insane they obviously value those things greatly and I imagine if you got a job inside a submarine that it would be a pretty good opportunity. Navy and electronics and radar all that shit is vitally important on a ship. I had considered the Navy for that very reason. This was 10 years ago though. No telling if the game has changed now.
hm7rj0g,NelsonCatMan,11/26/2021,1,Fair market price isnt a set price it changes with the market.
hm7sv8d,reddituserfromDE,11/26/2021,1, If you truly want to serve in the military than go for it.   But dont do it for financial reasons.  Get some training in the trades. HVAC auto mechanic carpentry etc....  .    Mike Rowes organization gives out scholarships.   https://www.mikeroweworks.org/
hm8f1sh,Cejvo7,11/26/2021,1,Oh gotcha. So should I just keep putting into it every month?
hm7h86i,zerogee616,11/26/2021,1,I think its less about altruism and more him letting the guy go with a good reference in favor of someone who will (on paper) reliably be able to make rent every month is the lesser evil than not knowing if OP can make the rent and possibly having to forcibly evict a tenant for both parties. If I was a landlord Id replace him. Besides the UK housing market is tight enough OPs landlord should be able to find a replacement tenant pretty quick.
hm85vfd,Lone_Vagrant,11/26/2021,1,1.5k savings for 3k monthly expenditure?   Dude. Listen to your dad and build up your safety net first. Bare minimum is like 3 months worth. But I would recommend up to 6 months.   1.5k savings pretty much means you are living paycheck to paycheck. Because the moment you lose your pay or your pay gets delayed. You are fucked. Or if something come up and you need to cough out more than 1.5k well you wont be able too until your next paycheck.
hm786bm,inkheart58,11/26/2021,1,Anyone tried Pocketsmith?
hm7l7kl,hnw555,11/26/2021,1,Thats not true for autopay. The money is debited when the check is sent by the bank. If you write a check and mail it it doesnt come out until its cashed.

hm793pc,Slimysalaman,11/26/2021,1,Chase freedom unlimited is a great all around card and I was sent an offer that had 5% back on groceries for the first year. Amex Blue Cash everyday is also a strong contender if you havent looked into it. My Sapphire Preferred had an intro offer valued at $1600 so it essentially pays for itself for many years if you budget towards travel anyway.
hm745oz,LOTEZK,11/26/2021,5,Just swallow your pride and do it. You would change the course of your life significantly.

hm6vdrh,Buddy_Jare,11/26/2021,7,Yeah that definitely doesn’t sound right. Someone with a pension like that doesn’t live paycheque to paycheque while working or during retirement.
hm8f77j,brittyn,11/26/2021,1,Yikes. I’m not sure why you’re so hesitant to report this ASAP. Is it a major bank?
hm7eexv,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,13% is ludicrous as well as the 6% you may want to look into re-finance. Also what probably happened is that the majority of the money from your payments went to cover the interest rather than the principal (the amount you owe). Look at a detail view of the payments and you will be able to see the distribution.
hm87sle,kdfn,11/26/2021,1,Idk seems like a large amount of effort and risk for only 6k in profit each year. Do you expect the home to appreciate in value significantly based on long-term historical trends in the area? Having PMI paid for is obviously a huge perk although at these levels the cost isnt super high anyway.
hm84qb0,Skootchy,11/26/2021,1,Fortune 500 company. Im not going to say who they were but they were the largest corporation in their industry not even close in comparison.   It was total bullshit. It pissed me off more because I knew they could pay it and I definitely made some calls to the local district office....but I also wanted to keep my job.   It was also a very political company. They ended up being complete garbage to me and I left.
hm81hul,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,Gotcha we sure are! Thank you for clarifying. This is definitely the way to do it IMO.
hm857lt,ChristyM4ck,11/26/2021,1,IIRC the Pell grant does have a limit
hm739vd,achieve_my_goals,11/26/2021,5,You dont want to be a sell sword? What? Youre just giving it away?
hm74tv0,PapaKraken,11/26/2021,4,Chase or its bill pay surrogate should be able to trace the check that was sent and determine the deposit status.  The fact that you have gone thru 4 unwilling Chase employees is most annoying.   Your trump cards are to report the incident to the CFPB or to your states Attorney General.   They both will have oversite and move the issue to someone with authority.   Even the threat of this should get a bank manager motivated.  You want the image of the front and back of the check or an ACH number.
hm7397q,islangmemes,11/26/2021,2,Vroom offered me the most for my car by a good bit and I sold it to them. Super seamless transaction. Definitely check the price of your car out there first before selling to the dealer.
hm8redh,cricketsymphony,11/26/2021,1,Unfortunately no 401k so Ill be contributing after tax money.   Based on everyones feedback Ill definitely be setting up a Roth this year.
hm8o7zg,catdude142,11/26/2021,1,Dont call them.  Appear in person and ask to see the bank manager.
hm779rf,ocast03,11/26/2021,2,I think it is sound advice if you only have $1500 in savings but have $3000 per month in expenses.
hm7dj2u,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,Someone I know who makes $1-2 million still drives a Honda. Buy a vehicle to suit your needs not to show off.
hm7bgcn,kilzfillz,11/26/2021,1,Ok cool so I’m on the right track. Thank you
hm7dn8t,pr0t3us,11/26/2021,1,You should be fine. IIRC you get up to 3 years to file without penalty so you should be fine. They just likely have an estimation already done based on history of you dont usually owe there probably wont be any fees attached. Ive missed before and they just waived any fees when I called in.
hm6zakr,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,Yep exactly! Its crossed my mind that I could technically just turn my back on the debt but I dont want to do that partly because Im not out to steal money but mostly because I would like to return to the US. The US is more my home than Ireland the standard of living is so much higher and I can earn far more year on year (but will earn even more on the new career track than I would have as an office manager)
hm77gup,ihavequestions621,11/26/2021,1,thank youu
hm7hljo,NoMoLerking,11/26/2021,1,I’m not exactly sure how you get on the list but there are apartment communities that are only for the elderly and those with disabilities. My friends grandma lived in [this place](https://www.corcoranapts.com/communities/massachusetts/andover/andover-commons/) years ago. It’s definitely no-frills but clean and safe. Commuter rail across the street supermarket next door. You basically pay 1/4 (1/3?) of your income for a 1 bedroom apartment.
hm8cf2m,last-resort-4-a-gf,11/26/2021,1,Does the title say rebuilt ?   In Canada a salvaged car could be fixed and then get titled as rebuilt . Otherwise you cant get insurance
hm72s6n,technologite,11/26/2021,1,Thats absolutely unreal.  Ive had this happen to me a couple times.  One time I had an actual physical check within a couple hours.   The second time...  I had a pending deposit within an hour and it cleared overnight and a promise that any/all fees that I incur would be covered by the company.  Payroll checks are handled differently than all other checks.  Theres 0 excuses besides gross negligence why you wouldnt get paid from a legitimate corporation for 2 weeks.
hm798iw,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,24,Me? Id get my emergency fund in order with a quickness before maxing out retirement matching. As for student loans thats a math problem. % paid over time vs expected return made over time. (Note expected isnt a promise and investment carries risk of loss). Dad may equate loan debt with burden and risk. So if you decide differently than dad explain youre reasoning and then ask his feedback on your reasoning.   We old folk have lived through some weird financial times. It tends to instruct our choices.   On a personal note I judge the rhetoric to be a wee bit on the harsh side... things like stupid/dumb or who to believe. People can disagree on the value of something and it not be dumb or about right vs wrong or who to believe.  The truth is all investing is an educated guess as to predicting the future outcome of value. But only YOU can decide the value of peace of mind and what I call the value of the hassle.  Your dad and your friends can both be correctly describing your choices. But they are your choices. And in case you need it you have permission to not be perfect and maximize every penny every time. Make the best choices YOU can comfortably live with. Me? I had two choices risking not making as much as I could or risking not being able to keep and enjoy what I had and start over. Well starting over was and is way too much hassle for me. I enjoy predictable and calm in my world. So I made sure I had security first. 30 years later (yep Im old) we own our little business house and cars outright with zero debt. Its not fancy but its ours. And when life decided to life all over us we survived and were able to help our loved ones survive too. For me that was the right choice. For others? Not so much Im sure. Moral of my story? You choose what can and cant risk losing. Then go from there. If you can tolerate losing out on max profit youll find there are more choices than you can imagine. If you cant tolerate starting over from scratch  well then you have less choices too. The one thing Ill tell you not to risk certainly not over money is a good relationship with your dad. Thats priceless.
hm78izs,SeegsonSynthetics,11/26/2021,2,Seconding this.  More responsibilities but it’s a better quality of life than enlisted.
hm7xo91,expfarrer,11/26/2021,1,get the quarterly tax numbers from the town asap and see if you can pay those
hm75bjs,OperaticIguana,11/26/2021,2,Well you said **ever find** not reasonable.  You can complain to your benefits coordinator about the high expense ratios.  Im not aware of any downsides to in-service withdrawal.
hm6uhbi,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,2,> But my understanding is that currently I am trying to roll over my traditional 401k to a traditional IRA.  Read the links before you do this.  Pay attention to Screwup #5.
hm81qqv,nattyay,11/26/2021,1,This helps a ton thank you. Ive got full coverage over my car so should I call my insurance provider after the offender is apprehended in case they DO have insurance and were just drunk driving?
hm82aop,ajeebith,11/26/2021,1,You will have to transfer your policy to your current apartment or get a new policy. But doing either doesnt cover you for “something that happened in your apartment”. For all practical purposes you are currently uninsured. Period.
hm6vtff,rallyally,11/26/2021,1,Sadly there was only one person in the physical HR office who had no idea about anything. Short staffed + work at home = not a good HR at all (but especially to try to physically go there) 😕
hm85nph,Ok_Anteater_7446,11/26/2021,1,If you are feeling burnt out with no light at the end of the tunnel and you dont have any drastic changes that will make it more difficult I say go for it.  If the market is hot in your area and you think you can get more elsewhere you can always stay where you are until you find something better. It all depends on your level of burnout and how comfortable you are with waiting it out. I made a similar move to what youre considering and am happy I did it but Id gotten to a point where I wanted to call in sick every day. You may not feel the same if you still feel comfortable.
hm6w9zh,dudeson117,11/26/2021,1,Yes. My contract is for 3 years so Im considering I will
hm8tu0o,ejohnson33,11/26/2021,1,I’d use the cash to pay your debts then rent with a nice emergency fund in your back pocket. You’ll then learn how to budget and invest monthly for the down payment later on.
hm862wd,trekologer,11/26/2021,1,Or it wasnt cashed. Now the question is whether Chase actually sent the check it was sent but lost in the mail or the landlord received it but never cashed it.   Id be suspicious that the landlord was just noticing now a year later that they didnt receive the rent payment for a month. Maybe theyre just bad at record keeping but if theyre that bad that they didnt notice not getting a rent check a year later theyre just as likely to have received the check and lost it.
hm7hgzb,Lollc,11/26/2021,1,Since your dad has proven he knows whats going on with finance hes not dumb.  He sees you have interest bearing debt and dont even have enough savings to pay a months rent.  That is a bad place to be.  And Im sure he knows because hes seen how easy it is to acquire debt when you are just starting out.  There are many posts to this subreddit by people with high 5 figure debt and they all got the debt when they were first starting out.  Dad is also trying to protect himself.  He wants you to have a successful adult life without having to bail you out.  You have more time than he does to build savings.
hm83mrl,93195,11/26/2021,1,You report it all as 2021 income filed in 2022.
hm6xbg0,Bort_Bortson,11/26/2021,2,Cash is whatever portion you didnt buy back as a Roth which is what you are going to hold onto to pay the taxes associated with the conversion.  Ignoring all other income right 10% rate assumption for example only. 9000 in IRA sold 9000 to cash account or direct to you. 8100 of funds bought into ROTH. 900 kept in savings or cash account based on estimated tax burden. 900 sent to IRS to cover amount owed when filing taxes.  Yes it is taxable. Youll receive a form in a few months that you file with your tax returns saying you sold a 9k IRA and that 9k is considered taxible income.  Obviously depending on how everything else shakes out you may need more or less when your actual tax amount is figured out. Hopefully your refund will cancel out most or all of the conversion tax so you can decide to do something with whatever you kept on hand. Its not like sales tax thats calculated at the point of conversion if that makes sense.

hm6wsg4,colty31,11/26/2021,1,GAP is irrelevant here
hm772tw,jaraldoe,11/26/2021,6,To tack onto this comment (highly underrated btw coming from someone in the Air Force)   Don’t commit to just one branch “shop around” and see what each offers. Each have their own up’s and downs and it’s important to find those out from someone who ISN’T a recruiter. Rarely will a recruiter talk about the shitty stuff that you have to deal with in that branch. (For instance where I’m stationed we have every branch and Marines are treated the worst by a large margin with the strictest rules and worst punishments)  Also Guard/Reserve are also hidden gems. Seriously look into the guard/reserve everyone I work with (Air Force Pilots) wish we had done the guard gig.
hm8k9ia,FNSlick,11/26/2021,1,Report this to the bank manager. This is absolutely outside any kind of ethical boundaries the tellers and employees of a bank have. Fuck that teller and report this shit.  This is how people get followed home and robbed.
hm859tw,CaptainSeattle1965,11/26/2021,1,Why would with or without a down payment matter if the applicant has a charge off?
hm7su1a,DLSR_Travler,11/26/2021,1,How do you do it?
hm8l3r5,carolineecouture,11/26/2021,1,You might want to also consider that this is some kind of scam. This may not actually be the teller or even someone from the bank but someone pretending to be from the bank. In any case if its actually the teller or someone trying to scam you it needs to be reported to the bank immediately. I agree with the others in the thread that this needs to be taken seriously. If its the teller its a serious breach of professional behavior if its not and its a scam that is even more worrying. Good luck OP. I hope you and your money are OK.
hm7thiq,German_Not_German,11/26/2021,1,Built the e fund first. You can always switch your contribution amount to the 401k later.  Less than a months worth of expenses in reserve is scary.
hm78qr3,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,2,I feel like you may have the wrong impression. Im curious which bank this is but they can close your account at any time. Just because you filed a complaint doesnt mean its going to change anything.
hm8gvse,trmoore87,11/26/2021,1,Following to see responses. We are in a similar situation. My wife just graduated and just started her job so she will only be working 2 months this year. But we will be over the MFJ Roth IRA threshold next year so we would only be able to contribute this year.
hm83bie,elpierce6,11/26/2021,1,This was so great thanks for this from a random bystander.
hm8ako8,Morepaperplease,11/26/2021,1,I’m addicted!!  I can’t stop.  I’m there. It’s not a large gap if I don’t contribute but then I lose the free 4% from the Company.  In their mind they use that as pay leverage so why let them keep it.  I could dial back but it’s fun at this point.  Plus maxing out a 401k Roth and standard 401k contribution is a goal!    I am riding the wave at this point!
hm6uqtx,snny_all_year,11/26/2021,2,Yes it began mandatory for new Service Members in 2018 and those who were under 12 years at the time had a choice to opt-in.   Its an automatic 1% contribution and then the service member can gain an additional 4% in matching funds if they contribute 5%. They also added in a defined continuation pay (lump sum like a reenlistment bonus) to be paid out between 8-12 years as a retention incentive.    The downside is that the retirement multiplier goes from 2.5% for every year served to 2%. So if you retire at 20 years you only get 40% of your high 3 instead of 50%. OTOH many service members do not make it to 20 and fail to save properly in their early years because they had planned to do 20. This way they walk away with SOMETHING regardless of how long they served. I think its overall a good change.
hm8cbto,SwAeromotion,11/26/2021,1,This is where you report that teller to the local branch.
hm6xglj,skinnedalmond,11/26/2021,2,Thanks for your input!
hm7bvqj,fepaz0024,11/26/2021,1,This was what I thought as well. The rep who gave me that info DID check with a manager to ensure she was giving me accurate info so... one would hope it would be accurate. I did pull the T&Cs right now online. Unfortunately its called the IMPORTANT terms and conditions. Its only 7 pages and while it does say my mom would be responsible for my charges on a day to day basis it does not address death. Apparently the fully T&Cs are sent with the card so of course my mom would have thrown those out a few weeks ago. Im going to call up and get myself off this card. SMH  Im trying to NOT have access to credit (except a mortgage). If I dont have the money for it I dont buy it and I certainly dont want my mom buying things for me.
hm7r3mt,shadow_chance,11/26/2021,1,Thats whats being *withheld* from your paychecks. Which may or may not be your actual tax liability. Line 24 on your 1040 will show your actual federal income tax liability. If your income in 2020 was similar to this year (and you didnt have any other big changes) that will give you a reasonable idea of what you owe.
hm7ql81,wild_b_cat,11/26/2021,1,The problem is what you do with your money once you stop saving as much for retirement. If you start spending it your lifestyle will get more expensive and youll have that much harder a time getting by in retirement. Dont make overly optimistic assumptions about getting by on a thin budget then just because you think you can now.  And thats before you factor in 30 years of inflation.  The coast concept is perfectly legit but it usually implies making big lifestyle changes now like taking a low-paying job just to tide you over until retirement. Its not a matter of just shutting off the 401k deferrals at 35 and cashing in at 65.
hm6wums,Gavilan_y_Paloma,11/26/2021,1,Thank you for your help!
hm7qh41,93195,11/26/2021,1,Out of pocket.  Your savings account interest rate (<0.5%) probably isn’t substantially different than a deferred interest rate (0%).  For $1800 just pay it and be done with it.
hm8i7y5,Chinpokomaster05,11/26/2021,1,That lifestyle creep will be hard to deal with later on when youre back to a likely lower budget in retirement (as others mentioned).   I had coastFIRE in mind but thats so one can dramatically slow down saving for retirement and focus on paying off a house in a HCOL location.
hm7y2qz,MydogisaToelicker,11/26/2021,1,Yes.  While I cant say for sure for your situation with the temporary new benefits on next years taxes it has switched and is now usually more beneficial to get the tax credit.
hm7xu0b,nevermidit,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for the answer. But surely theres a cost of sending the letter the stamp? I guess its cheaper then wire fee?
hm82ycu,th3wheel,11/26/2021,1,No brainer here.  The opportunity to grow to be less exhausted and to have less stress is not to be trifled with.
hm8jcml,Jeabers,11/26/2021,1,He probably has access to all of them (I used to be a bank teller). I would report him to the branch manager and switch banks immediately. Extremely unprofessional.
hm76bwq,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,2,Happens all the time. Usually a spouse accidentally or purposely keeps using and paying on the card. Banks eventually figure it out and we close the account.  Banks have the ability to go after the living parties if they so choose.
hm7fggy,JellyDenizen,11/26/2021,1,Whats the interest rate on your mortgage?  If its 3% or something like that then spending extra money to pay down the mortgage probably wouldnt be as good as investing it.  Other than that just save for maintenance expenses and fix things sooner rather than later.
hm6t3g4,continue_improve,11/26/2021,1,I agree rebalancing this year is a good strategy given your higher future salary. In your situation you will end up paying 15% so I don’t think there’s much game you can play.   There’s a chart on optimal sequencing of investment here somewhere. I’m sure someone will be able to point you to it. But typically you first make sure you get full match from 401k then max out Roth IRA then max out 401k and then taxable brokerage.
hm7zgu2,Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo,11/26/2021,1,It depends on the loan type and your employment situation. Typically 60 days. 1099 or self employed borrowers will be longer. If you do not need assets to close it could be none.
hm870wi,Aleyla,11/26/2021,1,If OP has a down payment then they have money to pay the $1800.         If they don’t have a down payment then they are likely going to have other issues buying and / or affording a house. A house can have rather large and unexpected expenses. If OP can’t afford the $1800 to pay off this credit card then they sure aren’t going to be able to pay for an air conditioner if that goes out.   Paying for a house is very different than renting.
hm870ps,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,No it’s not. It’s based off how much the asset is worth.
hm8ncdt,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,You are correct.  I missed that part.  OP owes capital gains tax on $4950.  If they make less then about 40k though the tax rate will be 0% if they make more it will be more like 15%.
hm7cvbr,blakeeli12,11/26/2021,1,I would look at all branches. If you are looking for the most comfortable living situation I would go air force. They get paid for things other branches do not like getting a bonus because your barracks isn’t nice enough. I did five years in the navy as a corpsman and I never touched a ship so do not let the idea of being at sea deter you.   While it can suck at times you will mot only build the strongest friendships ever but the Post 911 GI bill is nice. Not only is the government covering my tuition to become a pilot but they also pay me a housing allowance of $1500 a month.   Conclusion- If you want to go to school cost free and have are looking for a bachelors or higher then I would look into all of the branches.
hm8afr9,naanplussed,11/26/2021,1,Your balance decreases? That’s a debit.
hm7hkpd,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,My personal rule is save first and pay later ( If I start to hit my savings for payments then I need to take a look at what I am spending and remediate it). These are my percentages... since I am not self employed I put 6% of my pretax salary to my employer since thats how much they match. 30% of my after tax salary goes to the Roth IRA (max amount) and the rest in investments. My personal emergency fund is 75% of what I make after tax. Whatever is left is put in a separate account as play money for any investment opportunities should arise (stocks properties etc...)
hm79fd4,Quack_Shot,11/26/2021,1,Just gotta ask your employer we won’t know here what happened they may have mixed your hours with someone else. Very easy for that to happen since it’s just data entry. Compare the hours on your paycheck for that pay period with your time card for that pay period.
hm6snbb,whatsmynamema,11/26/2021,1,running is my backbone if I didnt do that I couldnt do anything. that probably sounds crazy but its true its transformed my life really.   Maybe I should lessen the intensity of the workouts instead
hm7uzzm,OnlyOne_X_Chromosome,11/26/2021,1,You do not get those benefits in school anymore. Reagan ended that.   Not trying to pile on here but maybe avoid specifics if you arent sure. Because thats twice now you have said things that arent true or at least arent true anymore. So maybe instead of your original comment you could have just said check with an attorney I had an experience that is different from what everyone is reporting.   And instead of telling that guy he is probably right (when he is wrong those benefits dont exist anymore) maybe you could have just admitted that you were unsure. Saying to talk to an attorney at the beginning or end doesnt really excuse giving out bad info.   Again not trying to pile on you seemed like you were genuinely trying to help I am doing the same so I hope my comment is taken in the same fashion.
hm6sp0x,AlternativePhoto3799,11/26/2021,1,Who cares how or why he has the $750k? He didn’t ask people to jealously try to figure out how he saved it? He’s asking should he pay cash buying a house.  My individual vote is yes you should. I did very similar at approx 1/2 the amount in 2017… I later chose to refinance or as they put it cash out some of my equity (just over $50k) at 1.9% - I had mortgages when prime rate was above 10% so this was nice… for my individual albeit somewhat similar situation (single income etc..) fyi I own a small chain of stores & my salary/what I pay myself via payroll alongside my employees is $85k my net worth is higher than that- significantly higher so just because someone makes $80k a year in no way means they can’t save or have access to vastly more just like or similar to myself & my situation but it’s nobody’s business unless a valid need to know exists or I choose to disclose which I learned long ago definitely don’t ever do that lol  The answer to this question is completely dependent on so many unknown factors getting a proper answer is impossible because it is completely based on your individual situation what your future plans are I mean it’s endless there’s not enough information here to give you an accurate answer other than a general one which is you can never go wrong buying real estate if you’re going to hold onto it. So regardless history proves doing so and paying cash for a home is one of the safest investments you can make and the money will definitely grow and survive even market collapses etc. as long as you don’t have liens placed against it or are able to pay the taxes etc.
hm73usj,itpro71,11/26/2021,3,Retired at 59 I usually withdraw a month worth at a time.
hm71hzn,NELA_21,11/26/2021,2,What was the investment?
hm84p18,wickedkittylitter,11/26/2021,1,Youd have $2600 left each month for all other expenses.  Only you can determine whether $2600 is enough.  Youre being aggressive with your savings/investments.  You can always cut back on the ESPP a bit.
hm6xk13,1hotjava,11/26/2021,3,Read the FAQ on here lots of good investment advice. If you have questions after reading please ask away.   (I post this reply because we get this question multiple times a day FYI. Lots of reading on here)
hm7eyqv,x31b,11/26/2021,1,They ‘care’ in that a visible scratch will take some of the value off the car. Maybe $500. Maybe $1000 if the door has to be replaced. But they have a shop and can get the work done cheaper than you. Unless you know what you’re doing just sell it to them.  As others have pointed out it’s a great time to sell a car right now. Bad time to have to buy one.  Edit: but in case it’s not clear in this market that would not stop them from buying it. They can look at it and know what it will cost to fix. Unlike an engine running rough or a transmission problem. Those they don’t know until they get into it whether it’s a $200 repair or a $4000 one.
hm8h6k2,Cruian,11/26/2021,1,>So my question is does it make sense for me to open a Roth and contribute $6k this year?  Everything helps. Though Traditional might be better if you can get the full benefit from it.  >Or should I keep everything simple and open an IRA which I can keep contributing to until retirement?  Your work doesnt provide a 401K or other employer plan? If so your income is too high to get the full benefits from Traditional IRAs.
hm7foa4,sab3192,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for the heads up I think one of the months I had high utilization but the rest have been around or under 30%. Ill try to keep at least the next 2 months really low then.
hm8728f,QuitProfessional5437,11/26/2021,1,Just leave after you fill out your Fafsa. You can fill out out starting 1/1/22

hm7113l,finance_n_fitness,11/26/2021,2,You can get a second job or you can move or find a roommate if you have the space. You won’t be able to sustain living that way.
hm7kfqi,oledawgnew,11/26/2021,1,What is the opportunity cost of investing--in other words what would you be doing with the money if you werent investing it?  As long as youre meeting required expenses and living what you consider a comfortable financial lifestyle I see no problem with saving/investing the remaining. You can always cut back to meet goals as they arrive in the future but if I were in your shoes I would not cut back on investing just for the sake of cutting back.
hm6v7p9,iamjerky,11/26/2021,12,Legitimately add their income to the mom’s checking account through a trust so you can legitimately pay their expenses out of the ssi benefits. AND have mom direct deposit a similar amount to an account that can fund the 529s. My mother was the trustee for an account and they were able to effectively shield this kid’s money for 20 years and he was able to attend school with money leftover for a large down payment on his first house. I would hire a tax lawyer a cpa and a financial advisor who is paid by the hour ONLY.
hm8htzq,mannymoes2k,11/26/2021,1,I’m by no means an expert but I can tell you there’s some very good RE/Investing subs on Reddit.
hm7qzen,dps509,11/26/2021,1,That’s what I had thought in regards to the balance being transferred from the old bank/cc. I thought it was no difference in their eyes as receiving a payoff.   As for the latter I’m not sure. Certainly worth asking.
hm86ad8,sirzoop,11/26/2021,1,He bought it for $50 and sold it for $5000. He made $4500 in capital gains and has to pay taxes on it.
hm86m6g,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,Can you tell me why? Would you do 300 VTSAX and 100 VTIAX?   I think I can only do VTI unless I buy a whole share of VTSAX now that I think about it.
hm8chb3,money_mase19,11/26/2021,1,Yes it’s an option for school to pay a bit but idk if I can handle my current job AND school. So if I just pay and do school full time I can focus on just school

I recommend something in intelligence civil engineering or some sort of administrative job.
hm842gd,nattyay,11/26/2021,1,Thanks a ton all this advice has been teaching me a ton about this stuff I knew nothing about. Will be contacting them asap
hm71d5x,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,Thanks yep I guess I dont really have much of a choice. I feel like a goon for getting myself into this situation but it seemed like a good opportunity to get this degree under my belt and just deal with the financial mess later. Only time will tell whether I made a wise gamble or a silly mistake
hm7szed,eggbirdegg,11/26/2021,1,havent tried looking at non-hybrid
hm7aguv,rnelsonee,11/26/2021,1,Yup 1 exemption then. And generally youd want more withheld to account for un-withheld income: think interest dividends gambling winnings (below a certain amount) capital gains etc. So if you had $1000 in other ordinary income (capital gains tax is different thats at a lower rate) thats $42.50 in extra taxes. So youd put in $43/26 into that box.  That and other people just like ensuring they get a refund. Thinking its better to throw an extra $20 per paycheck to give them a $520 refund in case there is other income or they made a mistake with deductions or something.
hm8ljlp,lemmecheckit,11/26/2021,1,Just sell it they will never figure it out. The sales tax will be harder to get out of. In the old days youd sell it for cash and write a receipt for a smaller amount.

hm70p4w,rowrowrowurbutt,11/26/2021,2,This whole situation is a giant mess and Im doing the best I can to keep my sisters bills paid. Sis lived with mom so mom paid their rent which was all above board and reported to SS.  Now mom is gone but sis cant afford the rent. She doesnt have the faculties to navigate finding a new place. Shes also an incredibly difficult spiteful person which has caused us to become estranged. But out of duty to mom Im still trying to help her live independently in the same situation she had prior to moms death.  When we learned that the inheritance might affect her SSI Id asked her to simply disinherit the money so it could then go to me as secondary beneficiary and I could use it to pay her rent and bills just like mom was doing. Again which SS would know about. If she inherits the money and loses SSI she can afford to live on the inheritance for maybe a year given her medical bills and medication copays. Then since it was mom who helped her file for SSI in the first place shed probably refuse to file for herself and end up on the street.  Since she refuses to handle any of this even something as simple as calling the insurance company Im trying to find a way to do it. Ill take into consideration that its important to avoid fraudulent behaviors thank you for bringing it up.  If you have any advice for how to handle the situation better please share it. The whole thing has been exhausting and my brain is fried.
hm84vc2,BigBat6,11/26/2021,1,whats gmails advanced protection program?
hm7253f,SlyTrout,11/26/2021,12,Never trust a financial advisor who works for an insurance company. There are too many conflicts of interest. They are likely to recommend expensive complex and unnecessary insurance products so they can get a commission.
hm7tlov,Wonderful-Mission-93,11/26/2021,1,Dividens are not fixed and my example is just an example. Not sure why so many people down voted it. Because its oil? Check the morningstar history on this stock. The dividen has steadily gone up never down.

hm8n12q,Sajomir,11/26/2021,1,Something may happen in the future that prevents you from saving as much. Major bill taking in a family member sudden child (adopted or otherwise).  Nothing wrong with staying ahead of the game while you can.
hm8kn2s,thentangler,11/26/2021,1,I had the same issue… I felt queasy re-negotiating for a higher salary… however I had a very valid reason. In my case it was the housing in MA. I did my utmost to try to find housing that would not result in me losing money compared to what I was earning in my current job. But I really couldn’t.  I called the HR and told them that I tried my damdest to make the numbers work… and I gave the exact numbers in how much extra I would need for me to offset the increase in housing compared to where I am living… and to my surprise they agreed….  So as long as you go back to them with clear numbers and with an honest and valid reason for re-negotiating they might entertain you.   But like one of the posters on here said…. You should also be comfortable with them declining your request or walking away from it if they refuse.
hm84gkm,One-Kind-Word,11/26/2021,1,Thanks
hm8kzlw,firearmed,11/26/2021,1,As someone who lived in Europe for the last several years and recently moved back to the US. Yes US bad.   Paying *any* bill in the Netherlands takes 60 seconds. Scan a QR code open your bank app type in your pincode press accept. Paid instantly.  Same goes for transferring money to friends or family. Transactions post immediately and theres no question if the amount went through or not plus no middlemen like Venmo or Zelle to deal with no need to track which email address or phone number is attached to which account.  I went years without entering an account number on a payment because the entire country is on one unified modern system.
hm87vhs,International_Arm843,11/26/2021,1,idk how large ur portfolio is but you could always use your stocks as collateral for a loan to pay the downpayment which would also avoid a taxable event (selling stocks). most brokerages let you do it at 1.5-2.5 % interest rate
hm761tf,itreallybelikethat2,11/26/2021,2,You’re a military kid so you probably already know how to get into all that kinda stuff.   If you know that’s not what you want to do IMO I would see about how you can go to college for free first. Whether that’s in state or in Alabama or somewhere else try to go for free. Free means you won’t have debt try not to accrue any while you’re out there. But it is time for experience and learning college is a place you can find different things and interest and get your foot in all the odd little doors you’d like to. So I wouldn’t miss out on it unless absolutely necessary.    If that’s not what you want either or doesn’t work I’d say to pick a trade. They’re in short supply these days and you learn more there than  you can at most regular jobs in my opinion as it rings true for me.   A 21 almost 22 year old high school drop out working on getting his ged currently but am employed as a sub contractor. I do home construction and remodeling. I’m working at a company that’s fairly new operating less than 2 years and I’m learning a lot. Pay is $17 an hour in the southern US as a helper. I like it I’ve worked as a package handler for fedex too (hated it but I lost a whole lotta weight too so eh) I worked at a gas station managing night shifts 2 pizza places and a carwash and this is the hardest but most fulfilling job I’ve had. I feel like I’m learning life skills. You know I can scan the fuck out of a package but that’s only gonna get me so far at this job I’ve learned how to build a deck screen them in build walls frame houses etc. With enough time I can start my own company from what I’ve learned there.   And that’s just one trade. Honest truth is you have more paths available than you’d probably think right now I’ve been in the same spot and it’s a good and bad one to be in mentally at 19 in a way. Bad because you don’t want to feel like you’re coming to a dead end anywhere in life or that you’re stuck but good that you’ve realized you want something more this young at that. You just need to figure out what that more is and you have time for that. As much as I praised being a tradesman college is still my first option for you personally.   Good luck man.

hm7k649,Varathien,11/26/2021,1,15% into retirement accounts is a common recommendation so I dont think you need to dial it back.   If youre hoping to retire early it makes sense to invest as much as you can.
hm7crrz,togsincognito,11/26/2021,1,A lot of questions floating around - but:  Who made you use Chase Pay? Was this a Landlord requirement or did you offer?
hm7foyo,robertoblake2,11/26/2021,1,Its like 3.25% or something like that. I do have a warranty? How much should I set aside for maintenance? And if I can max out my SEP-IRA and still pay down the mortgage should I do that rather than investing in a non-tax advantaged account?     Thanks!
hm7mut6,shadow_chance,11/26/2021,1,23.5% towards retirement isnt really out of the question. Now if youre having trouble saving a down payment for a house or something then thats something you have to weigh. But unless you have substantial assets built up already dialing back isnt really what you should be doing.   You could be described as a HENRY. High Earner Not Rich Yet. Dialing back is going to make the latter part of that harder/take longer.
hm73k26,rowrowrowurbutt,11/26/2021,2,Thankfully another commenter posted some helpful resources. After reading through some of them I can see that her disinheriting the funds is also against federal regulations. Which is something that I didnt understand before because Im not familiar with SSI.  Resources also mention that the only real way to handle this situation legally is to set up a special needs trust which Ill check into next.
hm75ew9,vulcanjedi2814,11/26/2021,1,While the premise isn’t flawed Per se.  Your example is. I’m sure can’t find a balanced etf of diversified high yield dividends. Dividends aren’t fixed nor guaranteed.
hm7vjzd,CQME,11/26/2021,1,I bought a new SUV a couple months ago.  Someone totaled the car I was in while I was on vacation and I needed a car ASAP to get back home.  Had a rental for 7 days.  Within 2 days I found the vehicle I was looking for 300 miles away from my location.  They only had one and it was the color and model I was looking for.  It sold close to the low end of MSRP.  I used Sams Clubs auto buying service to find the vehicle.  I drove there test drove the vehicle and drove off the lot 2 hours later.  I just checked Sams Club just now for the same vehicle.  I can find vehicles that are about 5% more expensive nowhere near what youre experiencing.  Maybe try getting a Sams Club membership.
hm7vcqh,GreedyNovel,11/26/2021,1,>is like me telling you to just go and look up how to weld a 1 double bevel joint.  I honestly dont think there would be anything wrong with that either. Learning something new is rarely a bad thing and that goes for me too.  That said I repeat that learning how to build Excel spreadsheets is time well-spent. It isnt just about learning Excel its also about helping to understand how the math works. For life-changing decisions like this I respectfully suggest its worth taking the time to learn how.

hm88nb0,delayedlaw,11/26/2021,1,Trade school or union. Learn while you earn. You can probably find something adjacent to what youre studying in college.
hm76jkp,Bicworm,11/26/2021,1,I would argue that an 18 year old in their first ten years employed will likely have pretty low marginal tax rates. Its definitely an option but keeping it as is gives them the ability to make that choice when they are a legal adult. Also one parent or another is going to end up footing the tax bill of their minor child. That ten year old cant file by themselves.
hm7bo20,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,Oh. Seems times are changing. Ill keep an eye out for this at my bank.

hm8b01f,money_mase19,11/26/2021,1,Yes but school plus Ed rn is just insane
hm7itiy,Soontaru,11/26/2021,1,Sounds like you’re checking all the boxes in terms of what folks recommend on this sub. You didn’t mention much about your situation or expenses but I think the questions you need to ask yourself are: Are you still able to make ends meet at this savings rate? Are you grinding too hard at work to sustain it? How is your family’s outlook? How is your mental health?  If you don’t like the answers to some of these questions it’s okay to dial it back some. I’d defer to others as to where you could cut back but the bottom line is you gotta make it to the future intact in order to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Sounds like you’ve picked up some good habits and built a great foundation but it’s important to find a balance between sacrificing for later and enjoying the now.
hm7erhp,numbhallow,11/26/2021,1,Definitely update the thread on the final offer its always fun to have a happy ending to these types of stories.

hm82e60,t-poke,11/26/2021,1,If you want your car fixed or replaced call your insurance right now. The longer you wait the more suspicious it’s going to look.  They deal with your exact situation a thousand times a day. They will guide you through the process. That’s their job.
hm8hh3e,wutzeeheck,11/26/2021,1,Youre misunderstanding what it means by value. For capital gains tax on property the value is defined as what the parties involved agree on.  Not its professionally appraised value. Since the two parties involved agreed on $50 that sets the starting value to $50.
hm83opl,raduque,11/26/2021,1,So this is slightly inaccurate. The AU benefits from only the specific card added to their credit file. They get the card reported as if it was their own card the balance is shared between both cards and both users credit reports.   However if the main user of the credit card has bad things on their credit report it will not affect the AUs credit report or score unless the main user turns the AU credit card into a negative account.
hm8fq0v,93195,11/26/2021,1,Nah mobile homes depreciate.  They are titled like cars.  You typically don’t own the land it sits on either at least if it’s in a mobile home park.  That said it’s a place to live.  If you buy a used mobile home it can be considerably cheaper than apartment rent so it’s not necessarily a dumb purchase.  But an appreciating asset it’s not.

hm745wt,lightnglass,11/26/2021,1,Thank you for breaking this down the way you did - it makes complete sense now.  Luckily I have only done the Roth contributions for a couple years so I am not totally mad at myself for doing that but I am definitely switching now.
hm8l0ai,orangebot,11/26/2021,1,A gift from the parents’ business to the child? I’m sorry but no. If it was coming from the parents directly then yes but as the OP states it is coming from the business IE it is not a gift IE there is capital gains tax.
hm8d14o,Buttigieg2032,11/26/2021,1,Maybe wait a year or two until you get more used to things?  The program isn’t actually $90k. It’s $90k plus all your lost wages for 14 months…so it’s actually around $180k to go to this program.  I’d really try to find a situation in which you could do this part time. Is there an easier unit you can do (e.g. out patient).?  Also are you sure NP is $150k? Seems high unless you’re in California.
hm7cm4q,0000GKP,11/26/2021,1,% is pretty meaningless. Save as much as you can or set an achievable $ amount as a goal. Once you reach that goal set a new goal.
hm8n6vw,thekidwonder93,11/26/2021,1,Ill get downvoted for this Im sure but I think if he were going to steal your money he wouldnt have asked.  He will probably get fired and be in a worse situation than hes already in and who knows wholl suffer from that outside of just himself.  In the chance he does steal your money you would get it back from the bank - especially with the evidence you have of him asking you for it. I have had money stolen multiple times and been refunded for it - with not even 1% of the proof that you would have.  Im not excusing his behavior but do you feel its worth potentially destroying his life over? I personally dont think so - but to each their own.
hm7295u,meliaesc,11/26/2021,3,OP obviously cant afford that.
hm8rds0,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,2,A mobile home is not an investment under any circumstance and are nearly impossible to get loans on.    A manufactured home is permanently attached to a foundation built after 1976 and becomes real property.  A mobile home can be moved and converted into real property but it can be a convoluted and expensive process depending on where you live.
hm79sp9,mattbuford,11/26/2021,2,Some of my billpay receivers are electronic and some just get mailed physical checks.  For the ones that are physical checks I can pull up an image of the check.  On the back of the check I can see that the receiving company put their rubber stamp on the endorsement line.  I can also see the date it was posted (cashed/deposited by the receiver).  It even has the receivers bank routing number on it and another number which I assume is the depositors account number.  Maybe you saw the image of the check and didnt realize there is a button to view the back side too?  Im not in the banking industry but as far as I know the check images are not captured when the check is sent out.  They are captured when the check is deposited/cashed by the receiver.  If it wasnt deposited I wouldnt be able to see the images.  And thats why the image has the receivers signature/stamp on it.
hm79l8x,WryGrapes,11/26/2021,1,To add to the chorus - not all Bill Pay services do that.  Im unfamiliar with Chase though.
hm7oh1w,Razberry910,11/26/2021,1,I cant say the army specifically but the military in general can be good for a four year tour. Airforce always seemed to have the nice stuff. I was in the Coast Guard(counts as military and with space force we arent the bottom anymore! nevermind we are still the bottom)  anyway if you have any Coast Guard questions feel free to ask.

hm6tkx0,JSA2422,11/26/2021,1,Thats correct youll only pay the cc fee from the app. Youll only be getting 1 for 1 points so my suggestion is to only do it to meet whatever sign on bonus youre eligible for (i.e. spend 5k for 100k points in 3 months)
hm8jt9o,Allysgrandma,11/26/2021,1,OMG We have a shit load of money in a major US Bank because I just sold my recently deceased mothers home and have just sold ours and will have about a million reasons to change banks if you get my drift when the money comes in from the sale of our home.  Eeeek!
hm8awz2,ruat_caelum,11/26/2021,1,Also you should join a credit union. You can join PenFed from anywhere in the US even if you arent a service member by donating like $15 to a military charity (check the web page for details.)  There are a lot of issues with banks but basically it boils down to this.  * A banks profits are paid to share holders. (The account holders in the bank are not customers they are the profit generating mechanism. e.g. fees etc) A credit unions profits are paid to the credit unions members. You are the cow being milked at a credit union you are a joint owner/shareholder/etc.
hm848zs,CQME,11/26/2021,1,> it sounds like theyre not very eager to confront the position theyve put themselves in.  Yeah I dont blame them.  It sounds like they have good family around them times like this the people around you tend to be the only thing that matters.  >This I dont recall. I do know that the number of boomers who pulled all or a large percentage of their funds out of the market was exceedingly high based on reports years later. Smart investors may have known better but it certainly set the stage for those in their 60s and 70s now.  Yeah guys like [Roubini](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/dr-doom-has-some-good-news/307553/) and [Grantham](https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/reinvesting-when-terrified/) the legendaries of the bears called the trough in 2009.  Right now[ Grantham is calling a triple bubble in housing stocks and bonds](https://www.fa-mag.com/news/grantham-sees-a-bubble-trifecta-bonds--stocks-and-housing-61425.html) and believes whatever is coming is going to rival the Great Depression.

hm6xm44,DSEEE,11/26/2021,2,In the UK.  A mortgage advisor once told me of a very solvent highly suitable client he had that was flat-refused a mortgage from multiple providers despite falling well inside affordability limits etc.  Turned out he had a LOT of frequent deposits to online gambling sites / bookmakers and apparently that flagged him as super high risk.
hm6tjgj,Do_Better_Today,11/26/2021,2,Lots of good advice here already. Here’s my advice as a retired airman with ~21 years active under my belt. And ironically it’s advice the military rarely follows:  Before you commit to anything make sure you define your exit strategy.  The military can be a great tool. It can give you good skills reasonable pay and benefits travel and educational opportunities. But surprisingly to some people a lot of that is optional and depends on you taking advantage of opportunities:  -	Did your research a good job and negotiate with the recruiter to ensure you could get it? -	Did you apply yourself to learn your job as quickly as possible and excel in it? -	Did you plan your exit so you have some savings and a plan for when you hit that four year mark?  I enjoyed my time in and it worked out well but I only planned on doing four years originally. I did not plan so at my four year point I just went “oh well guess I’ll sign up for four more since separating is terrifying”. Don’t do that.
hm7olu7,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,Even when your can get a loan less then the inflation rate? Sound like emotional advice more then PF.
hm85cng,DoomBuggE,11/26/2021,1,GoodRX is great as are the manufacturer discount programs that are available for certain medications (hit and miss in terms of availability.  However Costco also has an amazing discount program and it often beats GoodRX!
hm823ak,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,It doesn’t matter how much the previous owner sold it to you for. That will never be in the equation once you have to pay taxes on it.
hm78ekq,Romex80,11/26/2021,1,We did not possible mistake as we had gotten 2 auto loans through this credit union in the past and had paid both of them off early (by a few months). We were hoping for loyalty rate if that was a thing. Credit score is not an issue
hm8gu2u,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,Removing Overdraft Protection makes it harder for the bank to charge these fees per Regulation E.
hm8lvpb,Infamous_Turn60,11/26/2021,1,What does the stayement say?
hm7jr7w,aaaaij,11/26/2021,1,23.5% is good for sure. Personally I am save about 35% since my goal is to retire ASAP. Its up to you how to prioritize retiring early vs more working years resulting in more total lifetime income.
hm7f8t8,Famous_Speech5408,11/26/2021,1,Just a heads up you want to keep your credit utilization around or below 10% instead of just under 30%. I followed the under 30% rule when I got my first credit card (I stayed around 20-25% utilization) and my first credit score was  kinda low after the initial 6 month period.   Turns out the credit bureaus were dinging my score for high utilization each month but I had no way of knowing until after the 6 month period.
hm74a8d,micha8st,11/26/2021,1,Some people think that the Traditional is better -- better to take the tax break now.  Others think Tax Free later (Roth) is better.  A big part of that depends on the future -- it depends on Congress.  I hate depending on Congress.  In my opinion:  * if you need the tax deduction to maximize your contribution go Traditional. * If youre worried about RMDs go Roth.  To me the big difference between Traditional and Roth is that Roth IRAs are not subject to Required Minimum Distributions but everything else (including the Roth 401k) is.  Remember Congress is dumb.  Roll your Roth 401k to a Roth IRA?  Its now NOT subject to RMDs.  A few weeks ago I played with a couple online RMD calculators and determined that assuming my 401k doubles every 7 years (and thats the case if investments grow at 10% per year) then by the time Im 81 my RMD will be 4x my current salary.   but even then remember the Congress factor.  You do your best to predict the future but they keep rolling their dice in our lives.  How are you going to pay for CRNA school?  Seems to me you should cut back on investing to save for school.  Or will the job pay for school?
hm7vnft,rfieret,11/26/2021,1,Why the hell you guys still using checks? Just send it to each other’s bank account directly lol?
hm8loax,dequeued,11/26/2021,1,In addition to freezing your credit and complaining to both the banks corporate office as well as the branch manager:  1. I would strongly consider [changing banks](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions).  2. I would [file a complaint with the CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/).  3. I would also file a complaint with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency the FDIC or your state banking authority. Which one depends on how the bank is chartered. If you go to [this usa.gov page](https://www.usa.gov/complaints-lender) and click on Complaints about deposit accounts it explains and has links for each option.
hm6ym90,sznfpv,11/26/2021,4,Push it up to 6% 11 minutes after you read this.
hm7zj6f,teefdoll,11/26/2021,1,I checked and its a complete 50/50 I quality for some parts but not others. Its looking like I might have to quit my job. Im going to call in Monday to answer some questions or set up an appointment.  I didnt even think about this! Thank you
hm8bdf0,asks_mrtgg_questions,11/26/2021,1,Yeah thats kind of what I was fearing. As bad as I want to stay rent is getting to a point where its hard to justify and I think I may just have to accept the fact that Im getting priced out. Sucks but sometimes you have to face reality I guess. Thanks for sharing - I appreciate the insight.
hm86v0t,SgtSherman,11/26/2021,1,I used the GI Bill to live/party off of in college and also got student loans Im still paying off 15 years later.  Some of the most fun times I cant remember and very nearly did not graduate after being academically disenrolled twice.  Dont follow this advice.
hm83kx8,Aleyla,11/26/2021,1,? Thats not true.  Uninsured motorist is for the damage to your car when you are hit by someone without insurance.
hm6tenh,coy_and_vance,11/26/2021,2,Is your fathers first name Dave by any chance?
hm75hb7,heavy_metal_20,11/26/2021,2,The oldest email I use is first.last@ymail.com (mostly just a spam catcher now). Ive probably spent actual years explaining to people No I said Ymail with a Y not Gmail. Yes Y-Mail *not with a G*.
hm799v4,krone-icals,11/26/2021,1,Sure but it should not have taken them four months of driving me in circles to finally liquidate my funds to me. I would hope that a complaint is required to be responded to by them (as their terms say) otherwise they could do anything they want and we would never be able to respond
hm7jo1u,kichien,11/26/2021,1,You cant put a stop payment on a check that was cashed months ago if it was cashed.
hm8d3er,Teadrunkest,11/26/2021,1,US has Zelle.
hm82pyy,wickedkittylitter,11/26/2021,1,Youll be fine at $2k a month.  Normal advice is rent shouldnt be more than a third of your income.  You are well under that.  Add in no commuting costs and eating out (learn to cook if you dont know how) and youll still have plenty of funds each month.
hm7h2i0,SkyDog1972,11/26/2021,1,earlier this year  one of the months in 2020  The first sentence makes it as clear as mud how long after the payment should have been made that the landlord let OP know it was missing. It could be as little as one month up to about 20 months.  A little clarification from OP would be helpful.
hm7pgex,Desperateforpizza,11/26/2021,1,How far back do they usually look? 1mo? 6mo? 1yr?
hm6zdpa,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,1,That sounds correct as long as your insurance company isnt wanting to total the car. Im not sure about Texas laws/rules around that. Also Im pretty sure the value of the vehicle is the insurance companys top dollar theyll pay out.   So I guess the next question is how happy have you been with the car? Id say factor that into your decision making as well.   Im glad you werent hurt. That is the most important part of all of this.
hm8enqf,jimspokane,11/26/2021,1,Banks determine the order in which they post debit items to an account.  They usually post them in order of value with the largest debit posting first.
hm8obkc,OccasionAdditional39,11/26/2021,1,I assumed pay in cash and then cash out refi was the option being contemplated. Get the benefits of making a cash offer and then can take your time with the refi. I think interest rates are slightly higher than with a loan to purchase but I bet in this market that added cost is less than the benefit from making a cash offer.
hm8hw0u,Fe-Woman,11/26/2021,1,Move the money take a screen shot and tell the branch manager.
hm7170y,tbone-85,11/26/2021,2,Just open an account with Ally. It takes like 2 minutes and there are no fees and no limit on transfers
hm7u5gx,f0urtyfive,11/26/2021,1,(that part was the joke.)
hm7swkf,Sawgwa,11/26/2021,1,Does the debit for the payment show on your bank records?
hm6vxob,rallyally,11/26/2021,5,I was hoping this would be the case and unfortunately this morning I only got my second paycheck and still no sign of the first. (Although I’m happy for at least A paycheck lol)
hm88scu,irealycare,11/26/2021,1,Start the good habit now of investing regularly
hm8j8bj,LarryCraigSmeg,11/26/2021,1,No. The behavior is not some borderline grey area.  It is 100% inappropriate and the teller deserves to be fired.  OP should report what happened to the bank.  Do not respond to the teller.
hm8ftd1,ThrowHomeAwayM,11/26/2021,1,Where Im at the renters market is insane and probably only going to get worse. I got a good rate on my lease but its up in July and its looking like my rent vs a mortgage would be really close.
hm79kdk,PutinBoomedMe,11/26/2021,1,My dude you need to visit a CFP.    Letsmakeaplan.org     If it is a pension youre likely best rolling the funds into IRAs if theres no need for the money now. Unfortunately if dad passed after January 1st 2020 the kids essentially have a 10 year clock from the date of death to empty the accounts. With limited income and taxation you could try and take dustributions in 10 chunks as you approach the deadline. I doubt it very much any of these funds are Roth especially if it is a pension and was employer funded.      You could roll to the inherited IRA and still invest. Each year you could move shares to a brokerage account in-kind. The custodian for the money could withhold taxes but its likely that isnt an issue and you could just move straight up shares to the brokerage account from the inherited IRA. At the end of the 10 years you still invested and pulled the funds in a tax efficient manner. Unfortunately there arent any rules in place that allow you to convert an inherited IRA to an inherited Roth IRA. Even if these funds were Roth balances the kids would till have to empty the accounts by the 10th anniversary of the death. Again this is assuming dad died after January 1st of 2020
hm7qe8k,Double4Free,11/26/2021,1,I think lenders are hesitant to open HELOCs as they cant be sold to Fannie and Freddie and the bank will need to keep them on their books (housing bubble)
hm7nh6s,Impossible_Juice4321,11/26/2021,1,Completely agree!
hm6yi4x,Drill1,11/26/2021,3,She didn’t go to college.  She quit high school the day she got her first life insurance check and moved 700 miles away with her boyfriend.   You are probably right as long as you stay in school you can get benefits.    That’s why I said check with a tax attorney.   Everyone’s situation is a bit different.
hm78chk,blondie401,11/26/2021,1,Yeah makes sense! I think mortgage companies that sell servicing can do lower rates because they make up for some of that when they sell the rights to your loan. If all you care about is rate then definitely go by that!
hm7n0a6,veloharris,11/26/2021,1,Marketing can easily be mayhem having a competent team is worth it. That said not sure on the COL in your area but someone with previous coordinating experience is very valuable and can definitely fetch more than 50k.
hm8453k,WindfallForever,11/26/2021,1,My monthly takehome is $4600. If I were to spend $2000 that would total 46% of that. This doesnt take into account my total compensation though. You still think this is okay?

hm831qs,micmoor,11/26/2021,1,I went shopping today and now have answers to my questions. Most new cars are sold before they reach the dealership. Sticker price plus $6-8000 isn’t uncommon according to the salesman. Used cars are going for sticker price no negotiating because the supply is so tight.
hm84k0l,Sea_Database_7973,11/26/2021,1,Usually the buyer has to pay the sales tax when they register the vehicle. But depends On what state you live in I guess.
hm840ao,hopingtothrive,11/26/2021,1,In my state Uninsured Motorist Coverage is for property damage that you sustained by an uninsured drive or a hit and run accident. OP needs to contact their insurer and let them handle the claim.
hm7pgyj,dontsendmeyourcat,11/26/2021,1,Recently happened to my sister and she had to go into debt until the next pay date came around companies should be forced to sort this in 24 hours or be made to pay a fine to the employee it’s peoples lives they’re messing with
hm6yri6,wikiwombat,11/26/2021,1,Id be looking for another employer. You are an RN the demand is everywhere. If the first month of employment includes not getting paid.....yeah fuck that. Wonder if next time its not something that can be easily covered.
hm7lh4j,Aaaromp,11/26/2021,1,/r/creditcards  they have a template for recommendations also how did you build your credit to 800 with no credit cards?

hm8l7qg,VegasOldPerv,11/26/2021,1,Dont know anything about the company and obviously I dont know anything about this person who claims to be an advisor. But a quick search and I see these fees:  [https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/investing/ameriprise-financial-services-review-ria/](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/investing/ameriprise-financial-services-review-ria/)   > an **advisory fee that can go up to 2%** to cover the cost of designing and managing your portfolio. In some programs the investment advisor can also charge a **manager fee ranging from 0.10% to 0.80%** to handle more complicated strategies. You could also owe a **platform fee of up to 0.17%** to cover trading costs and the support structure. Finally in the SPS Advisor program the firm can charge a small **0.03% investments and infrastructure support fee.**  Ill pass.
hm7xg8h,human-potato_hybrid,11/26/2021,1,I mean if stuff is kept in his house I would think youd need a document establishing title to those items to show theyre not his.
hm8dbhz,Bduken_2190,11/26/2021,1,You have to start reporting your income. Even direct money lenders want to see prior year tax returns. I know business owners who file their taxes but write everything off and can’t get a loan because they show a net zero income.   Your can add her as an authorized user without giving her a card and it will help but she needs to be claiming her income as well.
hm8gykq,brittyn,11/26/2021,1,Better yet report to corporate.
hm8g9j4,sailor_sega_saturn,11/26/2021,1,If hes fired its all on him.  Misusing client information is like one of the biggest no-nos possible in that line of work. He definitely went through training that explicitly told him to not be an idiot. He decided to ignore that training and breach your and the banks trust.
hm8mnka,Lennonwhite42,11/26/2021,1,I don’t think so. As you said your young. You can never start saving for retirement too early but say something happens sooner than later it’s not bad to have some money in savings.
hm6ytfn,lilfunky1,11/26/2021,2,get a second job & work more hours & earn more income
hm8fywu,Featherfy,11/26/2021,1,Are you absolutely sure it is that same teller? Gonna play small devils advocate re: social engineering in case its a fake account of someone who learned about the teller and maybe knows youre banking with that institution.   But. Given the timing I doubt it and it sounds like its the actual teller.  Either way you need to tell the bank.
hm8ey37,pfinancelurker,11/26/2021,1,You sound like you want to diversify when VTI is likely your best option.
hm7nlfh,Reaperzeus,11/26/2021,1,They should check with whatever school theyre going to but a lot of schools also have a certain amount of credits that are test transfer credits (I think thats what theyre called something like that).  If the university takes those then they should look at taking CLEP/DANTES exams. They can knock out a lot of general education credits through them and theyre a lot faster than taking an actual course.  If they scored well enough to become a linguist by taking 5 CLEPs you can get an Associates degree in your language straight from the Defense Language Institute as long as you pass the course.
hm7r8ao,dejaVooAgain,11/26/2021,1,You are a better person than I
hm6uel6,PetraLoseIt,11/26/2021,7,When you want to pay off debts or want to free up more money to save you basically have two options:   1. Spend less 2. Earn more  Given how you already are working 45 hours per week Id lean towards you starting to spend less.   So I want to ask you: what is your current income like and what are you spending money on? Do you have an overview of what you spent in say the last month? Look at that overview and see whether its possible to start spending less - which would first free up money to pay off debt and later free up money to save to avoid going back into debt.   As for the debts: it can help to pay them off from highest interest rate to lowest. So you pay the required minimum amounts on all debts and then beyond that you put any extra money towards the debt with the highest interest rate.   You can learn to be better at understanding and handling money. Just as youve worked on your running skills and programming skills. It might help to learn some more about personal finance could be through books or youtube or podcasts...
hm6zw7d,YMarkY2,11/26/2021,1,Just curious how (and more importantly why) can someone have a life insurance policy without a named beneficiary? Makes no sense to me.
hm8ia8l,Rubily00,11/26/2021,1,Buying or selling stocks based on current events is not a path recommended by this sub. Since were more of a buy and hold for 10+ years type current events matter very little.

hm8beyo,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,Keep it in an account in your name that you know is designated as being for him.  /u/brawlrats is correct. You cant contribute to an IRA (Roth or Trad) for him if he doesnt have earned income.  Once he does have earned income you can start making contributions to a Roth for him using the money youve saved for him.
hm8i3nm,Martholomeow,11/26/2021,1,Pretty sad that to a bank teller your six months emergency fund looks like so much wealth. Seems unlikely that the teller is going to do anything illegal otherwise he wouldn’t have sent you the message. He’s just underpaid and desperate (and stupid.)  And now he’ll probably get fired for his stupidity and will be worse off than before.  Some people just aren’t cut out to function in this society. Very sad. But you really have no choice other than to report it to the branch manager.
hm7qi0q,RonJohn223,11/26/2021,1,That’s what I do.  Just unlock on the rare occasion when I need a credit check
hm6skg9,pelexus27,11/26/2021,1,If you decide to go with liability only insurance make sure that you can afford any issues that pop up like having your car totaled or stolen. No comprehensive and collision coverage means you’ll be in this same spot if you have another accident.  Please don’t ever get minimum liability requirements either some states only cover 10k in liability if you get the cheapest and with expensive cars like Tesla’s on the road now if you hit one you can and will get sued for the difference…
hm73ru4,throw-away-doh,11/26/2021,3,It sure sounds like free education and career opportunities until America gets into a real shooting war with somebody. We live in an unprecedented time of peace. The risk of death being in the military over the last few decades has been extremely low but sooner or later we will have another war like Vietnam or North Korea. Then you are just another body.
hm84nmq,grishno,11/26/2021,1,... and for that he is venerated. Trust me they know exactly what he did and they love it!
hm80g4h,NationalReturn8,11/26/2021,1,Yeah I requested that to them I had wanted a response before I actually sent it back to them. Sadly all I got was a “download the software” response and nothing else

hm87lk6,hjthrone,11/26/2021,1,This is helpful!!! I think the calculators I was using were 2021 and since weve never used the credit or the FSA before I hadnt really realized there was an adjustment for 2021.
hm78o7s,alex2000ish,11/26/2021,1,Ok I actually had this exact same issue with Chase. They eventually figured out that they sent the exact same check to my landlord twice.  Same check number and everything. The landlord deposited the first one it cleared then tried to deposit the second one which bounced because that same check number had already been deposited. I ended up having Chase send my landlord an official letter stating that they messed up and issued the same check twice which my landlord accepted and called the situation resolved.
hm830ry,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,Also I should clarify. It is NOT listed as a collection. It is listed as a charge off with a balance of $1801.
hm7jkco,CapeMOGuy,11/26/2021,1,Sorry for your loss. Lots of good advice in here.   I would like to add that most of us lose some decision making capacity for a time after a trauma. Try to avoid life changing decisions for six months or so. (Moving away quitting school selling house changing career etc.)   Added some other circumstances not facing you for others who might see.
hm8dxsv,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,1,You’re right. I told myself all day that I don’t want to get him fired but he deserves to be.
hm7740l,oceanleap,11/26/2021,0,You can open an account with Fidelity and buy a Retirement fund like FFFDX . This will have about 50% in stocks and 50% in bonds/cash. So fairly stable and low risk but some opportunity for growth (or loss). Any financial advisor would likely say this is a decent choice. Put your kids as beneficiaries to the account and also make a will naming them as heirs. You can give them both some cash now also as much as you want. I would give it no strings attached if its about 10k. Or you can say youll help them with a house down-payment when they are ready to buy. You will likely have to pay tax on some of the land gain get a tax accountant to help you with that.  Talk to an accountant before you sell in case there are things you need to do earlier.  In terms of taking money out for living expenses most people say anyone can take out 4% of the money er year and have it last indefinitely. At age 73 you can definitely take out more. Maybe 7% per year? So if you end up with 200k after taxes thats 14k per year. Good luck OP. Also ask your accountant to make sure you dont lose any benefits you are currently entitled to.
hm7s79s,93195,11/26/2021,1,That’s the smart thing to do.  That said it’ll take you a bit to unfreeze all three find the passwords go on the websites or call anytime you need new credit.  You have to do it separately for all three there is no single “easy button”.  Right call but still a mild pain in the ass which is why not that many people do it.
hm6ye2x,OozeNAahz,11/26/2021,0,That should be caught when it is transferred into whatever account you are looking at.  It shouldn’t wait to be caught when they are looking for a mortgage.  I wrote software that monitored exactly that for a Very very large CU.    With a mortgage they are looking for signs a parent didn’t loan them $100000 right before they started shopping for a house to make it look like they had funds for a down payment rather than borrowing them.  Or similar.  Basically that you owe more than you admitted.
hm8hcey,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,1,Call your banks security/fraud reporting number now. Make a record now. Screenshot the fb messenger requests. Be ready to call law enforcement if you believe this person has access to your home address. FB can get the IP address of the tellers computer if needed.   I know its a hassle but Id at least open new accounts if not change banks.   On a personal note Im sorry youve been violated this way. You have a right to the sanctity of your home and peace of your life. This person has behaved so badly  inappropriate barely touches it. I hope youre able to resolve this safely and quickly.  But please dont ignore it. I doubt youre his first rodeo.

hm87qj9,tony78ta,11/26/2021,1,If youre a military brat ask your parents for advice? My kids are all your age and military brats too. I did 22 years though and  left the service with a degree no debts and a great job on the outside. I also passed my G.I. Bill money to my kids.  If you join you wont be able to take college for the first year due to training. After that its free. Four years is not a lot of time.  Also get a guaranteed job before going in!
hm7djhx,Triggermike8965,11/26/2021,1,If you havent listend or watched any of the podcasts biggerpockets puts out its definitely worth checking out.

hm8qty3,throwawy12347,11/26/2021,2,There are a lot of jobs right now you could make more than 33k per year working full-time. That only comes  out to $16 per hour for a 40 hour week. If you are in grad school then you must have a bachelors degree which would likely up your earning potential. I would think theres a lot jobs you could  make $20-22 per hour at I would look around and see what else you could get. Id also apply for all the assistance you could get too like section 8 SNAP energy assistance daycare assistance.
hm8f42e,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,A car purchase is not an investment since the value of cars depreciate. So you don’t even know what the hell you’re talking about. Also homeowners aren’t charged capital gains taxes if they sell two or more years after purchasing the house and it being their primary residence the whole time. Only investment properties are charged capital gains taxes.
hm8c5l2,Buttigieg2032,11/26/2021,1,Huh?
hm847wf,Adzehole,11/26/2021,1,If you have a copy of the lease and evidence of the date you were kicked out you really dont even need a lawyer if you cant afford one since its so cut and dry.  Also if youre in the US and filing fees are too much for you you can always do an in pauperus forma petition and if your financial situation isnt great theres a decent chance youll have your filing fees waived meaning the suit would only cost time (and maybe a stamp if serving your former landlord by mail)
hm755kf,dudeson117,11/26/2021,1,I guess I would then claim just one excemption for me as I do not have spouse or children. Why would I want or not want to have any extra witheld?
hm7wtjv,ShowMeTheTrees,11/26/2021,1,I use Chase and Billpay.  Im always able to click proof of payment and print out the image of the front and back.  Id print out your statements from that month and every month since that time.  You can show your landlord:  * The check that was issued * That the funds were debited from your account when they mailed payment.  That should prove that you made every attempt to pay normally.  Ask Chase to refund you and then repay.  Side note - will your landlord take Zelle through Chase? I pay everybody possible that way.
hm8eh27,Varathien,11/26/2021,1,Allys APY is slightly better so Id go with them.
hm7kjhy,PentagonUnpadded,11/26/2021,1,Closing the robbinhood account is probably a good idea. It is one of the most gamified UIs of investment brokerages and engagement harms long term investment outcomes. Especially since the account isn’t an IRA so transactions and dividends incur a tax bill. In surveys of individual investors those that lost their password and were dead outperformed  their active peers since they didn’t change their strategy.   “Blue chip” stock picking is an investment error for the nonprofessional long term investor. Portfolios of individual stocks with less than 50 holdings have volatility much higher than VTI and VXUS.
hm76tih,SchismSX,11/26/2021,1,Thank you for your service
hm8ekzn,ElBrazil,11/26/2021,1,I dont think the extra 2% is going to make much of a difference in how much time it takes to build up his efund but hes losing out on free money by skipping it
hm6ybvf,JSA2422,11/26/2021,3,I agree with basically everything on the Wiki. I think its pretty hard to find yourself at a commission only FA these days.
hm8p7ob,tacotruck2112,11/26/2021,2,Me again...and to your other questions:  Yes you should do an in-service rollover if you can to save fees and get more investment opportunities (like VTI).  Id probably do it once per year since your 401k plan probably has a transactional fee assessed to your account each time you move money out.  Note: doing so may cause tax complications with backdoor Roth conversions (google Roth IRA pro-rata rule).
hm8h9xg,AdamYmadA,11/26/2021,1,It’s very difficult for him to steal your money without getting caught.  Him messaging you on Facebook doesn’t help.   Me personally I would just move the money but honestly if you track debits and credits you should be fine.
hm7h2js,Duc748s,11/26/2021,1,This .....  Also when my twsp does assessments they usually notify the homeowners before hand and they also send out yearly assessment cards with the breakdowns Total Land Dwelling etc.... (I want to say around Tax time)
hm8j0eh,Foreverstoned201,11/26/2021,1,I would install a master power switch to the battery and turn it off when not in use then drive it till it craps 130k isn’t that much my ser Altima has 170 k and I redline and drive it like a track car everyday this is low mileage for me usually get them with 200k all about the way you take care of it

hm7c4ou,OnlyPostSoUsersXray,11/26/2021,1,Yes 100% match for the first 3% and 50% match after that up to 5%.
hm73wcu,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,Get quotes on different cars with your current insurance coverage. On my Progessive policy you can go online enter a VIN and get a quote for exactly your coverage. You will be surprised that some popular cars like Honda Accord have higher insurance rates.
hm6t8id,Missykay88,11/26/2021,1,We have 3 bills on autopay on that card currently. We also pay the entire balance (not just for statement period) off every month. And I went back to the first statement and it charged interest on that as well. Its never had a balance on the due date as its always been paid in full 5 days before the due date.
hm8pelo,TheReverendBill,11/26/2021,-8,Maybe a little bit of an overreaction but the teller is at least violating some professional ethics.

hm88uze,QuitProfessional5437,11/26/2021,1,The market went down today but it didnt go down as much as it did in March 2020 when lockdown in the US was announced.    I would hold. Why would you sell when the market dips? You gotta ride the wave.
hm84suv,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,Mail in only. I dont recommend it. Much wiser to just make the estimated payment. Its really easy to just make the payment.
hm7ceie,OnlyPostSoUsersXray,11/26/2021,1,Yeah Im not so worried about it hurting me financially but rather my concern is making my taxes for this year more complicated.
hm7gtyb,87flash,11/26/2021,1,I would either pay it off or take the loan that doesnt generate interest while Im school and pay that off fully before interest kicks in to have more flexibility
hm79chk,WafflingToast,11/26/2021,2,I would give up the second job for something closer to your parents house.  Car expenses are going to be a big part of your budget now and the commute will be tedious no need to do a 2 hour trip on the weekends as well.  Even if its slightly lower paying you would be better off.    I would find a gym closer to your parents house and I would also make plans on the weekends with friends maybe every two weeks or right after work for job 1.  It sucks to just not stop by and hang out but a firmer financial footing will be better for you in the long run.
hm7j64q,Jonesy135,11/26/2021,1,If your company matches up to 6% that mean you literally double your money…. I’ve heard that student loans in the US are fucked… but I doubt very much they are charging you 100% interest.  So putting your full match in your 401K will leave you better off in the long run.
hm7057p,unchinhairs,11/26/2021,3,What exactly do you need the 2k for - security deposit? Movers? Furniture? I ask because there may be some items you can get after you move thus reducing how much money you need upfront.  How much do you get on a typical paycheck? How much is rent in the areas you are looking at?  If you do need all $2k and your current income is not sufficient you have to get more money. That may mean working a second job - some retail locations hire just for the holiday season so you might be in luck at the moment.
hm780nn,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,4,> Per their terms and conditions they are to respond in 30 days. It has been more than 30 days  Then feel free to file with CFPB because the bank just broke yet another terms.
hm7iqoj,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,11/26/2021,1,Are you dependent on this employer for access to health coverage and necessary health care? Does the employers decision threaten your eligibility for employer-dependent health coverage?

hm7td79,tlollz52,11/26/2021,1,It depends  if you think  you can swing  it. My aunt  joined the airforce because  she didnt  know what else to do. She retired  from. It 20 years later with a doctorate in a field that only has a few qualified  people.  She even worked on something  that was involved  with air force one! On the other  hand you can only spend  4 years following  shit orders and get your  college  paid for and have good work experience. It just comes down to can you handle  the military? I know people  who joined  and got kicked out which is the worst part. I know  other people  who joined and absolutely  hated it but they finished  their stint and got out.
hm7mp4h,kbfprivate,11/26/2021,1,No disagreement there. OP isn’t really clear on their financial situation. Is the $15k student loan at 6-8%? Who knows. Too many factors to tell.  Likely it’s not a high paying job so in the end it’s really not going to move the needle much.
hm77yi4,jennystonermeyer,11/26/2021,1,I pay down and like the chase 5% I added to amz and the cash is instantly usable its nice.  If you carry a balance go low interest.
hm8h8vy,QuietFridays,11/26/2021,1,A few things Im pretty sure dividends dont get taxed at a different rate since they just increase your taxable income.  &#x200B  It looks like you can get up to 4% assuming their subsidiary Fair Invest actually makes profits from their investments.  If they dont you dont get any interest.  &#x200B  And as others point out a membership fee but at least for the next month theres a one time fee option.  Hopefully they make reasonable investments and you can actually make close to the advertised maximum rates.  I think Im skeptical.
hm7ww22,ahhh-what-the-hell,11/26/2021,1,The problem is Bill pay/Auto pay. It’s an archaic system like fax machines because it uses checks behind the scenes of the biller doesn’t provide a digital direct payment option.  He should be using PayPal Venmo CashApp or Zelle with the Landlord.
hm8h01n,mannymoes2k,11/26/2021,1,I would say the biggest current opportunity would be making sure the rent from the tenant occupied unit is up to par with market rate.   Look into the RE subs and I’m sure they could guide you in maximizing your current situation
hm8isq8,Kabby360,11/26/2021,1,Honestly I’d recommend airforce for just a better quality of life. You also have access to TA (tuition assistance). They’ll pay for a degree at each level while active duty 1 associate bachelors masters…etc. typically 6 classes in a fiscal year. You also have the GI bill which is it’s own thing and will pay for a degree as well. TA is for active GI bill is active or once your out.   Military is a pretty good stepping stone depending on the MOS/AFSC you get. If you have any questions let me know. Been in for 10 years and joint environment entire time so familiar with all branches minus coast guard
hm8g3gh,NYNBKFarSuperior,11/26/2021,1,its my take home pay after taxes so I think net. My health insurance for the job has not kicked in yet per contract. There is no commuter program. This job normally pays employees hourly but on my offer sheet I negotiated a base pay of 52k so Im thinking thats the issue? Its a new job and they were supposed to send me a pay stub but said it didnt get delivered properly and sent back. I am just wondering how much am I supposed to be making on that amount really before I make it a big thing.
hm8fyhg,questionmark693,11/26/2021,1,If it helps I run my autopay on a credit card that I quickly pay off
hm8nymc,Ashkir,11/26/2021,1,Yes. I agree. If you don’t feel comfortable because they may be there and it’s a chain bank go to another location.
hm8s967,cricketsymphony,11/26/2021,1,Didnt know about backdoor roth! Will get to researching...
hm7dqcr,UnquestionableBadger,11/26/2021,1,Congrats youre on the hook! Adult care centers can force you to pay for your mothers living expenses and can sue for non payment
hm7ajzz,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,2,It depends on the institution. The terms and conditions of the credit card will give you the answer on liability. But usually AU is not responsible.
hm7z1q2,LiteBulb88,11/26/2021,1,You can certainly make an account with Capital One 360 right now. As for cancelling the Wells Fargo account before it opens youll have to call WF to see if theyll let you do that.
hm7ft48,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,I am on the same boat as you single no dependencies etc... What I have been doing is first setup a relatively good emergency fund one that can support me for a year without a job. Once you build that cushion invest in your retirement. Since you are self-employed I would think of opening a Roth IRA (6k limit a year) and an additional traditional IRA. I also invest directly into the stock market (with what I call play money) and look for opportunities as well to buy real-estate. Should you pay your mortgage? It all depends on the ROI. If the ROI of an investment is higher than the interest you are paying on your house well invest!
hm8sj6m,thefooz,11/26/2021,2,>	Eg: the teller shared your bank account balance with a friend in passing and that friend decided to act as him or whatever  This is just as bad if not worse. How would you feel if your bank teller was telling shady people about you and your account balance? What if you were loaded and they decided to kidnap your kid instead of contacting you on Facebook? This person should not be given the benefit of the doubt.
hm76ltb,Omynt,11/26/2021,1,Here are some cards the author claims are [no-balance-transfer](https://wallethub.com/credit-cards/no-balance-transfer-fee/) fee offers.
hm8mgab,ForsakenAd139,11/26/2021,1,Rent receipts are forged/ faked all the time and most banks wont accept them as proof of payment for on time rent to obtain a mortgage to buy a house for this reason alone. They only accept copies of the cancelled checks money order stubs Pay Pal statement Google Pay statements Apple Pay statements and other unforgeable statements from reputable banking services.
hm8jkcu,hawkxp71,11/26/2021,1,Unfortunately this is a problem with this style of autopay.  The other style where they simply print and mail a check  the money doesnt leave your account until its cashed.       The style where they withdraw the monies immediately and make money of the float until its deposited are common for lower cost banks (like credit unions). The other style the costs of mailing are covered by the bank (and passed on to you somehow.....)     Through the years Ive probably had 5 or 6 autopay checks not get delivered.  Before I changed banks from a credit union to a regular bank (US Bank) I had 1 person not receive the check for 3000 dollars or so.  The CU took almost 6 weeks investigating before I got a refund and in the mean time I had to cover 2 checks (I manually sent the second one).     With my bank Ive had it happen I just stop it and then cut a new one.  Not out any money
hm8bujd,tdp5150,11/26/2021,1,Unless you have him working child labor IRA is a no go… Do a 529 which in some ways is better than a Roth (initial tax deduction from some states plus grows tax free).
hm89b69,Buttigieg2032,11/26/2021,1,Just because she’s your mother doesn’t mean you need to support her.
hm758rt,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,1,How many credit cards do you have just the 3? Good look and see about balance transfer promos with your card companies to maybe get a 0%. Loans is another option but I wouldnt cut cards either you can still use them just dont over spend.treat your cc as a debit card if you have to. Charge something? Pay it immediately. or put the money into a separate bank account and separate from other transactions you have to ensure it balances out.
hm7b2s6,enigma_goth,11/26/2021,1,Education is worth it. Get that college degree. You can finance with a student loan and some employers even help with tuition if you go part time. In the long term you will get better paying jobs and not be stuck in blue collar mostly manual work (unless that’s what you want). Wouldn’t you rather be older with a college education than none at all? Military is hard life. You are still very young get that education before life becomes more complicated and it will get more difficult to go back to school.
hm8e6u2,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,1,I get it. I’m not sure what I can do right now. The bank is closed and I’ve moved the money from the account in question to another though it’s still internal to that financial institution. I don’t have accounts other than my business account and investment accounts outside of that bank to move the money to.

hm7zmkw,addicuss,11/26/2021,1,Bill pay is a convenience.  The way it works is like this. You go to your bank and set auto pay. You set an auto pay for your car payment. Because the loan is with a well known bank BofA has ACH setup and has them on the system. You set up bill pay and your payment goes directly to their account.  You then go in and setup auto pay to a landlord. You dont have their bank info you just have the landlords name and address.you set it up through The same bill pay but the bank cuts a check.  To the customer its seamless but its using whatever information you have available.
hm8tjuc,ThighOfTheTiger,11/26/2021,2,Youre doing well! I wouldnt buy anymore property in Austin if youre planning to move to South Carolina. You also mention you want to grow taxable accounts but conventional wisdom is take advantage of tax advantaged accounts first.

hm76iay,wilderop,11/26/2021,1,E5 makes 5k a month when you include housing allowance in a high COL area so not surprising that higher ups are making double.
hm7e0t0,gettingbetteralways,11/26/2021,1,I mean this is just false.  What if you owe a loan shark money or they’re going to take your fucking leg?
hm81cxd,GreedyNovel,11/26/2021,1,Youll likely be fine. The IRS is very easy to work with they just want to be sure they collect any money owed.  The good news is that if you didnt make very much money (and it doesnt sound like you did) you might not owe much if anything at all. And penalties are based on a percentage of tax owed so if you owe nothing the penalty is nothing.
hm6smz1,Joseluki,11/26/2021,1,You should be checking other stupid advice your father has given you.
hm75jd3,RunGunBlitz,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for the reply.  I hadnt thought about the servicer. I will check with Filo Mortgage to see if they service their loans.  Either way though I am looking to get the best possible rate with the lowest fees.
hm6xlia,colty31,11/26/2021,1,Before the accident. So using KBB should give a rough estimate. Maybe they will factor in the current used car market not 100% sure on that.
hm8te8l,CostofRepairs,11/26/2021,2,$10k in cash is the reporting threshold.   Also if you told them you were loaning that much cash to someone they might be concerned about fraud and file a Suspicious Activity Report.    The Employer info was for the CTR to see if it might be your employer making contributions  under the table to someone. Or to see why say a janitor has a $20K random cash outflow.
hm7c0w2,Fisaver,11/26/2021,1,90% if you can. More the better.
hm88mcd,dequeued,11/26/2021,1,No worries. Its approved now.
hm8llkj,Dariusraider,11/26/2021,1,Somethings gotta give and while its usually not a preferred option honestly getting a nice chunky student loan to stay afloat sounds like the best solution to me. You need to be able to commit enough time to your studies to be worth anything and be there for your kids at least somewhat and constantly working makes that basically impossible. Getting a proper student loan solves all of that without being the worst thing(interest stays manageable time to pay it off before that even etc.).  EDIT: I mean thats in part what student loans are for helping people pay their way through school(the other part is actually paying FOR the school). A lot of people get them to not work through it and on top you have a couple kids to worry about. The idea of getting through education debt-free is nice and all and if one can do it great but its a ton of work in the best case scenario and IMO at this point you are just trying to do way too much at once. Get the loan and focus on the things that matter.

hm8416b,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,Technically I wasn’t “trying” to do anything. I saw a house for a really good price and called my realtor friend. He said don’t go see it without getting pre approved. Gave me the number for the broker (I think that’s the right term) he deals with. That guy had me fill out an application online and came back with this information.  We didn’t get much into anything beyond the collections (I had target and another) because he knew I wasn’t really in a rush to buy or wanted to buy and he said it was best to get myself in a better credit position before trying to buy. I believe he was going to do it for a first time buyer loan - if that helps.
hm76ou2,Kikutwo,11/26/2021,1,Yeah who needs decades of compounding on free money anyway.

hm8dw90,RealMccoy13x,11/26/2021,1,The customers that escalated particular gym disputes. The last one that comes to mind was a gym that kept charging $100+ despite the dispute and even his account manager (private/wealth client) sending an email and letter to the business. The dispute was specifically written that the business refused to answer demands to cancel. They kept charging and I removed his recurring billing indicator which is when they sent it to collections. Their lawyer made quick work of them with the evidence documents provided from initiating the dispute from the card networks.

hm83axd,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,Your quarter 4 payment will be reported on your 2021 tax return regardless of the fact that you make the payment in 2022. If you file before January 15th then you dont make a quarter 4 payment at all you just pay your balance when you file the tax return.
hm8gwwh,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,1,I appreciate that. I hadn’t thought about retaliation but feel well prepared from a personal protection standpoint.
hm74r9l,wanttostayhidden,11/26/2021,1,No reason to stop doing it as long as you pay your full statement amount every month. I pay every bill possible with my credit card to get the rewards and then pay it off and full at the end of the month. Been doing this for many years.
hm8eo1r,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,With your logic every homeowner would be liable for capital gains taxes after selling their house for a profit which isn’t true.

hm6xk7z,greem,11/26/2021,4,Small landlords get a lot of shit on Reddit. Im still not sure why. If you pay on time and dont break things I cant see how that many people can be slum lords.  Most of the time our interests are aligned. Live in the place. Pay the rent. Take care of the place. Let me know if something needs to be fixed. Easy.  Its been disappointing when Ive had to turn down tenants who had unreasonable expectations of what they could afford. I dont want the place vacant willy nilly because it costs me money to find a new tenant but there is no way I want someone forced to live in a place they cant afford.
hm8pygb,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,27,Maybe but if youre wrong the consequences are gonna be hell. If Im wrong she goes to extra trouble to protect herself.

hm8ml4x,Cheesewheel12,11/26/2021,1,I was a bank teller for a year. He has access to your accounts. Not from his home sure but when he logs into the banks software on his day of work he can look up any account at any time. That’s how it walks when you walk up to withdraw as a customer - the teller looks up your name and birthday and _all_ your info comes up in one neat little window - birthday social account values address age. Of course the system logs when exactly they look whom up so the tellers can’t just pretend you came one day when you didn’t really - they have four cameras trained on a till at any time (my bank did). So you’re okay but if the person emailing you is really your teller call your bank and report a breach of trust and confidence. What he did was not okay. They’d have fired me and sued me if I did that teller did.

hm825e7,HarlanCulpepper,11/26/2021,1,You may be eligible for medicaid in your state?  Worth a shot.  Regarding your current bills see if theyll take a lump sum payment  of like $500 and write off the rest.
hm72ijy,shadow_chance,11/26/2021,1,Buying a house in cash for people with bad credit isnt a terrible idea. The terrible idea comes later when they want another new truck and use a HELOC to get it.     The biggest issue is this amount of money to them appears to be do whatever we want money and the truth is it is not that much.   I think you/they should discuss their goals besides new house and truck. And as that conversation develops you steer it towards the understanding of not using all of it for Stuff today and sprinkle in the data on lottery winners with much more money going broke.
hm8qat2,hiddenuser12345,11/26/2021,1,This is a bit more basic advice but if you’re looking to avoid banking fees go with Capital One for both checking and savings. For your liquid savings (emergency fund- if something suddenly happens you want to be able to access that money straight away) they’ve got the highest interest rate of any bank in the area with physical branches (you’ll find some banks with higher interest rates but they’re online-only and online banks usually won’t take you if you’re not a citizen or permanent resident). For checking they charge the fewest fees- no foreign transaction fee no monthly maintenance fee no out-of-network ATM fee no incoming wire fee you kind of get the idea.
hm7rzid,fizzywater42,11/26/2021,1,The majority of bill pay checks from banks work like this. As soon as the check is generated the bank removes the funds from your account. I believe it’s because they often use 3rd party bill pay providers to send the check so they probably have the send the funds to the 3rd party bill pay company who is actually cutting the check and covering the payment when the check is cashed.
hm8cm3x,bigandfullballs,11/26/2021,1,People like you make me money thank you.
hm8jdgt,Annahsbananas,11/26/2021,1,A banker who has access to personal finance information messaging the guy on Facebook asking for money.  There is no silver lining to this. This is gross negligence and an action that does not get a warning or a write up.
hm8ikkn,Mathywathy,11/26/2021,1,The most recommended book by investors is usually common stock and uncommon profits by philip a fisher  Another great is common stocks and common sense by Edgar Wachenheim III  Lastly No Bull by Michael Steinhardt  as for a video series on finance and investing that teaches you to model the future cash flow of a company from their financial reports you should google for Martin Shkrelli finance and investing  to try and locate the torrent for those videos since YouTube deleted his account  if you have no time or effort to spare for such work then try investing in a single all-world etf or other etf appraoch such as the bogle heads method of the Three Fund Portfolio
hm860u6,Kilren,11/26/2021,1,But were not use to having competent managers in healthcare...  When I encounter one it takes me a few months to believe that its not a good cover or a bluff
hm8o01k,ElectricTaser,11/26/2021,1,I’ll never forget the time I went into a one of my banks branches when I was around 25 and was withdrawing $1000 cash and the teller fucking asks “why are you withdrawing all that cash?” I was kinda stunned because that seemed like such a bad move on their behalf. Should have told her to fuck off but instead I just said “I wanted to have some cash on hand why?” And this is where I’m still pissed about it years later. She says something like “well many people will take out large cash withdrawls for drugs.”  Again I can’t believe this teller said this. Now this branch was not my normal one and in an area that is not known for having wealthy residents but the nerve. I wish I would have stopped and asked for a manager right there.
hm6wdv3,microbial64,11/26/2021,1,The problem may be your total income to debt ratio. If you take more debt add another house will the bank loan you? When we sold our first house to buy the second (on contingency) we were in a bad spot as our buyer was having money problems (who the F buys a brand new car in the middle of closing on a house) and had to look at floating both payments. Bank said that our ratio was too high and wouldnt have the option to have both debts.
hm7k5wd,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,Considering you cant put together a paragraph that would be considered passable in an office setting Id take this advice with a grain of salt.

hm7e0zi,Worldatmyfingertips,11/26/2021,1,Well you can put complete sentences together and use grammar fairly well. With average intelligence to above average intelligence I would suggest going Air Force. Study hard for the ASVAB get at least a 75 or above (0-99 scale). With a little patience you’ll be able to get ANY job you want. Just look up AFSC’s (Air Force equivalent of MOS) to see what seems to be something that would interest you.  Although here’s a completely different way of looking at it. Try to imagine that whatever you do you may end up liking it and stay for the full 20 years and retire. Try to think of what job you’d like to do BUT also one that translates to the civilian world. The following are career paths that would benefit you the most while also being the least taxing on your physical body:  Intelligence (Analyst)  Medical  Finance  Cybersecurity  These are broad categories and there are many jobs under them. But I would suggest these because of how they’ll translate in the private sector and without sacrificing (possibly) your body.
hm75eqq,jimspokane,11/26/2021,3,The bank will catch it at some point in the following year after death.  The social security administration distributes a “death master file” that has all SSN’s of deceased individuals.  Banks regularly cross reference their database of open accounts against the DMF and close or do further investigation of any matches.  Once they find account of a deceased person with active use after the date of death it won’t go well for those still using the card.  Closed for fraud is not a good thing to have on a credit file and if you are an authorized user the close reason code will show on your credit report.
hm7uyqm,haggiebaby,11/26/2021,1,That Roth reference in 590-B and what youre saying makes a lot of sense.   And now I know to even ask the company if it can be direct transferred.  Ill also try to verify if this is a pre-tax or post-tax account before I go hire a lawyer/CPA/CFP.  Thanks!!

hm8s5il,cricketsymphony,11/26/2021,1,My employer doesnt have a 401k unfortunately. If that changes I will definitely take advantage of it.   Given my income I thought IRA/HSA would be the way to go for now.
hm82s64,Hundred_Acres,11/26/2021,1,I think this should work. The big factors to consider is food IMO. The reason that I say this is because you will absolutely crush your bankroll if you are constantly ordering food.  Also if you don’t already pay all your bills you should start before you move out.  Other people might disagree but I don’t think there is anything wrong moving into a home rather than apartment but there are plenty of great things about apartments that can make it appealing.   I moved out of my parents house in my early 20s and it honestly changed my life. Not to say anything against my amazing parents but things are just different when you own your space. I think you have a healthy set up to do it.    Although you might also want to consider life insurance Roth IRA and getting a will done if you haven’t already looked into these things.  If you can afford it too once you move out kill all your bills that are non-permanent (school loans). But I don’t think I have to tell you this since you seem like you are doing things smart.
hm83iee,Specific_Emu9399,11/26/2021,1,There are usually local mortgage lenders all they do are mortgages and they will be the best bet. Be very clear with your rep what you want from the beginning and what you want to bring to closing pay towards closing costs in this case from your cash-out. This Includes things like paying for points for a lower interest rate.   Be ready to get all the paperwork you needed for your first purchase the second time around sometimes it’s a pain in the ass but it’s worth it.   I just refinanced in March went from 4.875% to 2.75% good luck!

hm7eoev,SocialIQof0,11/26/2021,1,Hes wrong IMHO. Heres an article I like to show younger people about investing: [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/08/self-made-millionaire-david-bach-a-chart-changed-the-way-i-think-about-money.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/08/self-made-millionaire-david-bach-a-chart-changed-the-way-i-think-about-money.html)  If you dont want to go read/watch here is the most important take away:  The chart show two scenarios:  \-You start investing at 19 and contribute $2000 to your account every year until you reach 27. From 27 to 65 you contribute $0.  \- From 19 to 26 you don’t invest anything. You start investing at 27 and contribute $2000 to your account every year until you turn 65.  In the first scenario you’re only saving and investing for eight years in the second you’re saving and investing for 39 years. Still the person who starts at age 19 would end up with more money in their portfolio in the long run.  Assuming a 10% rate of return the first person would have $1.02 million by 65 while the second person would have $805185 a difference of more than $200000.  People vastly under estimate the importance of time in investing. Time is the greatest asset you have in investing.  Get those matched dollars.

hm6ubzr,Fubbalicious,11/26/2021,1,To echo what everyone is saying this is bad advice.  You should definitely contribute up to your full employers match because not doing so is leaving behind free money at the table.  If you want a guide on where to divert your money and why read the [prime directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) on the side bar and in particular look at the [graphical flow chart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png).

hm7kbbx,JROXZ,11/26/2021,1,I’d like to chime in as a military brat and friend/family to many in the DOD system. Some KIA some disabled some stayed and have gone full career. There’s an entire spectrum of outcomes but one certain truth. You will become an instrument of the nation and politics be damed. If they say you’ve been “activated” whatever straight shot you think you have to starting a career will be met with risk of disability or death.  Really think about what you are willing to risk and if it’s worth it. Good luck.

hm8db2j,bro69,11/26/2021,1,You need 3 months of cash so you can avoid credit card debt. THEN you max out match. Then you max IRA. Then max out 401k. Then low risk brokerage. Then Insurance then stocks. Then play money on high risk. Throw some real estate in there IMO using house hacking and you’re set.
hm8fkwx,dizzyforglizzy,11/26/2021,1,Your numbers give me questions. Your income was about $95k and if the home appraised in 2019 (I assume when you bought it) at $350k then to get a $2300 monthly payment on that you either had atypical loan terms really bad credit or a crazy HOA fee or taxes or something. If you put nothing down then that’s like a 6% interest rate and some taxes and etc in escrow isn’t it? rates in 2019 were way lower than that.   Never mind all that you’re saying that ~40% of your income being dedicated to housing is miserably tight in your scenario? 30% is kind of a bench mark but in high cost of living areas or major cityscapes then that number can easily push to 50%. Especially if he’s saying he’d have to pay an equivalent amount in rent alone. Also he’s got a fairly reliable tenant which I know he said he’s not running numbers. OP is at 30% so is matching the standard.  Honestly the numbers would say you could afford it. Don’t do anything stupid with the truck and keep saving you’ll grow in to the house assuming your income is reliable. With the tenant then it’s easy

Putting it up on a lift checking fluids frame damage obvious stuff is what I plan to have done and thats $97 with tax and takes roughly 90 minutes. Obviously some depth to take that long.

hm851wo,Wahoo2K8,11/26/2021,1,Seconding what t-poke said.    You pay your insurance to handle this.  Let them do it.  The fact that the other driver was (or may have been) drunk is more or less irrelevant.  That’s a criminal matter between the driver and the state.
hm8h1of,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,I got my info from the IRS too. It specifically says you’re only liable if the value of the car increases not if you bought it for less than it’s worth.
hm8hanu,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,No generally they would have to cover the claim.  But they could cancel you and that cancellation for suspected insurance fraud would show up on your CLUE report causing you to have a difficult time getting insurance in the future.  Its not worth risking losing your insurance to commit fraud to avoid adding a driver that is unlikely to increase your rates.

hm7e5dk,Just_the_typto,11/26/2021,1,trade the lincoln for something not fancy and cheap and something you dont have to worry about... meaning you dont have to worry if you can afford payments and full coverage insurance and also meaning you dont have to worry about the reliability.  When people come up they tend to spend way more than they should because having nice things makes you feel good but trust me if you get the lowest payments possible for a usable car in your area you will be able to invest in things that you really want. Maybe a house or early retirement?

hm8qjdl,omg463643,11/26/2021,1,Last transaction prior to the 24th was $40.83 made on the 23rd which is included in the statement   Two charges of $40.83 which total to the statement balance of 81.66
hm7ct3t,Pickaa,11/26/2021,1,Not being cashed that on them then. You arent their bookkeeper to also go and run their errands and balance their checkbook. Plus a lot of banks should be copying bank checks to verify their own records to begin with.

hm85o0k,SwordfishTough,11/26/2021,1,$5-15k is a big range but even the higher end is totally reasonable given your income.   In making purchases I would decide ahead of time whether its a short-term or long-term piece and spend accordingly. E.g. if your apartment only fits a 4 person dining table but you want to have at least an 8 person dining room when you buy a house dont splurge on the table. But if your bedroom has space for a king bed and you see yourself needing that long term spend more on the bed.  Start small and build up over time once you figure out what youll actually end up using.
hm8bls4,KJ6BWB,11/26/2021,1,When keeping the books for a company assets is a debit account and getting paid is a debit.  A business expense or paying money credits your asset account.  Thats the perspective Im used to.  Point is my bank (USAA) sends out regular checks and that amount isnt pulled from my account until the person receiving the check deposits it.
hm7cdnh,Quack_Shot,11/26/2021,1,You can just go into any tax office. Doesn’t sound like you have a lot. IRS E-File is down for their yearly maintenance and such until January (usually 3rd week in January it’s back up). Filing now you’d have to do it by paper which it’s faster to just wait and e-file.
hm7i6ys,ricedt68,11/26/2021,1,I agree with everyone on here. Get a roommate or two and split the cost. Thats what I did when I was 16 until 19 years old then I went on my own from there on out.
hm77j11,Jeheh,11/26/2021,1,>Email your Finance department  I would forget the email.  I would grab my supervisor and personally go to payroll the second I clocked in to get this handled before doing anymore work.
hm8mpzz,loveittodeath,11/26/2021,1,The rule is just a guideline. Most people arent in your situation. If it were me Id start thinking about my personal goals and allocate money from there. Have enough in your savings that you have an emergency fund. Think about other short term savings goals and when youd like to reach them. Decide whether or not you want to increase your personal spending. Invest.
hm7oypa,Ok-Meringue7413,11/26/2021,1,Around 30% of gross income is removed for taxes/401k/health insurance/HSA. For example my last check was $1700 from my full time job and $400 was removed for just taxes then an additional $130 for 401k/HSA/Medical.
hm8jahk,SephoraRothschild,11/26/2021,1,You need to move ALL the money OUT of the account. Even PayPal is better at this point because you can then move that same money from PayPal to a different bank.  A different account at the same bank is not sufficient or safe.

hm7x1or,gguru001,11/26/2021,1,I m answering a question you are not asking and maybe you already know the answer but people that retire from investment income will generally maintain investments but the investments themselves will change to favor ones that have historically carried less risk.  This has been standard enough that some funds will do it for you based on age or by your choice.    The other thing is to never annuitize a fund if you dont have to.  Just withdraw what you need or what you are forced to withdraw by law.

hm6wbut,Frogsplash48,11/26/2021,1,I think ours is pretty clear-cut but lmk if you think it’s worth finding the fine print. The benefits guide says that for “maternity services” :  PPO: Primary care doctor: $30 copay Specialist: $60 copay After you meet the deductible you pay 20% coinsurance for remaining prenatal delivery and postpartum care up to the out-of-pocket maximum  HDHP: After you meet the deductible you pay 20% coinsurance up to the out-of-pocket maximum
hm74t64,HistoricalBridge7,11/26/2021,3,We need a tiny bit more information. What’s the interest rate in your student loans and other debt if you have it? If it’s high say 5% or more it might not be a terrible idea to buy the debt down. In general it’s always a good idea to max out the 401K up to the company match or as much as you can. It doesn’t make sense if you’re saving zero money after maxing out.
hm8r46w,seridos,11/26/2021,1,Excellent metaphor

hm736ep,ahj3939,11/26/2021,2,Merrill Edge isnt bad. You have plenty of no fee low cost index fund options and it counts towards BoA preferred rewards where you can get some pretty good credit card rewards and other perks.

hm7zrih,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,> Im very pessimistic about current market conditions and think nearly everything is in a bubble but unfortunately I dont have any sound advice as to where to invest to protect against such a bubble bursting  Im not sure how old you are but this has been parroted since 2010. The reality is that no one has a crystal ball but his mother is going to have to take larger risks than most her age in hopes of gathering a nest egg sufficient enough to mean anything.
hm8tir6,Linkkie,11/26/2021,1,https://finance.zacks.com/federal-banking-rules-withdrawing-large-sums-cash-1696.html  This might help.  Also look up structuring deposits. If you get all 20k at once and deposit it theyll report you to the IRS but its not a bad thing. Intentionally breaking up your deposits to try to bypass the 10k reporting is illegal and called structuring.
hm7r8qj,Potato_hoe,11/26/2021,1,This isn’t accurate - at least not in my case and everyone I know from college. We worked hard got internships many turned into full time opportunities or found a good starting position after graduation. Yes it’s true that most people don’t graduate and immediately make a ton of money but we made more than enough to live a comfortable life. A couple years of experience led to a better opportunity and the next and then the next where I now make a very comfortable salary and my career opportunities and salary will only continue to grow for the rest of my career. People think because they don’t graduate making 6 figures that college isn’t worth it and that is absolutely not true. College set me up for success in the long term. I have great benefits and incredible 401k match and a job in a field I love.
hm8gke1,Orangesunset98,11/26/2021,1,Again employers sometimes take out even more and if you have health insurance its not taking that into account. Thats a baseline but with a higher income there is a higher tax bracket you need to achieve employers overcompensate
hm7azn6,bkdlays,11/26/2021,2,The burden is on you to prove it was paid.  Your bank sucks if they cant say if the check was chased.  The landlord probably didnt get the check.  You will need to re-issue that check.  I suspect eventually chase will reconcile the missing check and the money will come back into your account.  &#x200B  These are some of the issues with billpay.
hm7ywhs,AzeTheGreat,11/26/2021,1,If it was vested immediately youd still be better off contributing up to the match and then pulling it out and just eating the 10% penalty.  *Unless* you would be able to save enough to max out the match later in the year so youd just be shifting around the timing of things.  Of course thats dependent on how exactly your company implements matching since that would leave match on the table for some plans...  Its always nuanced its *not* just false.

hm72gde,Ecstatic_Being8277,11/26/2021,2,>What you propose is (again) Social Security fraud! If she disinherits her moms bequest yet still receives a benefit this is fraud!  SSI is a needs based program.  Subverting the resource limit is outright fraud!
hm81x1k,CQME,11/26/2021,1,>Im not sure how old you are but this has been parroted since 2010.  Older than you apparently lol.  I also have to say that most bears in 2010 were quite optimistic.  Most bears were quite pessimistic in 1999 and 2007.  > but his mother is going to have to take larger risks than most her age in hopes of gathering a nest egg sufficient enough to mean anything.  IMHO this is a bad mentality.  As one approaches retirement age one should find comfort in the modest gains one would achieve while their nest egg whatever it may be bears fruit.  This is not the time to be sailing in a hurricane.  You reap what you sow.
hm89pdu,Morepaperplease,11/26/2021,1,This is going to sound insensitive- however I just went through this   The guilt and wanting to make it better is overwhelming.  But this was bigger than me.  She needed way more than I could do and if I did sign up for helping it would consume me rusk losing my family create a vacuum of financial and bury me.  She needed medical attention and I let the State take over. They sold her hoarded house they put her in a nursing home where she can now bathe ever day get clothes food watch tv interact with other people and have health care in  a safe place.  She was not capable after her stroke of using assisted living because she refuses to clean herself and surroundings- and she is happier!  It worked out. But I had to let go.  I am sorry about your situation.  Some things are just bigger than ourselves.
hm8ayrh,anand2305,11/26/2021,1,This. Have told the same to my kids. Dont get involved in rat race. Earn enough money in few initial years and then go travel the world before coming back to settle back in daily grind. Other advantage is you never know where your destiny takes you to settle down there are millions of opportunities world over.
hm6t1j7,MDfoodie,11/26/2021,2,We can’t help you. This is you v. them.  Do you have a credit card to use in the meantime?
hm8mrpn,ThisIsAMonere,11/26/2021,1,It sounds like this “rule” doesn’t apply to you then.  This rule is designed for people who tend to overspend on “personal spending.” It helps them try to keep their “personal spending” down to 30%.  You clearly need way way less than 50% for your general needs so you should budget it such a way that ignores this 50/30/20 rule and instead prioritizes investing and saving for goals instead.
hm6v21t,mynewaccount5,11/26/2021,2,Mine has a single chapter so that may be part of the issue.   Im an engineer so we mostly dont even have unions.

hm7l1zc,ReluctantLawyer,11/26/2021,1,They might be driving expensive cars at a huge financial risk elsewhere. People can have lots of nice things on the outside but be in a really precarious position that could tumble easily. I *totally* get the pressure to have something nicer when everyone else does and the desire to reward yourself for hard work and get a nice car to enjoy. Those aren’t small things to deal with or easily dismissed. However your overall financial picture and your family’s financial future is way more important. Look at the long game and set yourself up for success over the decades to come now.   You’ve gotten a lot of great advice here. But take a close look at what you’re getting with new vs used. In the last year a lot of people have reported selling used cars for what they paid for them new. There’s a lot of demand and not much supply so you might not get a much better deal by buying used whereas a new car might have much better financing terms and a great warranty. There’s a lot to consider! Good luck.
hm82taw,RondaMyLove,11/26/2021,1,Id like to second this. Check out modernstates.org too. They have free online classes to prepare you for clep testing. Theyll also pay for the test. Tons of colleges take these as credits giving you one or two years of free credits plus it will open doors for good online schools like Western Governors which charges under $5000  for a six month semester for as many classes as you can get through in that time.  Theres a story on there right now about a young man who got his associates degree two weeks before he graduated high school then completed his bachelors by 19 and his masters 8 months after that.  Even if you then join the service youll be in much better shape with a degree.  Stay safe.
hm8lomq,thentangler,11/26/2021,1,First of all… make sure the relo “bonus” is pro-rated.. because papa Sam taxes bonuses at 45%. So your $6000 becomes just a little more than $3000 and your $2000 sign in becomes just a little more than $1000.   Regarding your car I’m guessing it’s a beater you just used for college… In an ideal world I would tell you to put some money into it for new batteries and tires and drive it to CO. It would be around $1200 anyways.  However you now have a job and need a reliable mode of transport.  The prices of cars aren’t going to come down in the next year until the semiconductor supply is back to normal…. I would suggest you shop around for used cars… but compare with new cars too. You never know….
hm6wh1i,zorinlynx,11/26/2021,2,That is the most bullshit argument Ive ever heard.  Im actually more impressed by a Yahoo address than a Gmail address because it means a person has probably been online longer.   And if its something like netcom.com or earthlink.net even more so.

hm7bre6,SomethingAbtU,11/26/2021,1,Its 11/2021. Why is this landlord now telling you this many months later?  Are they attempting to charge you interest or any late fees?  Is this a giant rental property management company with sloppy records and incompetent staff?
hm7zkyh,ender323,11/26/2021,1,Because other developed countries (namely the EU) have mandated that banks introduce certain features and comply to certain standards. The US banking system is not nearly as heavily regulated and the banks have no desire to do it of their own accord. So our instant payment options are largely limited to services offered by third parties and sometimes integrated by banks like Zelle Cashapp and Venmo.

hm7hn7a,GracieLikesTea,11/26/2021,1,I had a secured card at Capital One when I was rebuilding my credit. At one point I asked them if it could be converted to an unsecured card and they said no they didnt do that. But about a year later they just spontaneously sent me back my deposit as a check and converted the card to unsecured. I still have it and its the oldest line on my credit report.

hm7pycj,idriveadodgestratus9,11/26/2021,1,No this is not accurate. It just means they are supposed to put your interests in front of their own.  Your best interest is not paying the fee period. They dont recommend that
hm8nqge,roombataxi,11/26/2021,1,Set financial goals.  Figure out what your targets are and when you want to meet them.  Work backwards from there to figure out what you want to be contributing today to meet those goals.  That way youll have a reasonable guidepost to how much you should be saving.
hm7yhcm,ciderenthusiast,11/26/2021,1,If it were me Id not contribute anything at all to retirement until I had a larger emergency fund such as $5000.  Then contribute to get the match.  Just be sure you actually save the money not spend it and delay retirement contributions.  Hopefully it will only take a few months to save the \~ $3500 which is just a blip long term and wont actually lose you too much in employer match.  Having cash savings also really helps peace of mind.  Then my next step would depend on your job stability and student loan payment interest rate.  If you have family to fall back upon for financial help and the student loan interest rate is low (< 4% ish) Id focus on the retirement fund as compounding interest will make that money work better for you long term than paying off the student loans early.  If you cant or wont fall back upon your parents building a healthy emergency fund (3-9 months expenses) before paying off debt and/or bumping up your retirement contribution is a good idea.  And $52k at 24 is good congrats!

hm7i2t3,JustCallMeSmurf,11/26/2021,1,Not enough detail to provide you reasonable financial advice.   Interest rate on student loan debt?  Any other debt? Monthly budget? What is 401K invested in? Whats your risk appetite? Any major plans for any large purchase or change of lifestyle in next 5yrs?  Your dads trying to explain to you that its probably better to pay off your student loans versus invest money today hoping X% annual return in 35yrs.   Id put a minimum 3 months expenses in emergency fund high yield savings account.   The next step really depends on whether its worth the immediate savings right now to pay off the student loans and forgo the company match temporarily. But we dont know your budget and thus dont know your runway for how quickly the debt can be paid off
hm853yj,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,This isnt the question you asked but something to be aware of youre making state estimated tax payments...  If you itemize your deductions then the date you make your state estimated tax payment DOES matter. You can only deduct the state tax payments that were actually paid in 2021 on your 2021 tax return. So if you make your 4Q state ES payment on or before Dec 31 2021 then you can take it as an itemized deduction in 2021. If you pay it Jan 1-15 2022 it would be an itemized deduction in 2022.
hm702lq,shadow_chance,11/26/2021,1,Its usually phrased as household so including his is fine. It just needs to be estimate. As long as youre not trying to gain large credit lines for fraud they dont care.
hm6tts2,DrGreenMeme,11/26/2021,1,> The bottom of the chart where it has the asterisk makes it seem like there is less of a return for your investment the older you get.  But I could just be misinterpreting the numbers.  The chart comes from The Money Guy show and is just a conservative estimate. Over the short term (the closer you get to 65) the more volatile your investment could be so they’re just trying to represent a realistic expectation.  > Knowing to invest in an index fund is more helpful than just saying “invest”. My ex was a financial advisor but he recommended Chinese stock and invested in Doge coin so I’ll probably ask a different one.  Yeah I should’ve made that clear. I’m not a financial advisor but I know that the majority of them would say index funds specifically the S&P500 are considered safe but powerful investments. I would never recommend someone invest in crypto or single stocks unless they are using a very small amount of their portfolio and realize the risks.
hm8rufa,300zxTTFairlady,11/26/2021,3,Yeah totally understand but hopefully it keeps him at bay. Good luck with everything. You might have saved someone in the future with getting scammed.

hm8h8q8,93195,11/26/2021,1,There’s always a catch. Yes SIPC insurance protects you from them going out of business.  It’s not FDIC insurance though and does not protect you from investment loss.  They are calling these “wealth building accounts” not savings accounts.  It’s NOT an HYSA.  Their website makes this quite clear:  “Not FDIC Insured. Although Fair will not transfer losses on the pooled investment account to customer accounts these accounts are NOT FDIC INSURED and are subject to possible loss.”  To get the 4% you also have to be a member ($7/mo) and have a minimum $25K balance.  They are also quite clear the rate is variable not guaranteed and subject to change at any time.  Is this a sweet deal?  Possibly.  But it’s not without some risk and there are some conditions.  It ain’t a slam dunk.
hm71f79,Spcynugg45,11/26/2021,2,No problem it’s helped me in the past and I’m sure it could help you. Some 0% deals will even give you more than 12 months so while it’s best to pay off CC debt as soon as possible if you’re really disciplined you could do it over a longer period.   So for example if you’re having to put $800+ / month on the CC to payoff $9000 + interest in one year if you had 18 months to pay off $9450 at 0% interest you’d only need to pay $525 a month. That gives you an extra $275 for your car payment without impacting your budget at all.   Some people are going to take issue with using that kind of budgeting logic since you’re adding an unnecessary expense and not prioritizing debt reduction at all cost but if you automate payments and set it/forget it then it’s a great way to solve your financial issues over time without it taking up a lot of brain space.
hm8gnqr,QuitProfessional5437,11/26/2021,1,You can change the parameters of your mortgage loan at any time. You can tell your lender that you want to put  less money down.

hm778fh,DeaconPat,11/26/2021,6,Last January my landlord contacted me and said he hadnt received my rent check when he normally has it via autopay on the last day of the preceding month. I checked with my credit union and saw when it was mailed but it had not been cashed (credit union confirmed the status of the check as not being cashed). I offered to drop off a new check right then but my landlord elected to wait a couple of more days. The check didnt arrive after a couple of more days so I hand delivered a check to him. The autopay check showed up 2 days later.  Bottom line is the US postal service is a mess and delivery times are all over the board even for local mail pieces. My guess is your payment got lost in the USPS black hole and your landlord was not proactive enough to resolve the issue that month (apparently he/she is not worrying about staying on top of such things).  My advice (worth \*exactly\* what you paid for it): write a new check to cover the lost check + any late fees/penalties due according to your lease and call it a day.
hm80ge2,Disastrous-Log3686,11/26/2021,1,I’m sorry for the last paragraph of your comment can you explain the part where you say that “they got their money back” who exactly are you referring to?

hm8smgh,ThePwnR4nger,11/26/2021,1,Does his message have glaring issues with English and grammar? Does the word “Kindly” show up? Does it seem like he is trying to progress the conversation in a way that puts pressure on you? Does the facebook profile have a very low number of friends and little to no info? If you try to look up the teller via a facebook search does the same profile pop up?  There’s a very good chance that a scammer created a fake profile that looks like this bank teller and is using it to contact random people to get them to send money either via cryptocurrency cashapp or friends and family paypal. The above red flags are things that are dead giveaways.
hm7pkgr,oceanleap,11/26/2021,1,This. Aggressively saving when you are young is a great idea if you can do it relatively painlessly. Your expenses will likely go up later in your life (buy a House have kids) and investing early gives you the magic of compound growth. Also you dont know where the ups and downs of life will land you. Investing now gives you the flexibility to reduce contributions later if you need to.
hm7gmiq,Chonan_Akira,11/26/2021,1,I retired 13 years ago. Ive kept my portfolio diversified and always have some in a money market fund. Been withdrawing money 4 times a year. The market has been doing so well Ive basically been living off my profits. Im going to start taking my social security retirement benefit in Jan 2022. Ill probably drop my IRA withdrawals to 1 or 2 a year.
hm6wmkb,TommyTuttle,11/26/2021,3,Your dad is wrong. The match is free money on income that you’re avoiding tax on. Take it. Letting that money sit around compounding its interest for the next forty years will make your retirement easier without lowering your present income by much at all.  Don’t forget having 6% pretax deduction only lowers your take home pay by maybe 4%… yet your 401k will be getting 9% of your gross pretax income. Your 6% + your employer’s 3%. Plus market gains. That will set up a big account which will help you later when you need to buy a house: you can withdraw or borrow against it when needed. Take the full match my friend. You’ll be glad you did.

hm8k4aq,Perma_frosting,11/26/2021,1,Benefit of the doubt is nice but think if it this way: if he’s willing to do this with you he will try it with someone else. Maybe the next mark will be an old person who thinks anyone who works for the bank must be trustworthy and gets talked out of more then they can afford. Or maybe he’ll escalate to showing up at people’s houses. Someone who is willing to use customers personal information like this has proven they should not be working at a bank.

hm7ewa3,Sjetware,11/26/2021,1,I work in banking. There are two main methods for Bill Pay systems good funds and risk based models. In a good funds model the bank debits your account by the amount of the check and holds onto it such that any check they have the bill pay provider write has the funds guaranteed to clear.   Other models issue the check and wait for it to be cashed to withdraw the funds assuming the debit to be covered by the member. You could technically spend the money that the bill pay provider sent a check for and then the bank is on the hook to honor the check / recover the funds from you at that time. Its a risk based model the bank doesnt have to hold onto the funds and deal with the oversight of it.

hm8tfc6,kushhcommander,11/26/2021,1,Youre making two assumptions:  One is that the car market will correct it wont.  The vehicle market has changed forever in so many ways.  Every class of vehicle is at its highest markup ever due to supply and demand.  Second is assuming youll take a deprecation hit.  Used cars are up 30% YOY compared to new cars being up 12%.  When you drive off the lot I guarantee you in 3 years you used car you bought new will fetch close to what you paid for it.  Look at the truck market used trucks 3 years old with 40K miles are going for a few thousand less than new.  Yes it is worth it and if he needs a car and is borrowing a car that isnt reliable how much is that worth to him?  Probably a lot.

hm8eliq,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,Well when they cash it their information is shown so yes that is proof that my landlord cashed it. I hand deliver my check and get a receipt as well. Sometimes they are away and I video myself bringing the check over and save the footage from my dash camera showing I delivered it because I don’t trust them. If we want to pick this apart nothing is infallible. But I find my way the safest for my situation.

hm79zpt,Heriros,11/26/2021,2,It depends when the landlord brought it to his attention. If the landlord is suddenly a year later saying he missed a rent payment thats on the landlord. If the payment was actually never received OP would have been getting rent statements for double the month after the payment was missed. Which would mean he was aware of the issue so itd be OP since he ignored it.
hm8gils,3rdIQ,11/26/2021,1,Do some research on mutual funds which are basically a group of individual securities (stocks bonds etc.) that are managed and can be purchased without a huge minimum. They are appealing because a funds holdings might include several stocks you are interested in they are easy to buy and mutual funds have diversity.  Mutuals will publish their top 10 holdings and a summary of their objectives.   For example I have a mutual fund that owns stocks from Facebook Amazon Apple Microsoft Google and Tesla and many others.
hm7kcxc,vglyog,11/26/2021,1,You’re correct! Oops.
hm78w36,Birdy_Cephon_Altera,11/26/2021,3,Based on what you wrote seems like the payment was sent as a physical payment (like a bill payment cashiers check) but was either never received by the recipient or was received but never deposited.  Money is deducted from your account the moment the cashiers check is created as if you had purchased a money order for example.   Some banks deduct immediately once payment is sent out some banks only deduct once the check is *cashed*.  Seems like Chase is one that deducts immediately (the bank I work for does it this way too).    Generally speaking uncashed cashiers checks dont just automatically have funds return back to your account if the check is not cashed.  You have to make a stop payment request to have the funds returned.      Since the recipient didnt receive the check in the mail (or did receive it and lost it well never know for sure) the next step would be to 1) call a Chase representative and request a stop payment on that lost check so the funds can be returned back into your account.  You can then 2) arrange payment options with the recipient to pay for the lost check - either by re-sending the payment or making a payment through other means.

hm76gxn,inkheart58,11/26/2021,1,I should firstly point out that I have no financial qualifications just an interest in sustainable personal finance.  This is the first I’ve heard of Stablecoin 😅 but from what I am reading it seems to be stabler due to the fact that it is backed by a physical asset. Whilst this is theoretically stabler than normal crypto I would still class it in a similar category to something like FX trading or investing in individual stocks. You’re still investing in single entity with a single point of failure. If Elon decides to start keyboard bashing Stablecoin there’s potential for that 9% ROI to quickly switch to big losses.  On the other hand investing in a diverse investment fund like many of the ESG ones will distribute this risk over many entities spanning different industries currencies and countries. Elon can’t influence that on the same level.  These may have a lower return than 9% but generally much safer and you can leave your money in them with little maintenance required.  Also Stablecoin doesn’t seem to be any different to other cryptos when it comes to the environment.  Crypto is an exciting and very interesting technology that can have impressively high yields but so can gambling. And aside from the returns we must also question whether it is responsible to back something that requires racks of GPUs running 247 doing intensive computation at the expense of co2 emissions.
hm83i7t,takabrash,11/26/2021,1,Yeah as annoying as it is the landlord has no contract with Chase or their autopay system. They want money from OP and he likely owes it.   If I tie my rent to a pig every month and send it waddlin down in the general direction of the leasing office those folks dont have to chase down a pig when they dont get paid- they chase me.
hm82btg,Scr0bD0b,11/26/2021,1,If you think you can net more than 1.49% investing it then take the loan and ensure your other money is invested to do so.  If you dont want to risk the investments but want to remain more liquid then make payments...  Make extra payments if you want... Pay it off in full whenever you want.  Or just pay it down cash if thats your preference so that you dont have to worry about investing or paying any interest at all...
hm8rt3f,MakeItHomemade,11/26/2021,2,Ya- I forgot about back door.   We file jointly and we aren’t quite to the max for married- and I thought the back door was more optional vs mandatory with an income max. Good problems to have.   Having lived in a 2/1 750 sq ft duplex do look at your options for two bedrooms. It’s not all about square footage.   Being able to “shut out” work on off hours is great.   If you can see your work space from every angle except your bedroom- it may feel like you are always “on”  I have a big ole house now- I went from 750 sq ft to living in a 350 sq ft RV to about 3500 square feet home.   We have one entire room that we (first time home buyers) didn’t realize has no good real use. That square footage would have been much more useful in the laundry room / pantry.   Watch out for lifestyle creep- where you have more money so you buy more things because it’s more affordable.

hm6ugf6,Ok_Basis_7059,11/26/2021,1,Just because there’s an estimate doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not a total loss. It will depend on the value of the vehicle. I believe most insurance companies will total a vehicle if the estimate is around 70% if the value.  To see what your car’s value is I would just look up what they’re going for in your area. You can look on cargurus.com or whatever used vehicle website you prefer. Just be sure to look up your year/make/model and as close to the same mileage as you can find. I’m sure you can find outliers so I’d just take the average of 3-4 of them and go from there.

hm6thdi,Ecstatic_Being8277,11/26/2021,1,Contact your state Department of Labor.  File a complaint there.  They will investigate and get quick results.  Best of all costs you not one red cent!
hm8370t,niemesrw,11/26/2021,1,Correct I usually tell people to do this enable multi-factor authentication on all their accounts and switch to gmails advanced protection program if they can in order to protect themselves pretty simply from ID theft. The idea is you make yourself just a bit more difficult to attack than the next person.
hm79pbf,jpv1031,11/26/2021,3,(Full disclosure - Im prior service Air Force)  If youre not looking to be a career soldier and more geared to just putting yourself on the right path for your future you should go Air Force or Navy.  Better quality of living more career oriented opportunities all with the same benefits of the GI Bill and VA loans.  Personally I went Air Force cause I didnt want to be stuck on a ship for months at a time.  I was a 3COx1 - Comm Ops/Computer Operator and it directly translated into my civilian career as I am currently a systems engineer.  Regardless of what branch you decide to go its an experience I will never forget/regret having.  Best of luck with everything!
hm7okz5,Particular-Earth-453,11/26/2021,1,Is the $230K an actual bid? That sounds astronomical for 900 sqft addition even with a bathroom. If you were building up and had a lot of structural work I could see it being expensive. But if you’re building off the back of a one story house that doesn’t add up. Do you have a breakout of the costs? I’m sure it includes permits architect/construction plans and the actual work. But still. I wouldn’t add 900 sqft for $230K. Unless you don’t plan to move ever I guess.   To answer your question yes that amount of money is normal. That’s how any mortgage works (look up amortization schedule). You’re essentially taking out a mortgage. 3.5% actually isn’t bad you might be able to get slightly lower between 3-3.5%.  Estimated cash to close is the wrong term. I think that’s how much you are getting at closing and they’re deducting the closing costs from your mortgage amount.
hm7raif,UpbeatPiglet3217,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for the help !!!
hm6xiue,One-Kind-Word,11/26/2021,3,Thank you. I’ve already had two offers to help which I’ve ignored.
hm8cba1,wutzeeheck,11/26/2021,1,How many people have to tell you youre wrong bruh. Take the L
hm79kpg,cavynmaicl,11/26/2021,1,Also contact your state’s department of labor and the board of licensing for hospitals as not paying promptly could be a sign of other issues and those two orgs would lead investigations. Circle them in immediately.
hm8bwaj,RainBowSkittlz,11/26/2021,1,I use Zellie its usually immediate and you can look at the activity using your account
hm8abrs,Cruian,11/26/2021,1,>I think with VTI if I buy one share I should be fine to spend whatever on it after or maybe I’m mixing it up with VTSAX.  Youre mixing them up. At this time Vanguard does not allow direct purchasing of fractional ETFs. It does for mutual funds. So every time you buy VTI you must do so in multiples of whatever 1 share costs.  There are brokerages that do offer purchasing fractional ETFs but Vanguard is not one of them at this time.
hm8nzyj,EBofEB,11/26/2021,1,If it’s a major US bank then wouldn’t the new balance have been printed out on the receipt?  I don’t understand  why he would have had to write it down.  And if it didn’t print I would think he would print out something else that would show it.
hm72ovh,reijn,11/26/2021,1,Oh sweet so we have plenty of time to pay it off then it sounds like?
hm6wq31,personalfinanceta5,11/26/2021,1,That makes a lot of sense! Will try to focus on basics + a decent couch.  Only cheats I think I will make is a nice speaker and a good vacuum because I love listening to music and recently had the opportunity to use a nice vacuum and don’t want to go back to a handheld one.
hm77j48,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,0,This is the most important question. Closing a card with a long history can drop your credit score quite a bit. If you have any plans on credit checks like they said above I would not close it until after.
hm7a14j,Aqualialeaf,11/26/2021,1,Thank you for your response. Ive read the post and most of the comments and unfortunately I dont think it applies to my situation I might try to reach out to my bank as a last resort. I just wish I wouldve known how unreliable they were and how the whole procedure worked before getting into all of this.
hm76b5c,nouseforanametoday,11/26/2021,1,Also no water.   In my town when the water is shut off to a house the house is automatically condemned.
hm8osu3,jasesaces,11/26/2021,1949,Yep couldn’t agree more. This person should not be in banking at all. That is extremely unprofessional and downright wrong. I’m in upper management in banking and if this happened with one of my employees I would be absolutely mortified.
hm7ykjl,JigglyBuddha1991,11/26/2021,1,Yup. 9 years in the Army 31 series (a long time ago) and have been in telecom ever since
hm7jc0q,Werewolfdad,11/26/2021,1,Leave it to Reddit to bring out outrageous exceptions just to act like I’m not right.    I guess If there’s a world ending meteor headed towards earth you can skip the match too.
hm84yd6,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,Cars are depreciating assets. It’s not liable for capital gains taxes. You’d have to pay income tax on it it’s different. There are private sales of cars all the time with people paying in cash. It’s literally impossible to know how much somebody bought a car for most of the time.
hm7tcze,meliaesc,11/26/2021,1,They already answered. Run the numbers to see what the difference is.
hm7jxof,Just_the_typto,11/26/2021,1,I kind of dislike the term saving because that means like a savings account to most... Id say 10% weekly until you have know what you made this year from your tax return. Once you know that you can divide it by 12 and then take 15% of that and invest it this way assuming you make more the next year you are putting about 10% in. If you are young high risk is the way
hm6utmv,fatFire_TA,11/26/2021,1,It sounds like your business has certain risks all of these can be handled through insurance. Specifically general liability insurance for your business. There are also other ones like D&O insurance etc. You can also create custom insurance plans etc for your specific risks - go speak to a commercial insurance broker/agent.
hm8tfna,City_Alarmed,11/26/2021,1,Yeah tell me about it. I spent half my day calling customer support transferred to tax dept insurance dept (homeowners 🙄) transferred escrow dept told that Fanny Mae handles my PMI called Fanny Mae said that I’m not their customer but Freedom Mortgage is their customer it’s business to business and the mortgage company contacts them not me called customer support at the mortgage company again and they “sent an email to their research team and they’d get back to me in 5 business days)… 😓😞
hm7m9ov,Werewolfdad,11/26/2021,1,I think when we’re talking $20/week it doesn’t really matter either way so might as well get that match.
hm7wb5k,kidneysc,11/26/2021,1,OP says he only needs 20k for an efund and has 70k to work with.   Buy 20k over the next 60 days and continue to hold 20k in cash till they vest in 12 months. Then toss that 20k cash into a better investment than an HYSA and use the I bonds as an efund.  There might be a good reason I’m not thinking of but if there is OPs FA didnt mention it.
hm78ads,mobappbrowse,11/26/2021,1,>	Ironic that their mother and I could get dinged for just trying to be responsible with the money and make sure their college is taken care of from this tragedy (vs just spend the money on normal raising the kid stuff like groceries clothes typical daily expenses).  Except you’re trying to prescribe what the child can spend the money on.  They may decide to go a different path. It’s not up to you to decide what the child must do with the money after they turn 18.   If you can put the money in a custodial account and invest. The benefits of a 529 aren’t that great that it’s worth legal wrangling when they come of age.
hm6xb62,sirzoop,11/26/2021,2,Open a IRA and a taxable brokerage account with Schwab Fidelity M1 Finance etc. Invest in simple index funds like VTI VT VOO VUG etc.
hm849gk,oceanleap,11/26/2021,1,That would be a good question for your tax accountant. It will still likely be best to make a will so th at any remaining assets can easily be settled. So maybe a trust is not necessary? But the kids would likely get their inheritance faster with a trust.
hm82czm,iced_out_pickle,11/26/2021,1,Let me tell ya if you can get your SO to use YNAB your life becomes so much easier. Were not going to combine finances until after the wedding so we have our own personal bank accounts and then a joint one to pay split bills out of that we set up recurring transfers from personal>joint every month.    Rent and utilities gets pulled right from the joint and we each have a debit card to use for groceries date night etc. Every other week we sit down and make sure  our joint budget matches in YNAB used to take like 45 mins but now were on the same page and it often takes like 5mins. Its only going to get easier when we combine finances and share one YNAB account after we get married haha
hm891jd,whiskytangofoxtrot12,11/26/2021,1,The original account would need to be a Roth so more than likely no it cannot be rolled into an inherited Roth. And yes the money can be sheltered for 18 years because they fall under the minor rule.
hm8m73d,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,Its also important to realize that the LTV will have an impact on your interest rate.

hm8tm9l,WafflingToast,11/26/2021,0,You will be fine.  The bank will make you whole if he tries to withdraw anything.  You have enough proof.
hm8mte2,Err_rrr_rrrr,11/26/2021,1,Wow thank you. I truly just want to make sure my folks are set that’s all. You’re right.
hm8qbpu,volsrun18,11/26/2021,9,If it’s anything like my bank corporate would have someone in there before the branch manager could even react. Corporate is 100% the way to go here. Bank risk/security/fraud do NOT joke around. I don’t know my risk officer’s first name.
hm7skin,93195,11/26/2021,1,If you’ve got multiple quotes the lowest one is the current “fair market price”.  That said it doesn’t mean it’s a particularly low price just the fair market price right now.
hm8jvng,enleeten,11/26/2021,1,So must be Wells Fargo.
hm8t132,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,There are some bookkeeping magic behind the scene such as shuffling between risk-taking investments and money market. The reason why qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate is because the same money has already been taxed at the corporation level. The brokerage needs to be able to identify which companies the dividends came from.  > If Fair will not transfer losses to customer accounts   Until they run out of money.  > and your money is protected by SIPC  Assuming it is currently in money form when bad things happen.  If it is in shares SIPC will give you exactly the same shares back the same shares that lost value.

hm7uwqs,nobodyoukno,11/26/2021,1,> they often use 3rd party bill pay providers to send the check  Can confirm. I had two tenents each used a different bank than the other and their auto-paid checks  came in the same envelope.

hm8hljc,trmoore87,11/26/2021,1,Yes but that wasn’t the question.
hm7u41p,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,1,Then we agree. As I said before the terms outlines the liabilities.
hm82upt,ForeverALone_Ranger,11/26/2021,1,Many thanks.
hm8jlx6,WWGHIAFTC,11/26/2021,1,Are you willing and prepared to be trained to kill other humans simply because they live on the other side of the line on a map??  This is not a financial question.
hm8dmon,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,Well for one this costs money whereas a check does not (for me in US). But secondly I am sure to write in the memo section of my check as cashing the check acts as an acceptance of those terms. Reasonably my landlords could claim I paid them $XXXX for something else. Would it be thrown out in court? Surely. But I rent from scumbags and I’d rather cover my ass with a check.
hm8h5s9,brittyn,11/26/2021,1,That would be up to the bank to confirm once it gets reported. It wouldn’t be the first time I’ve seen a banker contact a customer on social media. Seems too coincidental for this to be a social engineering tactic.
hm87qtr,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,Yes 2021 was a wild year for the dependant care tax credit and totally flipped the script. So far there is no talk of extending that into 2022.
hm87zip,Gotanis55,11/26/2021,1,This is an interesting thought that I had not considered. Ill have to look into this.
hm8haw9,LiteBulb88,11/26/2021,1,Do you have a 401(k) or similar available at work? If so you cant contribute pre-tax money to a traditional IRA as your income is too high.  In any case I would definitely max the Roth this year since you can.
hm6xr2s,lurkerwho,11/26/2021,1,This is not true (at least in most cases as I don’t want to say you are lying). I’m in my 30’s and received survivor benefits all through college as long as I was a full time student even in grad school.
hm8in9h,jthomas287,11/26/2021,1,I am a bank manager.   Tell someone. They 100% have access to your accounts and should not be working with peoples money. This is a huge breach of trust. This employee should be fired and black listed for this.
hm7k2bj,martinluther3107,11/26/2021,1,not with all banks.  The bank I work at doesnt work that way with Bill pay.
hm7ci6d,iheartnjdevils,11/26/2021,1,It looks like Chase withdraws the funds and sends what is basically a cashier’s check to the recipient. So it’s not an ACH transaction but they still should be able to check if it was cashed or not.
hm78ynf,metaverse-emperor,11/26/2021,1,Can I ask for your rationale? Curious because everyone has said the opposite.
hm7zb2j,Missykay88,11/26/2021,1,We never carried a balance. Ever. Ive never seen a single other card charge interest on purchases regardless of when you pay off the card. My citi card has never charged interest on anything and I pay it exactly the same as the credit one card. Grace period does not apply when the entire balance is paid long before even part of it was due. Like for the last statement month at the end of the statement period the balance was $0. Because I had already paid the card back to $0. But it still charged interest on all purchases made during that statement period.
hm7exm1,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,Start budgeting and saving for maintenance and repairs.  Shop for cheaper insurance every now and then. Dont just stick to the same one every year without shopping.
hm81tj1,patmorgan235,11/26/2021,1,It makes it easier to keep track of the contributions for each child to make sure everythings equal.

hm8ltad,QuitProfessional5437,11/26/2021,1,Not to rain on your parade but in your current situation you will not be able to get a mortgage. Probably wont for at least 2 years.   You need to get a real job where you pay taxes and you need to start paying your credit card bills. Does your spouse have a green card?  If she does she needs to work on her credit too. She needs to apply for a credit card.  You shouldnt ask your mom to put her as a co-signer. Dont put that burden on her. She needs to get her own credit.
hm6wttn,personalfinanceta5,11/26/2021,1,Makes sense! Thanks! Biggest expense will be couch. I have a dining room table already and will try to thrift the chairs.
hm70c5n,Duc748s,11/26/2021,1,Keep the house for now. Your monthly expenses are low vs renting in the market (or buying) today. Concentrate on upping your marketability in terms of trade/skills/$pr hour and save as much as you comfortably can. Look into Trad/community college/certs to keep education expenses low and once you reach where you want to be job/pay wise decide your next move if you want (or at that point keep the house and rent it out as a LCOL area is good for retiring especially if you have a nice lot/acreage)
hm6xesv,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,Banks bill payer systems generally send electronic payment if the company receiving the payment is set up in their system to receive the payment electronically but for all others they literally mail checks.  All banks do this this is totally normal and legal and the source of tons of late payments.
hm7hos2,DetN8,11/26/2021,1,If a landlord isnt set up to receive auto payment via EFT (or see below*) you can still set it up with your bank to where they literally mail a check every month.  *One place I was living used to take EFT at no charge. Then they changed management to where they started charging a convenience fee for EFT and card payment. I refuse to pay that so I set up the check mailing thing. At that point I paid water to them separately. At some point they combined the payment and it was a different amount every month so I would walk to the office have them calculate my bill (I could see it if I used their app but I wasnt going to do that) and write them a check right there. Then they got all confused when I asked for a receipt.
hm76lau,PizzaboySteve,11/26/2021,-1,Ha. I stopped after your first two sentence and didn’t waste my time reading any more. Yeah. They did a bang up job on you. Talking shit online because someone doesn’t agree with your opinion. Did I hurt your wittle feelings boo? You wouldn’t say that to me in person. Fuck outa hear. Enjoy your negative outlook on life and people. Lame.
hm7d5ku,3rdIQ,11/26/2021,1,Kudos for reviewing your financial options and working on a financial plan at your age.  Make sure its a written plan so you can see if your goals are working or make edits as needed.   I would do some research into Traditional IRA verses Roth IRA so you understand the benefits now as well as in the future.  All the major brokerage houses have information for example here is [FIDELITY IRA](https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/ira-comparison) information page.   Compound interest is a very powerful tool and the earlier you start saving for retirement the larger your reward will be.  Even if you feed an IRA with $10/month contributions its better than nothing.
hm8f6vn,TrumpsBoneSpur,11/26/2021,1,It depends on the insurance company.  They may provide both options.  It usually takes less than a half hour for inspection and estimate sheet
hm7wwwy,1nd3x,11/26/2021,1,individuals Mileage may Vary but my experience with the military (especially on exercises/at home training) is for you to do your best...cuz thats all they can really ask for  They will **ABSOLUTELY** push you and push you hard....there is the standard that you have to meet and they will push you to go as far past it as they can get you to. but...ultimately how far **you** go is up to **you**  If the standard you must meet is doing 25 pushups they will push you to do 30...35...40...45...........100....  If youre done at 30...youre done at 30...you dont **need** to break yourself they are simply trying to show you that your pre-conceived limits may not actually be your limit.  The trick is knowing that you as an individual can and will get better...so...you had better get better. If you can do 30 pushups today...I expect you to be able to do 31 next week...  Also...if youre done at 30 but you arent collapsing exhausted you arent done...I dont care if you actually *are* exhausted at least **act** exausted. done is at your limit pushing too far past your limit is how you get hurt.
hm84yrw,ProPainful,11/26/2021,1,Start an roth ira start a 401k yes both. Set up automatic payments to both doesnt have to be huge amounts since youre recurring investing but remember youre savong for retirement in both. anything left over halve it and save half of that / invest the other half in whatever you fancy or do 75 / 25 whatever youre comfortable with investing.   Anything left after that let it sit in your account to double over into your next saving round or use for whatever.
hm8gi05,DblePlusUngood,11/26/2021,1,Do you actually live in Nevada? Some states offer income tax deductions up to a certain amount for contributions to 529 plans. (Not Nevada because it has no income tax). If you live in one of those states it can be advantageous to have two 529 accounts one each for you and your wife to maximize the tax savings.
hm77b6f,mannymoes2k,11/26/2021,3,tbh i’d give up my “social life” and a “gym” vs having only a $200 cushion PER MONTH. Seems batshit insane not to IMO.   You can find friends and a gym. Even if just for a few months or a year to jumpstart your savings cushion.
hm7v7aj,kcrab91,11/26/2021,1,Well I understand what you are saying and many need to save way more but your statement isn’t true. You can save too much. You have to enjoy life at all stages and sacrificing the now for the future can be a poor choice. Nobody is guaranteed tomorrow.   Save as much as you can but enjoy today too.
hm7odwi,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,What kind of lenders are you using? Yes he might need to set up an escrow but either way those taxes and insurance need to be paid. Sounds like you didnt shop that loan around.
hm7zl3g,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,1,> can I call my bank for a chargeback because they keep avoiding me as well as not wanting to replace the mouse.  Sure you can.  The bank will ask you your side of events.   You may receive provisional credit.   Bank will ask merchants side of events/terms/etc  Bank will then make a decision.  Either reverse the provisional credit or make it permanent.  Either way chargeback does not mean cease working with the merchant.  Bank will ask to be updated as to your progress.
hm8gozh,CyberSecurityGuy1,11/26/2021,1,That is correct yes. I ended up going with the 1time lifetime membership for $99 and have over 25k with them but yes it may not be the best choice for everyone.

hm6v99o,addicuss,11/26/2021,0,Bad advice. You can  actually show him too. Find a retirement calculator and model what 24% and 6% at a modest return with accompanying match looks like.  I think it will be eye opening for him. I used nerdwallet so lazy assessment but:  4% .54 M  6% .74M  8% 1.04M  And finally 12% 1.49M   Now 6% when your 28 drops you down to 1.13M all other things being equal   https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/retirement-calculator  Needless to say.. do the match

hm7z6dv,w33dcup,11/26/2021,1,You can always change beneficiary to another family member so that already limits downside. It doesnt have to be just for your kids (read the rules).  Personally I have one acct for each child.  Less mgmt to set them and forget them.  I put them on the asset allocation glide path and let the plan do the work.  No need for me to go in at age X and reallocate.    Now say my kids dont use all the money.  Cool then I can use it myself in retirement for some qualifying classes.  Or I can just sit on it until grandkids are ready. Thinking creatively with these accounts can help with asset/wealth creation for generations to come.

hm8tqz5,Fizzicyst,11/26/2021,3,We had a similar problem with our landlord back in 2009. Fortunately we have always paid them with a cashiers check drawn from our credit union. When they tried to sue us we brought the records of all the checks and the one we supposedly didnt send was in fact cashed by them.  The judge took one look at our records and asked them if they had seen it. They said yes but they still thought we owed them a month. The case was thrown out and they were ordered to pay our costs.

hm814y0,teresajs,11/26/2021,1,Youll want separate accounts for separate children.  You cant withdraw the funds for multiple children from the same account in the same year without incurring some penalties (cant have multiple beneficiaries). If there is overlap in their education years or different kids spend different amounts in college (and maybe youll allow the child who saved money to spend their excess) youll be better off with separate accounts.  Im not sure that you can split an account and roll partial account balances into other accounts.  Keep the current 529 stop further contributions if its fully funded open a new account and fund it for the second child.
hm73jwj,Smokey_Katt,11/26/2021,2,The “treated as an eligible rollover” part makes me think you are correct roll over the pension to a Roth IRA for each of them put it in a low fee index fund and done.  But depending on what 590-B says it might have to be a traditional IRA too.  Otherwise you might have to pay income tax on the $40k.    Check to see if you can transfer like $10k a year from regular to Roth and not pay taxes on that since they will have no other income.    Don’t forget to think about state taxes depending on your state.
hm8aqj5,Scarovese,11/26/2021,1,If you look at the prime directive flowchart here I think you need to be realistic about your budget. Once you can separate wants from needs a bit better you can follow the steps there and prioritize things. I wouldnt be making a car payment in your situation. I would get real about your food budget if youre constantly planning on going over.  I would definitely move back in with your parents but until you can get real with yourself that extra money isnt going to solve your problems.

hm838m9,ForeverALone_Ranger,11/26/2021,1,A lot of antiquated businesses (like landlords) dont accept direct payment here in the states. Some will only take checks. In addition American banks havent bothered making direct payments an option because they havent been forced to.
hm76tcq,AltOnMain,11/26/2021,1,It’s not really bad advice but you should be capturing the company match if at all possible.  The idea with paying off the student loan is that they are high interest so assuming your interest rate is 6-8% paying more than the minimum could be thought of as a guaranteed 6-8% return. Your company match is also a guaranteed return is a sense.  I think you could look at it a few different ways but you could make arguments for either. The match would have a much higher return but you can’t really use the money for 30 years so the net present value is much lower.
hm7ddw8,Penguinis,11/26/2021,1,> financing an education just isn’t worth it when you consider how expensive college is vs the pay of the job you aren’t guaranteed to get.  Depends on the field/degree. Getting a history degree will be a lot more difficult to pay off any loans taken out than say a degree in tech. Nothing is certain and for sure people do it either way but the odds are better if you major in a more desirable field.     > I just can’t seem to find something worth putting my time into that sets me up for a good future.  I think maybe you might be looking at this whole thing the wrong way - instead of waiting for/finding something that sets you up - why not actively work within what you already have going for you. You work at FedEx and assuming your living situation is stable at your grandmothers why not do classes that you can pay for out of pocket no loans and no 4 year commitment that you arent sure you want to make. Is that road easy? Nope its work but so is joining up and going that route.      > I just need some good solid advice on what I should do.  You should do some real hard introspection on where you want your life to end up at. Good future is vague try and map out concrete goals you want to accomplish. Then once you have those in hand - look at what the options provide as a means to achieve those goals. Pick based on that not just because at 19 you can’t seem to find something worth putting my time into that sets me up for a good future. At 19 its pretty ok to not be locked into a career path that youll work in till you retire.
hm7tvos,knort4,11/26/2021,1,There is a customer service number on the front or on the back of the card so maybe you will be able to speak with someone by telephone as soon as possible.  Hopefully they will be able to help you in resolving this but you might end up having to bear the loss.  This has happened so often that the retail stores who sell the cards have made it a policy not to issue refunds on gift cards.  Unfortunately there is a scam going around where crooks scan the numbers off of the cards while they are still on the rack in the store and they wait for unsuspecting buyers to purchase the card.  Somehow the crooks know when the card has been activated and they also know when funds have been deposited to the card and so they immediately spend the money hoping that you (the cardholder) wont find out about the purchase until its too late.

hm712e9,ductoid,11/26/2021,1,You make it sound like no big deal but I wouldnt want to live with tinnitus or back pain. (I did have plantar fasciitis for a year but I recovered from that.)  Id rather just work an extra year while young and living with a relative for free and bank the income for tuition than do that.  Me I was on a military base in Germany in the 80s and so was potentially exposed to mad cow disease and the army never even did me the basic courtesy of notifying me I only know from being rejected from donating blood. And so then I lived for a few decades with the knowledge that I might have a dormant brain disease that would make me go psychotic at some point and then kill me. Now theyve determined thats no longer a risk (?) but even without symptoms or a diagnosis ... just the knowledge that I might have it and it could pop up decades after exposure and resentment over how the military treats it as not our problem caused a lot of stress.   That makes me pretty edgy over the mental and physical risks of being in the military how they react to it and like I said elsewhere the implications of how that plays out during a pandemic. I mean we get called to man covid wards when nobody else will accept the risk. Were always going to be expendable.

hm7cmd1,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,The *only thing* that 401k contribution changes is making the number in W-2 Box 1 smaller by the same amount (plus some other texts for your information). It does not come with any new tax forms or require you to file any differently. You do not deduct anything because the W-2 already takes care of it.
hm8k8f6,SlowJamm,11/26/2021,1,For someone to see 6 months of living expenses and think someone is just going to give some away is moronic. Im coming more towards the side of reporting him. I see the valid points.   If it were me though Id block him and move on. No fear of relation and get a new bank. If he does it again let it be someone elses problem.   Lastly why would someone ever speak up in a bad neighborhood? Live in fear and possibly danger over something someone else did? Or try to live in peace in a hard situation. Its not like their one act of speaking up changes anything or would 100 acts of speaking up. Some changes needed are to big to blame on them not speaking up is the reason their neighborhood is bad. Such bad logic
hm8aszn,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,It’s not. Everyone here is insisting it is though. Why would you be charged capital gains taxes on a depreciating asset if the value is going down?
hm6wf8e,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,3,> I have to pay a significant alimony for another few years and child support for over a decade. They feel like deductions from net worth much like a mortgage would be deducted from net worth.  You can use present value formula to get an equivalent pay off amount today. This is a way to pretend your non-debt based obligations as debt.  For example if you have to pay $X per month for N months pick a discount rate r such as inflation or mortgage interest rate and:  PV = payment / (1 + r) + payment / (1 + r)^2 + payment / (1 + r)^3 + ... + payment / (1 + r)^N. This is the same kind of calculation as mortgage credit card debt etc. with the difference that you already know the present value of mortgage/CC debt.

Publication 523 Selling Your Home provides rules and worksheets. Topic No. 409 covers general capital gain and loss information.  >In general to qualify for the Section 121 exclusion you must meet both the ownership test and the use test. Youre eligible for the exclusion if you have owned and used your home as your main home for a period aggregating at least two years out of the five years prior to its date of sale. You can meet the ownership and use tests during different 2-year periods. However you must meet both tests during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale.

hm8k1k1,UGA10,11/26/2021,1,Start by contributing to your 401(k) at least up to the employer match.  Choose low cost index funds and look for a total US index and an international index.  Then create a budget so that you can determine what is left each month.  This will also help you determine your mo they expenses and help you establish an emergency fund.   Once you have an emergency fund consider using some of the $80K in your bank account to fund a Roth IRA for 2021 ($6000) and then in January fund it again for 2022 ($6000).  You could then consider increasing your 401k contributions over the enouer match depending on your budget.

hm8d4ea,bpt1047,11/26/2021,1,I personally dont think its bad advice just a different viewpoint. Different people are at different stages in life and prioritize different things. Some say you may be throwing free money away by not getting the match. But then youre not getting the most out of your paycheck to pay off loans or increase savings.  I think what you have is a good balance but it really depends on your budget and how much you have left over after your goals. If you end up with $200 extra every month then increase your 401k contribution. If you end up on the tighter side leave it where its at and get rid of those student loans ASAP after your e-fund is established and comfortable for your needs.

hm85hlc,AmayaOkami,11/26/2021,1,Ive tried enlisting a few times before. First in the army. I was 17 and still needed parental consent was warned to NEVER sign unless you know for SURE what you are signing up for. Had an ASVAB score of 70. Not the best I dont think but not half bad. They made me wait until EVERYONE picked their jobs first then told me nothing was available and I just had to sign and would be able to pick again before boot camp... Luckily I had family in multiple branches I talked to about it and I told them no. I was berated and intimidated for about an hour before they realized I wouldnt have the consent so was sent home.  Then tried air force after I turned 18. Unfortunately I had JUST gotten a tattoo and was told it would need to be removed before I could enlist. Fuck that! So instead I went the trade route. I got a 2yr degree for medical technology (run all the lab tests Drs order) and my program found the loopholes in my state (FL) to allow me to sit for my 4yr degree license with just a 2yr degree. If military seems like too much of a commitment (though by the sounds of it might be a good route with covering room board and help with paying for college) I highly recommend looking into TRADE schools. HVAC electrical medical technology IT surg tech welding... Its usually less (filler) school cheaper and most guarantee internships/apprenticeship and usually can even guarantee job placements.  Sometimes traditional college isnt for everyone. But its not the ONLY option. I will always support military as a lot of my family have served but Ive personally gone the trade route and am doing what Ive always wanted and even managed to get my bachelor degree without student loans by getting a decent job right out of the gate.  Tldl: check out trade colleges as well. Programs around 2yrs with guaranteed experience and work placement

This makes sense if you consider: 7.65% for SS/Medicare \~15% for Fed income tax withholding \~6% for NY income tax withholding and \~4% for NYC withholding = 32.65%.  Make sure that youre aware that aside from the SS/Medicare the withholdings are typically estimates. If you have more withheld than you owe on your tax return youll get a refund. If you have less withheld that you owe on your tax return youll have to pay the balance when you file your return.

Can’t go wrong in IT. I did four years and got out and took advantage of the VA education benefits. One of my buddies who went in with me just retired after 20 years. He’s got a military pension and isn’t even 40yo. I recommend it to everyone who may be a little lost after high school.

hm82r4k,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,> Its only going to get easier when we combine finances and share one YNAB account after we get married haha  Thats the way to do it. If you can get aligned on finances now youll be in a much better position once everything is combined.  In my case I oversee all of our finances but we hold a monthly budget update so shes aware of where everything is. At this point I know our exact financial picture within 1-2% at anytime. Its great. Nothing wrong with being clear and transparent on finances.
hm7t4oy,qikink,11/26/2021,1,If they ask you say thats where it came from. They now know its more windfall than income and make their risk calculation accordingly.
hm6sfjq,wild_b_cat,11/26/2021,1,Still unnecessary for the most part. Possibly down the road when you have large balances in both accounts you can start thinking about tax efficient placement. There are actually different theories on how best to do that.  But it doesnt sound like youre there right now.
hm8m6zm,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/26/2021,1,$3000 or that neighborhood doesn’t seem worth it for declaring bankruptcy.  Also if you get married before bankruptcy goes away you could be causing a substantial liability to your SO (eg someone who already has a full time job and may wish to buy a house).
hm8rtdd,ZenGuruji,11/26/2021,1,When you ask if you are going in the right direction -- right direction in what sense?   What is your long-term goal? Sounds like youre trying to build equity to build a new house but is that the specific purpose you are asking about?
hm6t86c,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,12,How difficult do you anticipate dealing with tax forms will be?  Hint: Its not difficult at all.
hm8abok,Iamfree25,11/26/2021,1,u/foreveralone_ranger speak with claims department. They should be able to fax proof if it was cashed. Or ask to speak COTS to see if they can check. I worked for Chase bank for 5 years. They should have be able tell if it was cashed even if it was a bill pay.
hm83pdh,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,I wish I knew who to call! All I can find by googling is mailing addresses (different ones) and yes TD is connected to the card. How did you go about finding the correct number?

hm7qade,kalirion,11/26/2021,1,If the bank cant tell him it was cashed then they shouldnt be able to tell him they cant stop it.
hm7xz5x,maggiemoo91,11/26/2021,1,Same in NZ banks stopped accepting cheques this year. Seems bizarre that its still common practice in the US!
hm8fkmh,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,VA loans are VA loans.  Talk to navy fed or usaa for a pre-qualification before you make assumptions.  You could also move to a lower cost area.  With 100% disability there is very little financial incentive to stay in a high cost of living area unless you are able to also hold a high paying job.  As a generalization those jobs usually arent the most accommodating to vets with disabilities.  If you are looking for work Im always looking to hire vets and have positions all over the west coast.
hm7aay6,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,11,I understand where you are coming from but I think his dad is thinking about emergency funds. He has none at this time.
hm78ane,krone-icals,11/26/2021,1,With a bank representative over the phone. I have a case number for it
hm8i217,SlowJamm,11/26/2021,1,Snitches have things happen to them. Im not saying OP will but sometimes you just move on. Retaliation isnt caused by saying no its caused by hurting someone else even if its their own fault.   Just my view not saying your wrong.
hm78kqy,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,6,No. The bank expects the account owner and authorized user to be family members and live in the same place. Its on the account owner to tell the AU.  > but I called the bank just now and they said in the event of her death I would be liable for any balance remaining on the card  Theyre wrong. But AU account could still affect your credit reports so you should get yourself removed if things start to go bad on the account.
hm7uyrj,sicbot,11/26/2021,1,Look at the numbers:  4% = $2080 /y or $173.33 /m   6% = $3120 /y or $260 /m  Before tax its only $86.67 difference a month. I think your safe to take 6% if your going to do 4%.  If your struggling and living paycheck to paycheck it may be better to get your 3-6 month emergency fund ready before you contribute to your 401k. But that call is up to you. This really depends on were you live/ cost of living.  Contributing to your 401k as early as you can is really important. Its not about timing the market its about time in the market.  GLHF
hm6vcj0,93195,11/26/2021,1,It’s very close to totaled.  Repairs exceeding 75% of the value is the standard most insurance companies use.  Either way you’re not really going to make anything off this.  If it’s economical to repair your check will be equal to the repair bill often paid directly to the repair shop.  If totaled they give you a check for the value and keep the car.  Basically they buy the car.  What really sucks is that cars that have been in an accident are typically not worth as much as ones that haven’t - everyone wants to see a “clean” CarFax.  And there is no compensation for that loss of value if it does indeed get repaired.
hm6y88p,joemetarei,11/26/2021,2,Yep that’s terrible advice. You’re literally missing out on free money. Not “free” money from the government ACTUAL free money.
hm8jyqy,LooksAtClouds,11/26/2021,3,You have to make sure the brokerage knows that the contribution is for 2021 if youre making it in 2022.
hm8aqze,MaCuban,11/26/2021,1,I also imagine that the clearing time for ACH/Checks or any other EFT (except wire) is a HUGE risk/fraud mitigator.  As inconvenient as it is I imagine the cost of fraud would be greater without it. eg: try reversing a wire after it clears.  other instant payment options are essentially shifting that risk off the traditional bank but i am sure in the fine print of those services it is mostly on the customer.
hm81g1p,Wahoo2K8,11/26/2021,1,If you have uninsured motorist coverage this MAY qualify under that coverage.  However this is state specific.  Some states require the other driver to be identified for uninsured motorists coverage while others do not.  If you don’t have uninsured motorists or this does not qualify under that coverage your next option would be to file a claim under your collision coverage.  If you don’t have collision coverage there isn’t much more you can do.  If you vehicle is totaled and you have the appropriate coverage you mr insurer will pay you the actual cash value of the vehicle minus your deductible.  If the vehicle is repairable they will pay the cost to repair minus your deductible.  Honestly there’s a TON of “if this happens then this wil occur” situations.  So you really need to either share your state and coverages (if you know your coverage) or cal your insurer to determine what coverage you have.
hm7w3dz,Blah12821,11/26/2021,1,Don’t buy from California. You’ll pay more for parts associated with emissions.

hm75w9i,red5765,11/26/2021,2,Oh yeah definitely go for the 0.5% one.  I use Ally which is also 0.5% and I know they make it easy to create categories for your savings goals.  But theres some other good ones out there too!
hm7v0qi,k_lena,11/26/2021,1,Fair enough I somehow managed to totally ignore the 14k owed - my bad!
hm7v5r8,King-Juggernaut,11/26/2021,1,Agree with this. I wish I had financial sense before starting my 5 year contract. I also allowed my recruiter to straight up lie to me out of my Intel contract. DO NOT trust your recruiter. Other than that I would reccomend any young person without a clear direction strongly consider the military. Im definitely set up well because of it.
hm72sn7,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,OK Ill have to do a six-month contract (<--common in Ireland) at a fairly entry-level position of maybe only $40K (€35K) while I switch onto the new career track but thereafter I should be able to secure a salary in line with my related experience so around $60K (€50K).   Ill work in Ireland while I save and live with my Mom so Im guessing I can save a lot pretty quickly.  Then I can reasonably expect to earn up to $80K (€75K) in 3-5 years.   My job as an office manager maxed out at $50K with no opportunity to grow further and I felt like I was always broke so the gamble seemed worth wrecking my credit.
hm8owb8,NycLegalHelp,11/26/2021,3,US banks are positively prehistoric compared to anywhere in Europe. The only place more backwards is Hong Kong because it’s largely paper driven.
hm85o10,scar-l_sagan,11/26/2021,1,I work for Chase so I can provide a little context.  Venmo like any other app such as Cash App has little to no recourse to get your money back. if you accidentally sent money to the wrong person or someone got ahold of their number/account /etc. there is no legal recourse to return the money.  Something like a credit card has security features to get your money back promptly (a la charge back) which is essentially what youre paying for using a credit card.  Tldr: need to pay with verifiable proof? Pay with someone elses money (the banks) not yours. Pay off your bills with your money
hm72edi,ResoluteClover,11/26/2021,1,Interesting. PNC never did that for us they kept the money until the check was cashed.
hm7jyxu,UnquestionableBadger,11/26/2021,1,Thats really between you and the legal system if it comes down to that.
hm74xpu,ALPHAPRlME,11/26/2021,3,If you intend to get vested then match. If not and you are using this to springboard to a better or higher-paying position in the same field your fathers advice is sound. Money is never free even if time is the only cost.
hm7hs3d,Parasingularity,11/26/2021,1,Always always contribute enough to get the full employer match. Then learn to live on the rest while still building up your emergency fund and paying toward your student loans.
hm7oseo,Annoying_Auditor,11/26/2021,1,I commissioned in 18. It was 500 and books. I drilled with my state NG interned and refereed soccer. Could I have spent less money on random crap. Yes but at the same time it wasnt easy to go about it debt free.
hm8jxi1,TheRealMrsVakarian,11/26/2021,1,Yeah I was thinking something along these lines or somehow the tellers information was compromised. I wouldnt go in guns blazing but definitely still recommend reporting asap
hm87bzm,wirexyz,11/26/2021,1,Sell sell sell. Better to sell at the top than at the bottom.  This is the big one guys.

hm7can2,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,No need to hire a CPA :) and yes! you should definitely start contributing to the 401k as soon as you can I would just put the amount the employer is matching so ask what % they match and start with that.
hm8l8ze,petron5000,11/26/2021,1,Screenshot to the CEO of the bank and the head of fraud and risk via email. CC the branch manager. Tell them you are closing all your accounts on Monday.   Insist on them handing you a bank draft for your entire balances in person by the manager at your convenience on Monday.
hm7plsy,wearitout222,11/26/2021,1,So now Im thinking Im gonna buy a van then bring it back for the offer. Use the 7000 to reinovate the van and get it ready for the road. Hopefully the offer stays good til i get my van. Would love it if i get my van this week.

hm8nx6k,MyPasswordIs222222,11/26/2021,1,Huge misconduct!  I can appreciate your positive attitude. But this is also about protecting the next person. I would consider doing it all in writing to make certain it is documented in your own words.
hm8fk81,ThisIsAMonere,11/26/2021,1,LOL. This is just making me laugh at this point.  Primary residences are excluded from capital gains taxes.  Sure there’s a potential that my earnings on my vintage furniture is not called “capital gains” and is merely “profits” and maybe you’re correct that the profits on a car is not called “capital gains” but either way cars as subject to taxes on the total profit earned based on the original purchase price and the selling price and appraised value has nothing to do with this.
hm8js6l,CyberSecurityGuy1,11/26/2021,1,3 percent is pretty decent.
hm8cdkb,6553321,11/26/2021,1,If the check was in the correct amount named to the correct party makes to the correct address doesnt type responsibility end there? If the check was cashed isnt that the end of it far as you are concerned?   Your lease agreement probably lists allowed forms of payment which should include check sent to a given address.  I would let them know Im sorry to hear that and here is everything you can provide to help them in using the police report. To reach out to you if there is anything else you can do to help. Also all them if they want you to issue a stop check let them know what the amount for that would be and that youd take it out of the replacement check you file.   As far as I can tell they have no leg to stand on so you should be active. Although if there is a tenants union or something I would sell legal advice from them.
hm7pcok,YoshiMain420,11/26/2021,1,Yes you can.
hm7zosz,teefdoll,11/26/2021,1,I might ask them to stay a little longer most places here require two months of pay stubs. For the 401K I actually got a check in the mail recently. Apperantly it wasnt enough for them to establish it. I dont know.  Thank you!
hm7mfyt,danger_close7,11/26/2021,1,That’s true. It’s been almost 20 years for me - the stipend we received was $300/month plus books and even back then that did not go very far. I also had a job while I was in school to pay living expenses.
hm769a0,Santa_Claus77,11/26/2021,1,You know I’m glad you asked because I did not think that far actually with everything else on my plate. I guess my plan was loans.   Personally I think I would like the tax break now. My concern is what do I do if:   I contribute to a Roth 401k now New job and I don’t have that option so I roll it over to my Roth IRA. Because Roth 401k isn’t an option I do traditional 401k at this hypothetical new job. My next job offers a Roth IRA as an option. Do I roll the traditional 401k into a traditional IRA and keep flip flopping back and forth?   I may be overcomplicating things. I’m sorry
hm899u2,anubis2018,11/26/2021,1,I return checks like that at my work. Youd be surprised what people can get away with. Mobile deposits have made fraud skyrocket. Between noone actually looking at the check before presenting it to the payee bank to people mobile depositing then taking it physically to a bank and double depositing the check.(the bank with the physical check gets the credit not the one with the mobile deposit  sso that bank always gets screwed in this situation) This shit is insane.
hm82m2o,jimspokane,11/26/2021,1,Uninsured motorist coverage is usually medical expenses only does nothing for property damage unless you elect the additional coverage

hm79e1u,greem,11/26/2021,1,Small claims is basically free. Even threatening small claims gets you your way.
hm7vfji,4and2,11/26/2021,1,If you contribute 8% they will contribute 4% but if you only contribute 6% then they only contribute 3%. Thats why they word it that their match depends on how much you contribute.
hm717dz,Lone_tumbleweed,11/26/2021,1,I need the 2k for the deposit fee and the first two months of rent! I am willing to get a second job but I won’t receive my first paycheck until a week before when I want to move in—granted I can get another job that fast.   After all my current expenses I have about 400 each check left to spare so 800 by the time I want to move in.
hm7pkm1,Ok-Meringue7413,11/26/2021,1,I have scrounged through my budget multiple times and short of canceling my gym membership I’ve scrapped everything I could.
hm7ecuq,Varathien,11/26/2021,1,Given your income you can afford the cars.   But do you really want to? When you spend money on one thing it means you cant spend it on anything else. Is there really nothing you can do with $180000 that will bring you more joy than two expensive cars?
hm8hahd,Greenappleflavor,11/26/2021,1,If it’s internal unfortunately not. As a former teller I can say they see everything. I would move the money out report it and I would also put a freeze on my credit with the three bureau. That teller has access to EVERYTHING (ssn ph address etc).

hm88z3g,Buttigieg2032,11/26/2021,1,You’re giving up free 100% return and no you can’t get this back any time.   He’s wrong.  I’m shocked people in here are agreeing with you.  You’re giving up 100% returns (+10% average market returns so 110%) to pay back student loans which are only 7% interest? It’s insane.   If you save more now you can save less in the future so even if you’re want to buy a house some day or whatever it still doesn’t make sense to not get the full match.  Also your dad should fire his financial advisor if that’s what he’s recommending.

They probably didnt wish they were dead but it doesnt look like fun once all your friends are dead and you cant remember that your kids are grown and married.
hm747jn,SecretExplorer355,11/26/2021,1,okay I’m heading to work soon. I’ll ask why my hours are so off.
hm87tqu,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,400 a month turns out to be 4800 invested a year.  Seems better to average in by spending 100 every Monday rather than dropping 3000 in at once.  Upon checking VTSAX is 235 and you said I have to buy a whole share so I guess buying one share a month and 3 VTIAX a month brings me to 400ish.  I wish I could just set it and forget it.  I’ll look and see if I can find a way to do 100 every week maybe under another ticker? I’m new to this stuff.   Thanks for those links I’m gonna read them.
hm73uuq,parkinsonblack,11/26/2021,1,This is great thanks for the help!
hm6yklk,throwaway_eng_fin,11/26/2021,2,True though its not at all hard to find a FA who will dump all your stuff into high priced funds or works exclusively with a place that charges 1% AUM.
hm6vsea,wrob,11/26/2021,-7,I dont think I would do anything really. As far as youre concerned the landlord lost the check that you sent them. Sounds like their problem. Send summarizing everything along with proof that the rent was sent so that you have a record of everything. Ask them to show you proof that they didnt receive the money and tell them to follow up with their bank to track it down.   Basically the burden of proof is on the landlord that they didnt just lose your check.   The landlord doesnt have a lot of recourse other than trying to evict you which you could pretty easily fight. Theyll probably try to withhold your deposit but there should be a resource to fight that also.   Im not saying to go pick and fight with them. And if they do try to evict you then that wont be fun if if youre in the right but also this isnt 100% on you. Make the landlord do some work. Theres a very good chance they just drop it if you convince them that they wouldnt win in a fight.
hm8nh2j,DeadScotty,11/26/2021,1,Chili’s sucks now. Their food quality is shit. I don’t go there anymore. They don’t pay a competitive wage these days either compared to the rest of the industry.

hm6sn09,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,2,One trick is to learn to self soothe so you can suffer during the delay part of delayed gratification.   Many not great things we do are really our way of getting a new feeling. Like some people go to bakery for a cupcake and others go to get a new feeling....  Anways start by making a list of 10 things you can do to self soothe. Prioritize the list. Keep a written copy and a digital one on your phone. When the impulse to veer off track becomes an urge get the list. Start at #1. Do it for 10 minutes. Reevaluate. Is it working? Then keep doing it! Not so much? Move on to #2. Rinse repeat until the feelings are manageable again. At a later date when things are good do an after action report so to speak. What worked? How well? What didnt.  If ut didnt work  toss it. Replace it with something new to try. Now reorder the list accordingly. Rinse repeat until you have not only a tried and true go to list but a habit.   A regular mantra is I can do hard things. Or I do hard things.   The key to successfully delaying gratification is being able to suffer better. The ability to self soothe and distraction is where the better part comes in.
hm7b0mu,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,3,I will let others reply with specifics.  But relax. Youll just file now. Penalties should be minimal (assuming you dont make a lot of money).
hm8g8mg,zhonzhon,11/26/2021,1,In general yes.  But it depends on contract specifics.  But they can also withdraw the offer.  Or you can quit before even starting.

hm78kee,GarfieldDaCat,11/26/2021,1,My 401k is a bit low because I didnt start contributing until recently as I wanted to completely pay off my student loans ASAP.   I am currently putting about 8% into retirement. A bit on the lower side but I want to be a bit riskier in terms of my investing since I am so young. (crypto)
hm7kj9j,Econ0mist,11/26/2021,1,OK so she wont be eligible for any Social Security spousal or survivor benefits. She should create an account at ssa.gov and plug the numbers into opensocialsecurity.com to understand her projected Social Security retirement benefits.   Getting a return on investments is important but because she has a relatively short time left to save its more important that she focus on saving as much as possible.   You might want to put together a simple spreadsheet that assumes a 4-5% rate of return (balanced portfolio) and shows how much saving $x per month turns into at age 70.  Also its possible that she will be better off with a Traditional IRA where she can take a tax deduction for contributing. If she will have no other income sources in retirement she can withdraw some of the pretax Traditional IRA money in the 0% tax bracket locking in the tax savings.  You also asked about investment allocation. I think any balanced fund or target retirement index fund is fine. She might also need to explore single premium immediate annuities (SPIA) later in life to obtain a higher payout than an investment portfolio can generate.
hm7k5oy,widowmaker28A,11/26/2021,1,Pay for it upfront. All college loans will suck you dry in the long run. Better to start a career after college in the black then 40K in the red.
hm6x9ew,doktorhladnjak,11/26/2021,2,This is actually exactly what they are looking for. Have to prove money being used to buy a home is not being laundered from a sanctioned or criminal source.  It’s in addition to making sure you’re not borrowing the down payment though too
hm82kcy,redapoluza,11/26/2021,1,I honestly have no idea with the rust. It didnt notice it as abnormal until a few months into the purchase unfortunately. But Ive had several trips to the mechanic for crap just falling off while im driving. Today i had them do a full inspection and had them show me about 3k worth of stuff that is the process of failure.   He said its rare to see it get so bad that early but it happens. I live in the midwest & rust is kinda just a way of life down here. Probably gonna look into treating my next vehicle for it.   I am thinking of just trading it in but unless i find a great offer somewhere im looking at a 4-5k loss. Thats without doing repairs. Would 3k of repairs give me more than 3k in extra trade in? Im doubting it. But yea i am kindof shot of the thing.
hm79exk,krone-icals,11/26/2021,1,Is it worth it then to file with CFPB or am I just wasting more of my time at this point and should just drop it
hm8fag0,pfinancelurker,11/26/2021,1,No one here is going to fight you on consistently buying VTI. You can add international exposure if you want but you don’t necessarily ever need to do anything other than that.
hm7gphh,wlee233,11/26/2021,1,but you need to determine whether they pay out the match each pay period or pay out the match as a lump sum based on your total contributed throughout the year. if they pay as a lump sum you could set your contribution to the highest allowable by the plan like 70% for example just to make sure you contribute enough before year end to receive the full match
hm7fx3r,Super_Slide_3555,11/26/2021,1,This! I don’t understand why this isn’t the ONLY response on the thread.   You could put it all in a cash account in your 401k and call it your emergency stash and it’s still the dominate strategy   *With the assumption company match vests right away*
hm7123y,reddititty69,11/26/2021,1,Sounds like the current offer is a no go then. That’s fine things change.  It’s not like you’re withdrawing on a whim.  Tell them about the whole LTI and what they could do to ensure you come onboard.  It puts the ball in their court.  Also figure into your calculations if the new company does t have an LTI program.  Your current company may be the better long term bet.
hm8k4xt,OnlyPostSoUsersXray,11/26/2021,1,Thats insane. Personal contact outside of the financial institution is a huge no no. They will likely be fired rightfully so.  Quick story time:  I was fooling around with a girl she was married but claimed they were separated and just living together as roommates (I was young and naive forgive me). Well eventually the husband found out drama all that. The next day I learned that he was a financial advisor at the bank where I had all my business accounts at. I was worried he would mess with my accounts.  Out of an abundance of caution I contacted my local branch manager she was very understanding and said their had been no inquires into my account by him or anyone else but she would make a note and check periodically.  Got a call a few days later from her saying that the case had been forwarded to their internal (fraud?) department or whoever handles internal affairs like that. Turns out dude had looked into my accounts (but didnt move or take money).  Either way he was immediately fired and probably blacklisted in some way from working in the industry cause last I heard he was working as a bartender.
hm8mlqe,Immediate-Joke8605,11/26/2021,1,Ok.. so how come IRA account generate capital gain? Is that like mutual fund? Can I choose fund by depositing money or does bank choose for me?  Or stepping back.. is that just checking account? I’m sorry for ignorance
hm8fmmx,Sarkir,11/26/2021,1,Notify the bank of the employee’s behavior. If the employee steals from your account the bank will be responsible for the theft and replace the funds. I think at most you have to worry about inconvenience. In most systems it would be nearly impossible for a teller to get away with stealing from a random customer account especially if you are looking after the account.
hm7hgau,interstat,11/26/2021,1,Yea for sure.  Weve been fortunate to be living mostly in the rural areas of USA. Cost of living is so much lower than my family living back in japan  Having a job that paid for all meals a 150 dollar a month room rent in bumble fuck Tennessee set us up good for the future. If I was spending 3400 for an apartment in Tokyo like my brother was Id have had zero savings

hm7tbsf,HolyGig,11/26/2021,1,There is a point in life where you go from thinking money is the most important asset to realize that time is your most important asset. In a lot of ways they are even the same thing but while you can trade time for money you can never trade money for more time no matter how rich you are.  You cant really be saving too much unless you are letting it impact or be detrimental to your current lifestyle. Saving is good but dont get addicted to it and make sure you are spending some money now to enjoy your life.
hm8dxtp,Fresh-Lynx-3564,11/26/2021,1,I would move my $ to another bank first and than report and show the screenshot. Just to be safe. It’s much harder to get $ back even with evidence. And hopefully the bank do better compliance training with their employees.
hm7iasu,DetN8,11/26/2021,1,Its not withdrawn until the check is cashed. If its very important to someone to not incur late fees they should write the check hand it to the landlord and request receipt of payment doing so well before its due.
hm7e6z2,lstac936,11/26/2021,1,Thanks I never knew that.
hm7bhx6,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,1,> terms and conditions of the credit card will give you the answer on liability  This statement implies there is a credit card out there where the AU is liable for charges.  Would you mind educating the rest of us are unaware of the existence of such terms and conditions with an example?
hm7sw7v,TodaysMenace,11/26/2021,1,You very well may wake up tomorrow suffering from whiplash. Definitely contact their insurance!
hm8cfae,tdp5150,11/26/2021,1,That’s stretching it a bit for sure. Good rule of thumb is shoot for a mortgage balance of no more than 3x your income anything beyond that starts to get iffy (but not impossible). Particularly because you don’t have all that much cash saved up in case SHTF.

hm6u2dc,colty31,11/26/2021,4,You need to have this conversation with your insurance company. Your car was probably worth $27-$30K so you’re correct that the $20K estimate means it’s not totaled.  I would be very uncomfortable having that much work done on a car what exactly was damaged? Is it just cosmetic stuff? Engine? Axels?
hm6wfzg,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,So what is your goal? To avoid MI taxes? Or just pay the minimum?
hm8h3uw,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,I mean Ive added hundreds of drivers to policies and seen the rates go down.  Personally I have never seen a policy go up when there were more drivers then vehicles and the added driver had no activity and was in a lower risk sex/age group.    Generally speaking cars are rated for not drivers.  But the rate for the car is modified by the driver/drivers assigned to it.  If multiple drivers are assigned to the car either the more expensive driver is rated for or the modifier is split between the drivers.  So you either pay for the more expensive driver or the average or the two drivers.  Meaning that you can add a lower risk driver and not increase the rates as long as you have more cars then drivers.  I have also seen rates go up.  But every time the rate went up it was either a higher risk driver or there were not more drivers then cars on the policy.  There may be insurance companies out there that do not follow this general rule I can only explain how it generally works.
hm83qnu,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,Yes it most definitely does factor into capital gains tax. If you sell an item for more then you paid for it the gains are taxable.
hm8flsr,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,Yes but in this case the car was sold for less then market value by their parents.  That would be considered a gift of equity.  So capital gains tax would be based on the value of the car when OP got it minus the sales price.  Most likely they did not make a profit as far as the IRS is concerned since most cars lose value over time.
hm84z38,PutinBoomedMe,11/26/2021,1,There is. I consider myself highly educated but I didnt know a child could defer their 10 year period until they become 18. Even more reason for OP to roll to the inherited IRA and push it off until later
hm7qktb,iAmTheMadIrishMan,11/26/2021,1,Now isn’t a good time to buy IMO. You are pretty spot on with your price range. Which is is inflated above the 6% inflation rates we’ve seen across the board. If you do new is the way to go. If you have to buy that price is about the same for a brand new Camry over here in California.
hm7eke7,LyricalPig,11/26/2021,1,because thanks to interest you pay half your loan in the first 4/6 years of a loan
hm79d8c,Speakesy,11/26/2021,3,Gambling. Deposits into betting accounts. Links to known forms of gambling indicate huge red flags for lenders.
hm8adjg,djfolo,11/26/2021,1,Someone else kinda already said it. Keep a maintenance fund and emergency fund specifically for your home. Whether its old or new you have no idea what kind of stuff can happen that youll be on the hook for... regardless of whether you have a home warranty or not. Ive had home warranty companies come up with loop holes or excuses why things wouldnt be covered insurance companies have clauses for all kinds of stuff etc...   Actually do routine maintenance clean your gutters make sure no water pools anywhere near your home when it rains. Put hair traps in all drains or atleast baths or showers. Change your central air filters routinely. Make sure you have a humidity sensor somewhere in your home most newer thermostats have them. Too much humidity can be a sign of a hidden leak think about checking for mold. Theres so much man. But its worth it to do these things and keep track it can save you 10s of thousands of dollars in the long run.   Insurance doesnt cover things that break or fail due to lack of maintenance. For example if your foundation cracks because you had too much water pooling around a wall it likely wont be covered. You should have seen that and installed a French drain or made sure your gutters were properly installed. It sounds like basic stuff but man so many people dont do the little stuff and it causes very real an expensive problems.
hm761u2,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,1,Pay a family law lawyer for an hour or two of their time to explain to you all of the ramifications and if this can be written in (and enforced if need be) into the property settlement of your divorce. Plus ask the underwriter if having a legal separation in place makes a difference?   And maybe shop around for cash out refi loans with different underwriting.
hm8chvc,RainBowSkittlz,11/26/2021,1,I think its possible he does my mom told me a story about how in the 80s there was someone using her account fraudulently turned out to be a bank employee...its probably a lot safer now but thats shady af and I would probably contact your bank and let them know what happened make sure you save the message or at least screenshot it
hm8md3r,Stroinsk,11/26/2021,1,So if you are physically able Id seriously consider the military. If youre smart its an almost guaranteed ticket to the middle class. Most importantly the day you ship out your parents will NEVER hold any power over you again.   Plenty of people get a degree when theyre in and plenty more use the GI bill when they get out. You will save yourself the pain of of crippling student loans. VA backed mortgage makes home ownership way more accessible than the average American.   If youre lucky or can afford to wait for a spot you can even just get trained in a very valuable skillet anyway and not even need further school. Think air traffic controller nuke power or IT. All jobs you can make 6 figures by your 30s.
hm7wv4m,RealAfricanPrince,11/26/2021,1,Rule #1 is Always take the free money. Your salary should be reasonably sufficient to quickly build a safety net or rapidly pay down debt at the same time as maxing your 401k. The time value of money is incredibly powerful when you are youngest and worth delaying other financial goals and certainly material goods (cars shopping etc)
hm8kifi,asks_mrtgg_questions,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for sharing! I think my main problem right now is lack of available cash. I would have a very reliable tenant - my good friend who Ive known >10 years and is also a 6 figure earner. However I imagine he will also want to purchase his own place sometime in the near future so I dont want to count on that long term. I was thinking I could swing it still like you said but it may get uncomfortable at times. I guess it just depends on how risk averse I want to be.
hm6y3xi,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,4,He has to pay it back by the income tax *return* due date (+extension) of whichever year he left the job.

Hopefully something on this thread will help you get some answers at the very least.
hm78ycq,Mr_Ted_Stickle,11/26/2021,15,Yeah man i second this. You aren’t obligated to go anywhere or do anything until you hop on that bus to go to boot camp. If your recruiter says a specific job isn’t available then tell your recruiter that you’ll wait until it is. Don’t sign any thing until you have things in writing.  edit: get familiar with the military benefits and the system overall. You can make it work in your favor if you stick to a plan.
hm811ht,somedudeinlosangeles,11/26/2021,1,Another reason why you should be balancing your accounts monthly.  There’s a reason ALL financial institutions send you monthly statements.    Folks learn to balance your accounts.
hm7714w,Sinsyxx,11/26/2021,1,Your da is actually right in a sense. From a financial planning perspective you shouldn’t be investing until you have an emergency savings fund. That said the best option is to up your contribution to match and increase your savings at the same time. You’re young and with a good income should be able to do both. Don’t worry about the student loans.
hm7zvt3,NationalReturn8,11/26/2021,1,So me using my debit card doesn’t change anything right? Also I appreciate your answer. I was afraid that maybe the company would try to take action against me. Then again no matter how many times I reach out to them I’ve gotten no where.

hm7t8h2,Roxerz,11/26/2021,1,I cant say Army from experience but I did 4 years in the USAF. Best decision of my life. Did it in 2009 towards the end of the housing crisis and was 23 at the time failing community College with $13k+ debt. I ended up as a contract specialist (6C0) and they offered me a $90k reenlistment bonus. I didnt take it as I wanted to go be a full time poker pro. Family asked me to finish college and I did using post 9/11 GI bill. Veteran preference along with good grades a bunch of recommendation letters from commanders and professors got me my first job out of college. I now work for the govt where my military time can be transferred towards retirement and am on track to be GS-13 making 6 figures (I already do with other passive income). If I didnt go to the military my life wouldnt have accelerated as fast as it did. I was always better and brighter than most people but I was poor and wasnt raised with any guidance so I never got to see my full potential. I could do so much more than I do now but Im happy with my job and family.  Of course I know some army guys who hate the military after they get out. Everyone is different and all branches are tougher in culture than the AF but the AF gave me the tools and guidance to get to where I am now. I seriously couldve gone down a dark path. Poverty and bad neighborhoods will guide you into desperate situations. A lot of my friends were drug users and dealers.
hm8aw5l,fredinNH,11/26/2021,1,You are right I was wrong. I had to call Toyota credit about my loan and I mentioned that I didn’t know Toyota was involved with Mazda. The rep I talked to said Toyota owned Mazda. She was wrong and I repeated her wrong.

hm8lee3,trmoore87,11/26/2021,1,I was planning on just contributing a certain amount to our trad 401k to drop us out of the 24% bracket and then putting anything else we can towards Roth 401k
hm766uu,metaverse-emperor,11/26/2021,18,Yeah I think I get where my dad’s coming from since I live in an expensive city and my monthly costs (rent groceries fun etc - I don’t have a car tho) are about $3K per month so only $1500 saved up with $15K left on student loans with 0% interest currently until Feb 1 = get a little extra money in the next few months in sacrifice for having more later and then push it up to 6% ASAP. Confusing situation though since rule of thumb and reception is overwhelmingly to meet the company’s half-match at 6%. My parents are well-off and I feel comfortable with them as a safety net so I don’t see the “free money” I’ll be making from now until I change it as something of a huge difference-maker but maybe I’m thinking about this wrong. That seems to be the case based on the comments so I’ll likely look to meet the half-match as soon as I can
hm7t4xk,NotOliverQueen,11/26/2021,1,Not in the army you are guaranteed the MOS you choose. If you dont like it dont sign the contract. However if you go to AIT (MOS training) and fail you are then subject to the needs of the army.  That being said theres not always slots available for the things you want and recruiters will always push you to sign anyway to fill quotas. Do not listen. Wait for something good.
hm7jl5x,Turing45,11/26/2021,6,This is the best answer. We just had a similar situation with one of the residents of a property I took over in August. I was tasked with going through all the accounts and making sure they were zeroed out meaning they didnt owe or have a credit. It was a huge task on a large property in the time of covid and the initial survey found more than a few that were shown as owing because the last managers were terrible. One lady showed owing a full months rent when her ledger showed she consistently had paid for several years.   I sent her a notice of balance due and instead of freaking out and coming in and screaming at me she asked me to let her know what month was missing. We went through her records carefully with her and she contacted her bank. It took several weeks to get it resolved but we discovered that her bank and debited her account but had never sent a months rent in August. We got it all cleared up and thanked her for her cooperation.   Another woman I sent a notice to came in cussing yelling and accusing me of stealing her money and being a Crooked ass Honky motherfucker among the nicer things she called me. She refused to even try to cooperate and instead said she was getting a lawyer and suing me the company and anyone else she could sue for taking her money. Her payment history was erratic at best but she didnt owe a full months rent just a half.   Turns out her boyfriend had never paid his part of the rent for July. She never apologized but she did get a notice of violation for her behavior.  I always tell people when you start yelling and cussing you have already lost. Keep your cool and ask the right questions.
hm8cdsp,rawbumhole,11/26/2021,1,Notify your bank straight away. Take screenshots. I’d also feel like my trust and privacy and been breached.
hm7fjvu,rnelsonee,11/26/2021,1,>will 1.5 months of 401k make it much more complicated or is it just a couple extra clicks?  Its literally one click into the one of the box 13 checkboxes (Retirement plan) and hit 4 or 5 digits however much it says on the W-2 that you contributed for box 12a. 401ks are completely transparent to taxes in a way: its not more complicated as your employer already accounts for it in your wages. Like someone who makes $70k/yr but puts $10k to a 401k then $60k in box 1 so the IRS just figures you make $60k. The only reason (I think) they even ask for your contribution is to ensure its less than the annual limit.  > employer matches 100% of contributions up to 3%and 50% match up to 5%  Contribute! Why are you working for less than what they are willing to pay you!? So your compensation is $104000/yr. Oh no thanks $100000 fine....
hm7lwxx,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,Sounds like you need to grow up and get things together. It might come off as rude but your an adult. I get being in a foreign county complicates things but if your volunteering and have limited income your taxes should be really easy. 1 hour of internet access and a free tax software program doesnt seem too much to ask.   The IRS has a tool on their website you can use to figure out what you need to do. Make sure to stay on top of things going forward. Life is hard enough dont make things harder for yourself by ignoring taxes.
hm6tcr4,incoming_fusillade,11/26/2021,2,Go with the coast guard or the navy. Theyre basically the same - but the navy has better jobs and the coast guard has a better quality of life.  In the navy jobs are called rates and theres a famous saying choose your rate choose your fate pick the right job and youll have no problems getting a job when you get out. Also be prepared to enlist an extra 2 years for schools that have longer schools.  Read military sub reddits for more info people will be sure to help you out.

hm7pcni,Romex80,11/26/2021,1,Actual estimate is $209000. Building costs in my area are not the cheapest currently.  However  my estimate was intended to be high as I will be doing several parts of the build myself.  I also factored in about $20000 for cushion. I have been in construction for a long time and something always comes up. If the build comes in a lot lower (still done at a good quality) then I guess I pay down a bunch of principal? Treading unknown trails here.  I have 2 trains of thought. Thought 1 - it is only 900 square feet in addition.  It cannot be that bad. Thought 2 - oh crap costs have skyrocketed again. I am hoping to fall somewhere in the middle.  Edit - the house has been in the family since 1962 and it is central to literally everything.  So we are building with the intent to stay till the eventual end as it were.

hm7gera,neuRoeeL,11/26/2021,1,Speaking as someone with a direct family history of schizophrenia/BPD I definitely understand that it can possibly be not just a want but a need to get out and away.   Youve done well to save up what you have so far but operating at a net loss (if you were to move out to a 1300/month apartment) based on your current paycheck is just a short-term bandaid. You should also consider that tenant eligibility for many/most apartment complexes includes an income requirement of 3x the rent.  Id recommend looking for a roommate or alternative housing option to lower the estimated 1300/month living cost so that you could still feasibly live on the 1600/month paycheck let alone continue to add to your savings. The stability of your own health is a critical consideration in your decision. If you wont be sacrificing too much of your physical or mental health by adding a second job then its a feasible option. If you have extended family/friends that would let you stay with them even for a little bit thats also a worthwhile short-term option until you can figure things out.
hm8kguj,wasted12,11/26/2021,1,Do you often pay for your gifts?
hm6z53a,nouseforanametoday,11/26/2021,2,No heat would condemn the house.
hm81nu2,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,Op I feel like Ive entered the twilight zone here with 3 of you saying the tax credit is better. For 2021 yeah. But 2022 reverts back to the fsa being better. You can save 19.35% plus state taxes on 5k with the fsa and  20% on only 3k with the tax credit.
hm8alcd,ravenwillowofbimbery,11/26/2021,1,My dad did and said something similar over 45/50 years ago.  Before I was born during the Vietnam era when folks were getting drafted my dad was a spoiled only child who was flunking out of community college.  He joined the Air Force in order to avoid being drafted.  He said it was the best thing he ever did.  The military taught him discipline and useful skills and allowed him to see the world while at a safe distance from war.  He was a life long aviation enthusiast and he became a jet engine mechanic while in the Air Force.  He was stationed several places stateside and abroad.  He loved his time in England (met life long friends) and Tripoli Libya. He bought his first car a VW Bug while stationed in Europe.  He had it shipped back home when he left.    When he was discharged he used his training to work at Pratt and Whitney (aerospace firm) while he returned to school using the GI Bill.  He earned a BS in Business Administration and worked in various HR capacities before eventually becoming the director of HR and Risk Management for two hospitals.    While my brother and I were young he joined the Army Reserves and led a group of reservists as a sergeant for about 17 years. He loved it and my brother and I sometimes tagged along with him on the weekends while he fulfilled his army reserve duties (he had a desk job).  We especially loved when he would return from summer camp with MREs.  The dried fruit and tiny chiclets were my favorites.  His time served during active duty and as a reservist allowed him to “retire” with full military benefits.  Things only got dicy for him and our family was when his unit was out on notice during the Gulf War.  My brother and I were terrified but thankfully he was never deployed.  After he died and I was going through his papers I saw where he had to draft a will designate beneficiaries etc.  it was then that it dawned on me just how close he was to deploying.    Anyway I went down memory lane to communicate my dad’s story to OP and echo what others have said.  The military and specifically the Air Force can be a good thing if used strategically.  My dad was proud of his military service and always spoke highly of the positive impact that the US military had on his life and I was always proud of my dad both in and out of uniform.  RIP daddy a big thanks to all of you have and continue to serve and best wishes to OP.   P.S. the military had such a profound impact on my dad that the man starched his pants until the day he died. He even starched his jeans! 😊
hm8k4bh,YamEducational1515,11/26/2021,1,Make a spreadsheet. LOL Get a second job and stop giving out trash life advice on Reddit.
hm76a1x,MathandMarketsCFA,11/26/2021,6,As a thought experiment so you understand it everyone has already pointed out it is bad advice. You could simply contribute 6% instead of the 4% you are. You could then immediately sell the extra 3% (2% + 1% match) in your 401k from contributing the 2% and even with 10% penalty youd have more cash on hand  Edit: Just so were clear dont do this. Just pointing out you have a dominant strategy compared to what your father mentioned. The best though is to contribute and not sell immediately.
hm6x3h9,personalfinanceta5,11/26/2021,1,Why do you recommend that over nicer furniture? Just the best value/price point?  I do need folding chairs for dining table so will def consider this.
hm8k42o,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,Not really but ok.
hm7vw2w,k_lena,11/26/2021,1,I’ve only ever sold a car to carmax but they were very helpful and offered to help me navigate the loan payoff if I needed. I imagine they’d do the same especially if you were interested in replacing the ram with something from their lot.   You could shop around ahead of time to see if you could qualify for an auto loan through your bank or credit union.  They may even offer cash out refinance for your ram to cover the repairs needed if you want to keep it after it’s fixed.
hm84hbt,hopingtothrive,11/26/2021,1,Dial with your insurance company. Its unlikely the offender will be found. No one can prove they were drunk. It doesnt matter anyway. This is what your insurance is for -- to cover you under all circumstances.
hm85q8g,wanttostayhidden,11/26/2021,1,If no one is depending on your income for support you do not need life insurance. Also since you have a 401k you make too much to deduct a traditional IRA so you would want to look into a backdoor Roth IRA.
hm76jum,EatYourCheckers,11/26/2021,1,Is 10k within your annual limits to invest in a Roth IRA? Or maybe you mean for both you and your spouse combined?  I would suggest college fund if you want a place to save money where its actually growing and not just in a savings account I use Vangaurds Admiral Shares mutual fund you can invest through Fidelity with it even though its a Vanguard fund.
hm8l7z5,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,Mmmm that’s funny. From the IRS website   >The gift tax is a tax on the transfer of property by one individual to another while receiving nothing or less than full value
hm8cgjy,planefan001,11/26/2021,1,Zelle usually gives you a list of their partner banks when you download the app and sign up. BoA is probably supported. Not sure about Ally.
hm7tr2t,Hover4effect,11/26/2021,1,I know a bunch of other Army pilots that got full time gigs with major airlines regional carriers life flight (helicopter medevac) etc. Might take a longer commitment but they totally do street to seat where you join the Army to be a helicopter pilot. The recruiters will tell you it isnt possible but I went through warrant officer school and flight school with a few.  Captains at major airlines make 200k+.
hm7s7t8,thedukejck,11/26/2021,1,The golden ticket is the honorable discharge.  Ask yourself that in your worst moment cold heat etc.  if someone told you to do something could you?  Then yes well worth it!
hm6xa4z,cahphoenix,11/26/2021,2,No they (almost 100%) did not. All clearance costs are paid by government agencies with appropriated funds. I cant remember the statistics but well over 99% of all clearances are paid this way.  I will concede that my never was incorrect...as it does seem that a very small percentage are paid for in some other way. How those are paid and what they are for...I have no idea.  [https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs](https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs)  &#x200B  >**How much does it cost to get a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL)?**   >   >With very limited exceptions there is no direct charge to federal contractors for a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL). Government agencies receive appropriated funds to cover the cost of adjudicating security clearances and to pay an Investigation Service Provider like DCSA/NBIB for security clearance investigations. DCSA receives appropriated funds to pay for federal contractor clearance investigations and adjudications under the NISP. DCSA also receives appropriated funds to pay for security clearance adjudication for the military service departments and other DoD agencies.  Edit: Note this is just one source there are plenty of others stating the same.  The cost incurred by the contractor is likely the cost of managing the process on their side.
hm6y3cm,jesseserious,11/26/2021,16,I could see this being viable if his objective is to get you stable and debt free asap.  As a parent his rationale is probably that hed rather his kid be in the safe zone than having you put away a few extra dollars that you wont see for another 4 decades.  Especially if losing your job would mean you need need his financial support again.  If you already feel pretty stable and can build an emergency fund then go for the full match.  Its 100% the best long term move.
hm7u555,iAmTheMadIrishMan,11/26/2021,1,It’s still about 28k. Just vehicle inflation has outpaced inflation in general.
hm6sqbq,Majestic_Ferrett,11/26/2021,1,At 300% interest no doubt.
hm71on3,Zango_,11/26/2021,1,I dont see how its on his landlord to figure out... If you own a business and someone says well I sent the check in the mail not my problem youd sure as hell cut ties with that person on any future business...
hm7k9x4,ResultNo3300,11/26/2021,1,It happened in April. There was an unauthorized transaction on 4/6 from my Citibank checking account to PayPal Add Money. Then I filed claim with Citibank right after. Citibank said it was fine and didn’t need to close the account. But there were three more unauthorized transactions after 4/6 which caused my Citibank checking account overdrawn by $3200. I filed claims again and again for three times. Citibank’s answer is these transactions were authorized as payee from my Citibank checking account through mobile APP. I told Citibank that I didn’t have APP at all. I sent my phone IP address and my computer IP address. But still Citibank denied my claims.
hm8jruh,OneTwoPunchDrunk,11/26/2021,1,Yikes. I would feel extremely uncomfortable as well. Bummer for the guy that hes desperate but he could be desperate and all you for advice on how to cultivate wealth on your next visit vs. Hey stranger found your Facebook you know since I have your full name and info from my job can I have some money? Just wow. I would be on the horn to the bank straight away.
hm8glj7,Fragrant-Dust,11/26/2021,1,financing is better and essentially a money maker given that inflation is like 6% right now. the real interest rate would be negative. this means theyre essentially paying you to take the loan
hm7ngpw,levans1717,11/26/2021,1,If Dave Ramsay were here he would tell you that you should start with $1000 emergency fund which you already have. Then work on paying off debts that you have other than mortgage if you have one. Then work on an emergency fund for 3-6 months of living expenses. THEN go hard with 15% saving into 401k. He would say stop contributing completely and pay off debts beforehand because your debt interest will eat you alive.  Edit: Also your co-workers and cousin in HR won’t care about or know as much about your situation as your father. In my opinion your Father’s financial advisor probably has some better advice than that of a cousin in HR.
hm7nilg,Default87,11/26/2021,13,considering how the 24% MFJ tax brackets for 2021 dont start until about ~$173k of taxable income and you make a combined $206k before deductions and retirement savings no you are not paying $50k in federal income tax each year.  you are not doing your math correctly or you have not provided accurate data in your post.
hm7ojm5,BeardedMan32,11/26/2021,1,One is pushed the other is pulled. Chase is sending a check and withdrawing funds before payment is received Verizon is giving you credit when you authorize even though it takes them a few days to pull it out. If you sent your Verizon payment through your bank’s website it would come out immediately but not be received for a few days. Not sure which is more preferable.
hm8j63k,CyberSecurityGuy1,11/26/2021,1,Good point.
hm75clu,bb0110,11/26/2021,3,The difference isn’t comparable to interest rate. It would be comparing 50% return + whatever it appreciates compared to the interest rate of the student loan let’s cal that 6%. It’s a no brainer when comparing to student loan payments.
hm84mg7,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,No you are not. You are taxed on the difference between your basis and what you sell it for. And yes this is exactly what capital gains are.
hm8gnvw,tacotruck2112,11/26/2021,1,>My 401(k) plan offers allows for in-service rollovers any age any source.  You may want to check on that.  You may be able to do this with match and other employer contributions but probably not on 401k elective deferrals (pre-tax and/or Roth)  before age 59.5.  This is a regulatory issue not a plan-specific item.
hm84cdb,jimspokane,11/26/2021,1,It comes in two parts one for Medical one for physical damage.  You have to be sure to elect both parts at least in the states I am familiar with.
hm8662e,tofulo,11/26/2021,1,Wait cant you make a roth ira regardless?
hm6vxpn,vynm2,11/26/2021,2,You may already understand withholding by now but its basically pre-payment of what youll owe when you file your tax return. Withholding on your regular W-2 income is an estimate based on the amount of your paychecks and the info you provided to your employer on your W-4 form and withholding on your bonus is done assuming that your bonus will fall in the 22% tax bracket (hence the 22% rate).
hm7o9wq,shadow1515,11/26/2021,1,I figured it was something like that. Setting it up with Verizon directly is non-negotiable because it triggers a discount on the bill. Its just annoying from a personal accounting perspective.
hm8i0u6,CyberSecurityGuy1,11/26/2021,1,I think the difference is that Robinhood wanted SIPC to cover their checking and savings accounts but the SIPC had an issue because (from some random news article) Brokerage firms often offer accounts for customers to hold cash until it can be invested in securities but those accounts arent meant to be strictly for savings Harbeck said. Money sitting in such accounts but not intended to buy securities may not be covered by the SIPC which insures accounts for up to $250000 of cash in the case of a brokers failure.  With Fair they pool everyones money together and dump it in stocks and they give you up to 4%. Fair will eat any loss and not pass it on to the customer. Worst case scenario you might not get 4% one month but your principle balance will never go down.  And on the flip side if they use your money and make 10% off it it they will give you 4% and they keep the rest as profit.
hm8i7jo,Birdy_Cephon_Altera,11/26/2021,1,Banker dude here.  Better to report to corporate because if its just reported to the manager at the branch the manager can very easily cover it up and do nothing - if the manager and the employee are in-cahoots.        Most big banks have an ethics hotline or similar type of number that can be called to report violations like this.
hm791hb,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,2,> Is there a way to get the IRA money without taxes to renovate?  Make so little money that the entire IRA withdrawal is inside your standard deduction.  > I also just sold an investment property and hear will need to pay capital gains tax. Is there a way to move the profit elsewhere without having to pay the tax?  Section 1031 Exchange
hm8hlti,RubyRidgebackmomma,11/26/2021,1,I didn’t suggest fraud and neglecting/forgetting to tell them does not equate fraud. Go find someone else to argue with I’m done. You know it all anyway.
hm7jg2r,Zphr,11/26/2021,1,If your saving rate is causing you to not enjoy life now then yes its too much.  If you are saving so much that youre going to have way more money than youll ever need in retirement then yes its too much.  This one can be somewhat eliminated if you have kids or a charity that you want to leave a lot of money to.  Dying with $4M in the bank isnt wasteful provided you have something useful to direct it to and that saving that amount didnt cause you to lively unhappily.  Other than that youre good at least in terms of worrying about saving way too much.  It might be that you could cut back on saving and spend more but if youre not going to get additional enjoyment out of doing so then it doesnt really make much sense either way.  Spend pointlessly within your means for today versus saving pointlessly within your means for tomorrow.  Neither is great but neither is going to hurt you much if your current spending and future saving are already good enough.  The real problem with oversaving or overspending is that people are often poor judges of what actually makes them happy.  Take the time to really think about if you are truly happy with your current setup and future plans.  If youre not then its time to make some adjustments.
hm8jmgo,Annahsbananas,11/26/2021,1,No no no. Op please dont listen to this. This is not good advice  1. Do not engage with the bank teller 2. Take screenshots of his message 3. Go to the bank in Monday and speak with the branch manager. Get everything in writing
hm6tanl,dwiggs30,11/26/2021,1,Given where you are now financially and the path you’re about to be on this is the time to search for and choose a financial planner. They’ll help you work through setting and planning goals and determine where to put your money for maximum effectiveness.
hm8npxv,SeattleSushiGirl,11/26/2021,1,As a former bank teller myself for one of the large banks I can also confirm this is a breach of privacy. Absolutely screenshot this and call the branch manager asap. This may not be the first time hes done this and it may not be his last.
hm7xf0n,Flakmaster92,11/26/2021,1,Yes. Small numbers to keep the math easy…   If you have 1000 invested and it goes up by 10% you now have 1100. You withdraw 5% ($55) to live on you now have 1045. Next year it goes up by another 10% you now have 1155. Withdraw 5% you now have 1092.   As long as you withdraw less in a given year than you made in returns your net worth will actually scale upwards even after you retire.   Now if the market drops in a given year then you need to withdraw 5% (or less the actual recommendation is 3.5-4%) of the new lower number meaning that you will have less money to spend this year than in previous years.

hm7882f,erotictravel,11/26/2021,1,The executor is required to notify  the bank of the death and close the account.    Deliberately keeping the account open for personal gain if by definition fraud. Not only is the executor opening themselves up to criminal charges so are any of the authorized users who use the account after they know of the death of the account holder.
hm8ovxf,GaylrdFocker,11/26/2021,2,Were there any transactions prior to the 24th that werent included in your statement? If it was pending it may not be added to the statement but will show the date after its finalized.
hm80cp4,Mountain_Pen_1615,11/26/2021,1,What insurance do you have?
hm7rj5x,CQME,11/26/2021,1,The following sub is fantastic for retirement questions /r/financialindependence    >what should the asset allocation look like?  Hmmm...standard advice would probably be target date plan so for her [probably a 2035 fund.](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315792655)  Looking at that funds distribution they are still heavy in equities but they will transition to bonds as 2035 gets closer.  I know the sub I referenced above has a tool called FIREcalc that recommends going 100% S&P 500 but given your moms time horizon this may be riskier than for most people.  Id go to that forum and ask them what to do as well.  Im very pessimistic about current market conditions and think nearly everything is in a bubble but unfortunately I dont have any sound advice as to where to invest to protect against such a bubble bursting [other than short term government securities or TIPS.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/091504.asp)  She can hold TIPS for the long term they are designed to weather any storm.  There is some volatility so it is not perfect but generally speaking most people recognize this investment as one of the most risk-free investments out there.  The main ETF for TIPS is well TIP lol.

hm6xep8,OutsideAllDay,11/26/2021,1,That’s where tone is important. You don’t want to do it. But they need to fix it. Tone and being firm but not confrontational solves this. Hospitals are usually big organizations and they should be embarrassed as hell that this is happening. They also don’t really promote or give raises arbitrarily to nurses in my experience.   Many states have rules about how quickly this has to be fixed. They may be past the timeframe to do so. Retaliation is a huge deal. Be kind and understanding but firm until you can’t be.
hm77xuq,Drill1,11/26/2021,1,Thanks.  I did have an accountant and pretty much just did as she suggested.     Sounds like you have a good plan in place.
hm7gm6n,OnlyPostSoUsersXray,11/26/2021,1,No doubt! I just didnt know but now I have a better idea.  Just finished enrollment.
hm6udrn,PaulR504,11/26/2021,2,hmmmmz 2% missed out match vs interest on the student loan? Interesting question.  If the student loan is low interest I would take the tax free match but if it is one of those 7% deals then I could see his logic here.  The problem is student loans count as debt when you go to buy a house.
hm7g5gw,MinutePianist4350,11/26/2021,1,Not since the late 70’s or early 80’s. The social security act used to have a provision that would continue auxiliary benefits for a child beyond high school as long as the child was in full time attendance at a college or university. Congress amended the Act and ceased these payments.
hm74u0g,ki4fkw,11/26/2021,1,It’s true that many degrees don’t break you straight in to a desirable job. Each path is different but again you have to put the work in.   Sometimes it takes starting in the mailroom to build commonalities in relationships to get a break even with that degree.  Nothing wrong with bartending or any other job especially as a means to support yourself while figuring things out. Where people fail is resigning themselves to it forever because jobs don’t present themselves.
hm7cvo6,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,1,Dont let fear/anxiety about nonexistent work prevent you from saving for retirement.
hm8k0rn,TwoWrongsAreSoRight,11/26/2021,1,Yeah your points are valid.  Guess it depends on how passive OP wants to be.  The very least OP should do is move to another bank.  Hypothetical question though.  Say this guy embezzled a bunch of money from different accounts then quit.  How would the bank respond?  Guess it depends on their policies but would OP be made whole as soon as it was discovered or would they make him jump through a bunch of hoops and wait till there is a conviction before being forced to?
hm7g8tn,Brandon432,11/26/2021,1,Did the money come out of your account? If not then pay your landlord. If so have Chase put a stop payment on the check and replace the funds. Then pay your landlord.
hm86oaf,QuitProfessional5437,11/26/2021,1,Also opening a checking account is free. Not sure why they are charging you 25?
hm74m8q,insquestaca,11/26/2021,2,Yes it does not look good.  I see a future of promised overtime being worked and not being paid out.
hm6t50t,lunlope,11/26/2021,7,1. You probably have to stay at parents home until you are fully recovered and get a full time job. After that point you should able to pick where to rent.  2. Check your unemployment benefit.  3. Make sure to roll over your 401k.
hm7kqh7,clearwaterrev,11/26/2021,1,You definitely wont be able to afford a $1300 apartment. You could afford to pay half of that with a roommate but I dont recommend spending more than 30% of your gross pay on housing.   I suggest you look for a better primary job rather than get a second job. You could also look for a new full-time job in a lower cost of living area.

hm7pb1e,tongboy,11/26/2021,1,There are two types of billpay transactions.  The kind where the check is basically an auto generated one with your account details on it. The money wont be drafted from your account until the check is cashed.  The second type the money is transferred to a settling account from your account and paid from that account.  The first is like youre describing the second (and much more common) is different
hm8h7la,BlackLotus0991,11/26/2021,1,NTA. Document document document. Take screenshots in case he tries to delete it. This is such a breach of trust who knows how many other people he has done this too.
hm758mt,sparselogic,11/26/2021,2,You might want to have a quick chat about that documentation with the labor board. From a quick glance looks like statute of limitations for unpaid wages is 1 year.  “The only time your employer ever has the right to withhold your paycheck is when you have given them written authorization to not hand over your paycheck on time. Thus if your employer is refusing to pay you what you have earned without having gotten your permission first you do have the right to get your money.  You can file a complaint with LARA’s Wage and Hour Division or file a lawsuit in court to recover your missing paycheck. However keep in mind that there is a 12 month statute of limitation in order to file a complaint for a withheld paycheck. This means if the complaint is not filed within 12 months (or a year) of not receiving your withheld paycheck then you have lost your right to file a complaint through LARA.”  https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/michigan-paycheck-laws.html

hm789gk,JustMePatrick,11/26/2021,40,I have Chase (which the OP states) and can confirm the payment would be withdrawn when it was submitted.  I would imagine OP could contact Chase to verify the check cleared.
hm73eyg,oliverthefish,11/26/2021,2,Depends on where you live but in Texas on 60 grand you can afford up to $2400 if you don’t have flashy spending habits.

hm81rad,WeepingSomnabulist,11/26/2021,1,Rarely. But sometimes you dont have enough cash on hand and you have pay somebody for services rendered informally by someone without a credit card machine. Like your friend took care of your dog or a relative built your fence whatever. Also sometimes older folks still write checks and give them to you for your birthday instead of cash. And then there are refunds from when the health insurance miscalculates something and actually cuts you a check for overpayment.  If it makes you feel any better Ive had the same pad of checks from my bank for the past 10+ years.
hm8dnp9,FastFourierTerraform,11/26/2021,1,Where are all of these FTHB programs coming from? I searched high and low and they basically either required you to have low income a FHA loan or your participation in a ~20 hour program for $500.

hm8hk6z,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,Just a few little things you might want to add.  Nothing major.  I see subscriptions hobbies date fund vacation but nothing for entertainment.  Assuming streaming services are under subscriptions do you use your date fund for general entertainment?  After you buy a home your utility costs will most likely increase.  You dont currently pay for or account for waste disposal.  Consider all expenses other than loan payments will increase at a rate similar to a inflation (gas and food increased dramatically this year).  Factor in expected income changes as well.  If you current budget only has you saving 1350/m you have 20k in savings and you want 55k for closing and down payment your about 2.5 years out.    Your down payment will require PMI.  As long as interest rates are low you might as well put the smallest down you can buy as soon as possible and start building equity soonest and invest the savings.
hm76nxg,vrtigo1,11/26/2021,1,>They should be able to cut you a physical check immediately if the funds have already been reversed by the bank  This right here.  If HR couldnt tell you with 100% certainty that the issue had been resolved and the funds would hit your account within 48 hours they should have just written you a physical check.
hm8bkel,SnappyShrimp,11/26/2021,1,Thank you for your insight. What you said may seem insensitive to outsiders looking in but it doesn’t to me because it’s unfortunately the reality for many people in our situation.   What state do you live in just so I can look up the Filial Responsibility Law? Also who did you contact to make arrangements to allow the state take over?
hm899aq,footballer2323,11/26/2021,1,Its late but if she doesnt start now it will only get later.  It will never get better.  She should do as much as she can for as long as she can.  And she likely needs to plan to work as long as she can also.
hm6sgzd,StillAll,11/26/2021,5,Dont set yourself on fire to keep others warm.  As long as you remember this you will get out of this alright.  Good luck!
hm79cap,famia,11/26/2021,1,Ill keep living in the house until I graduate. See where I will end up working. If its too far of a commute sell and rent nearer my place of work. Save the money earned selling the house into an investment vehicle and use it to buy a house once Im sure I want to plant my roots in the current area Im in.  Thats what Ill do atleast. imo there is no rush to sell unless the house is in a bad area. You dont need to juggle mortgage as well so you can start selling once you have secured the place you will be moving in to.
hm725km,wanttostayhidden,11/26/2021,2,>Repairs exceeding 75% of the value is the standard most insurance companies use.  This is state specific and insurance company specific.

hm76pck,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,1,> My ideal plan would be to get back to work as soon as I can after my program and pay the debt down ASAP thereafter though Im aware Bank of America dont do deferrals.  This plan is fine from a long term standpoint.  You need a short term one as well.  > By my statement I mean to say that my bad credit rating in the US doesnt have any bearing on my finances in Ireland so I technically still have a good credit rating here.  Sure but you stated that your goal was to return to the US in 2023.  Therefore your US based credit becomes very relevant.  > I have enough money to get myself through the degree but I dont have enough to spare to make even minimum payments. I want to pay back the bank but I literally cant at the moment.  This is the decision you get to make.  You can choose not to pay.  Your US based credit will be trashed.  You will likely not be eligible for auto loans/mortgages/credit upon your return in 2023.  Consider factoring this in for whatever living situation you are anticipating.   > Thanks for the link to the credit repair -- Im very conscious of what Ive done to myself with regard my credit rating but I guess I chose to gamble on earning more year on year

hm6wr8i,fuck_you__shoresy,11/26/2021,2,To make sure you have enough for your closing costs/down payments to strengthen your overall loan profile and any large withdrawals or deposits we can’t  ID offhand or source using the statements provided (ie movement from one account to another) IRS deposits transfers to your retirement accounts paying off debts listed on your credit report. Large defined as 50% or more of your gross monthly income. After that a quick skim through other transactions to look for things like undisclosed debt you’re paying on. I promise we don’t care how often you’re going to Wendy’s or that you shop at hugedildos.com three times a month. In years I have only ever noticed one thing that was hilarious and I’ve long since forgotten everything about the people it was associated with.
hm83xaz,WindfallForever,11/26/2021,1,What do you think is the smartest financial idea? Investing is definitely up there right?  I didnt include this in my post but a big priority of mine is to start investing in index funds. Ill be taking the money I earn from my bonuses and equity and throwing it there. Ill also be using this money to save for a down payment for a house. Not in a rush to buy because the market is bonkers right now and I dont know what I want.

hm6tbd5,ThrowHomeAwayM,11/26/2021,1,Osteoarthritis and chronic runners knee in both knees. Flat feet that led to tendonitis in both lateral and deltoid parts of the ankle. Nerve damage and osteoarthritis in the right shoulder. Some mental health conditions because my unit experienced some suicides and training accidents/deaths.  I was also on a clear team. Basically the dead body recovery team that finds what remains of soldiers and sends them to mortuary affairs specialists.  Most of my physical stuff is from rucking everywhere and not being given enough time to recover. Light infantry life is hell on the body

hm7y95q,josh5now,11/26/2021,1,Dont soft inquiries not affect your credit in any way? So all youd have to be careful of is not signing up for the credit offers you suddenly get. I dont care if the credit bureaus make money from that it was a bad investment for the credit companies who paid to know that I unlocked my credit cause theyre not going to make any money off of me.
hm6zq33,FindFIREsomeday,11/26/2021,1,This might not even be from your lender.   This is essentially life insurance but worse.... its more expensive and only pays off your mortgage.   Your loan is a public record.  Shady companies go through the records and will slap the name of your lender onto their advertising for this bad financial product.  Its very confusing.  Its not technically a scam..... but its awfully close.  Check the fine print to see if its actually from a different company.

hm73owb,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,I think $2k-3k is a little too much.  If you run the numbers on $175k 20 year mortgage @ 3.25% the payment is $993/month. So something like 480 interest + 600 extra will get it paid off even sooner than 20 years..
hm73wzy,MrX2285,11/26/2021,0,Why do people even use cheques? I swear they cause so many issues. Just use a reoccuring direct deposit!
hm7szju,k_lena,11/26/2021,1,A self employed 401k might help drop your MAGI enough to qualify for Roth contributions in future. They’re dead easy to set up and are offered by the 3 firms most commonly recommended here - Fidelity Vanguard and Schwab. You can contribute as an employee as well as profit sharing as the employer up to a combined max of 58k (19.5k as employee).
hm822lv,Just_the_typto,11/26/2021,1,u/sir_richard_head has no idea what he is talking about. A lawyer could do things you never even imagined. It takes 10 minutes to talk to them.

hm7ri8y,clove75,11/26/2021,1,Thats total BS. I have worked on payroll systems and what they should have done is issued you a check then and there once they saw the mistake. This is total incompetence. I would look for another employer. I have worked in number of hospitals and if we did this heads would roll. One thing we didnt mess with is our nurses checks.

Thats more than just bad taste/breach of trust - thats a major violation of privacy and the do-no-pass-Go-do-not-collect-$200 type of immediate firing.        I would contact the bank (not the branch itself but call the number on the back of your card and ask to speak to someone in corporate) to let them know whats going on.  Because if they are doing this sort of shady stuff to you 99% chance theyre doing it to others as well.

hm7jlku,___RAT___,11/26/2021,1,Wow. This is the US Im assuming? It seems so backwards. I wonder if the scale of all the bank transfers makes things difficult to update processes?  In Australia everything is or can be digital and recently these transfers all became instant. Ive not used cash since early 2019 and have never written a cheque as they were pretty much phased out late 90s or early 2000s.
hm8n7ui,ElectricTaser,11/26/2021,1,Yeah I’m like that as well. It sucks. I’m always amazed at how ~~fast~~ damn near instantaneously money can go out for most purchases but bills can take days. I have figured out over the years that my banks software will purposefully play with deposits and payments/ withdrawals to try to overdraft the account. Pretty sure if some one looked into it they would get a serious shit storm of negative press.

hm7158s,AcceptableStranger96,11/26/2021,2,Good points OP you are never going to have lower living expenses than you do now. Your GF should 100% be using this time to get whatever education and certifications which would further her career.  Get both of you into a good position where you can have good paying jobs in a bigger market (Atlanta?) sell and move.
hm7xrpr,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,As someone with a newborn on the way I think it makes the most sense to maintain one account personally. Not only is it easier but if one child decides to not pursue further education you limit your downside/potential withdrawal penalties.  Im eager to hear if anyone has any counter arguments.
hm79fwc,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,5,>There is really no minimum payment in student loan  Yes there is.

I commented on your incorrect representation of how the loan would impact their credit score.
hm86hw0,93195,11/26/2021,1,You’ll need to have at least 20% equity.  Assuming the lender (and their appraiser) agree it’s worth $280K max loan is $280K x .8 = $224K.  Re-fi closing costs probably eat up another $4K so max cash out is somewhere in the $60K range ($220K - $160K).  Keep in mind taking cash out means taking out a bigger loan than you currently have which means your monthly mortgage payment will go up.  There is no free money.  The best mortgage lender is whoever gives you the best deal.  Contact a mortgage broker and have them shop around.
hm7de1r,LyricalPig,11/26/2021,1,Good rule with buying cars: pay cash buy new only if your net worth is over $1m and total cars value not worth more than 1/2 your household income
hm830f8,ThomasRedstone,11/26/2021,1,As someone from the UK this is truly baffling.  Are you seriously saying that when someone in the USA talks about auto pay thats just your bank writing a cheque for you and posting it?  In the UK weve pretty damn close to dropping support for cheques.  Most people wont use one most years!  We have Detect Debit which automatically transfers money to a company you have an agreement with and it guarantees that if anything goes wrong the bank or the company will cover the costs.  Weve also got Standing Orders which send a fixed amount to another account how ever often you want it to but theyre more likely to be used between people than with companies.
hm844xj,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,I guess that’s my hold up. I have to find a way to get in touch with them to pay for it either settle for less or maybe with payments since I don’t have the full $1800.

hm7yykt,DownUnderPumpkin,11/26/2021,1,Why are bank stuff so complicated in the US here we just send the money to an account number no physical checks. Never used a check in my life seen it once.
hm6z7z8,Tsakax,11/26/2021,2,Moving stuff even with movers is a huge pain in the ass.  So I bought cheapo until I was ready to buy a house.  Now I have been buying things as needed for my house.  Definitely put the most money in a bed and if you work from home a office chair.
hm7qatt,Crazy_names,11/26/2021,1,I would add avoid things like Artillery Air Defense and other combat arms if you can qualify. I got respect for those guys but their jobs dont translate to the civilian sector very well. The one exception is the Air Defense if you stick around longer than 4 and go the warrant officer route. They have a big networking emphasis and net security skills.   But 15Q Air Traffic Control and the 35 series (Intel) are good if you want to work in government after. If you like computers and networking go for 25 series (network communications and security) but jobs like 88M (Truck Driver) can be good if you want to drive trucks or go back to Fedex/UPS as a driver. (I hear UPS is better).  Take advantage of Tuition Assistance while you are in and you can get a good jump on your degree whole you are in for basically free. You just have to be motivated enough to sacrifice nights and weekends. But more importantly look into certifications. 15T and other aircrew also feed into aircraft maintenance certifications that are really good jobs.

hm6sujr,haggiebaby,11/26/2021,2,Thats good to know.  Ironic that their mother and I could get dinged for just trying to be responsible with the money and make sure their college is taken care of from this tragedy (vs just spend the money on normal raising the kid stuff like groceries clothes typical daily expenses).    Two thoughts (and both could be wrong).  These are good kids/good students who really look up to their mom and anything she says is pretty much accepted.  (Because their mom is a great loving mom with a head on her shoulders... not because shes controlling).  I know kids can go sideways as they hit the teenage years but I cant imagine these kids would allege their mom is holding their money hostage and go to the SSA asking for it.    Worse case I assume we can withdraw the 529 money get dinged on any earnings and hand the balance over to the kids if they insisted on the money.  A part of me hates to forgo the benefits of a 529 plan just because the kids might (seems highly unlikely) want the money when they are 18 instead of use it for college.  And if they do want it to just spend/waste it once they are 18 that money is still there.
hm8l3cm,kbeezie,11/26/2021,1,Thats odd... Rejecting claims due to personal transactions would only apply for protection if you made the transactions yourself.  Your account was compromised thats a whole different matter.

hm6t7fq,CQME,11/26/2021,1,>With inflation rising should we move our extra payments to a brokerage account?  What is the reasoning here?  That stocks will rise as inflation rises?  That reasoning simply doesnt hold at least for the foreseeable future.  [Stocks right now are priced for a low-to-no-inflation environment P/E of 39.](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)  This level of P/E can only be sustained by ZIRP from the Fed why?  Because a P/E of 39 means investors are happy with a 2.5% rate of return from the stock market since they can borrow at near zero and make 2.5%.  If inflation rises the Fed will discontinue ZIRP and will force the market to raise its expectations for rate of return thus lowering P/E ratios.  This equates to a sustained decline in stocks if this scenario comes about (hard to imagine it not coming about).  TLDR the market is in a massive bubble right now.  Caveat emptor.
hm7s8f9,BoredDanishGuy,11/26/2021,1,You guys still use actual physical cheques?
hm7qf0g,RickMuffy,11/26/2021,1,Sounds like a cashiers check more so than a regular check to guarantee the funds are there when the check is cashed.
hm8i6k1,SnooSketches4722,11/26/2021,1,When we ran a storage facility this happened there as well. I was a little confused the first time it happened but then it happened more regularly. The most in one envelope was 4 different tenant rental checks.

Even if the money from the original ACH attempt isnt returned yet what reasonably sized business cant float a single paychecks worth of cash for a week or so?  Just cut a paper check employee is happy the law is followed and everyone can move on.

There would have been no reason for them to send her such a check if they were immediately going to say oh you didnt spend it before you turned 18 send it back.

hm8jq43,gitcommitfuckit,11/26/2021,1,I previously worked in retail banking and moving funds over to a different account within the same financial institution will not help you. You don’t know how desperate this person is or whether the teller has messaged other customers asking them for money as well.  The teller absolutely has access to your PII including your SSN. Right now I recommend putting a freeze on your SSN with all the credit bureaus. This should only take you 15 minutes to do but might help you have some peace of mind. Ultimately the teller should not be working in banking at all- please report this to a branch manager in person ASAP.
hm7evk9,withfries,11/26/2021,1,This is correct.  Personal example: Chase withdraws it from your account. If its not cashed in a certain amount of time it is returned to your account.  Schwab Bank does not do this - nothing is withdrawn until the check is cashed.
hm8h8ff,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,1,I’ve made a (sometimes bad) habit of giving people the benefit of every doubt and this is a downfall of that. I should have handled it more quickly.   It is a major US Bank if you get my drift.
hm7e94r,JellyDenizen,11/26/2021,1,Are you sure your report says 49 percent and not 49 months or 49 payments?  If youve made 4 years of payments thats 48 payments.
hm8q2y4,Lollc,11/26/2021,1,Would an engine block heater be a good thing?  I couldnt find a consensus on line.
hm8j70z,asks_mrtgg_questions,11/26/2021,1,I was unaware you can access the Roth for this - thanks for letting me know! I tend to be more cautious with my finances but the urge of wanting to stay in my area had me itching to buy as its shown no sign of slowing down. FOMO sucks :|. However as much as I want to stay I would rather wait until I have more cash available before diving in. Fingers crossed this area cools down a bit lol
hm8bmzw,Scarovese,11/26/2021,1,The best time to contribute was the first day possible. The second best time is now.
hm7r8au,93195,11/26/2021,1,You overpaid.  You’re going to need some cash to get yourself out of this but if you have some saved up sell the truck for as much as you can get and make up the difference in cash to pay off the note.
hm8o0k0,McG0788,11/26/2021,1,Tellers would have access to a fair amount of personal info. At least when I worked as one we had all the major details youd need.  As far as transferring they could also do a transfer from any acct to any other as needed. Sure theres supposed to be signatures but those only get looked at by the teller or some other bank staff should something be amiss.
hm7bhdh,QV79Y,11/26/2021,1,Your own individual budget is more important than any rule of thumb about how much you should spend on rent. It depends on what all your other spending and savings are. Only you can figure that out.
hm8lrcd,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,In short its like a 401k except is from after tax money however the gains are not taxed but the max amount you can put in it is 6k a year and it gets lower if you make more than 125k a year. Also you are allowed to withdraw the money you invested with no penalties.
hm83gk9,m3003,11/26/2021,1,The form has the tax year on it. You cannot file your taxes before January 15. The IRS doesnt accept them THAT early.  https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf
hm8sx1q,Douglers,11/26/2021,11,Not in the U.S. but Id think that the bank itself would provide you free credit protection with this violation.
hm78g3y,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,3,You have 11$ left you dont know what to do with? Am I understanding that right? For such a small amount Id drop that into one of your savings or fun accounts.
hm792pu,Phoenix2683,11/26/2021,1,Incorrect.  If they lost it its standard practice to stop the check and re-issue them a new one because funds wouldnt be taken from your account. If they lose it they should deduct the stop check fee.  This case is a bit different because the OP doesnt have the money but neither does the landlord from the sounds of it. Chase is the one who failed here. They sent the check but never dealt with a stale dated check that hasnt been deposited. They should have followed up with it and like OP said refunded the money if it wasnt cashed.  You have no clue if the landlord even received the check mail delivery is atrocious right now.
hm8ea17,Appropriate_Mention4,11/26/2021,1,Wait his financial advisor told you to Leave free money on the table? Do 6% so you get full match and free money. I started my job 18 I maxed 401k even when I didnt have a dime. I wish I start at 12! I never regret it for a second. But people who didnt do regret it. You cant barrow money to retire. You will thank yourself if you save 401k money early. Earlier the better. Do not leave matching funds on the table. Please at least 6% ASAP. Good luck
hm8gko5,Ease-Anxious,11/26/2021,1,Have you ever legally fought for what is rightfully yours? This person has a legitimate labor complaint and Ive been in the Army where playing nice didnt get you anywhere Ive ran a business where letting people not pay gets your power turned off and Ive worked for fortune 500 companies who had me a check cut within 3 days of a minuscule pay issue.   The last thing Id ever suggest to someone is that they need to debase themselves by begging for what theyre legally entitled to.

hm722l6,YMarkY2,11/26/2021,1,I have a concerning question that you may or may not have thought about. You have a bachelor degree and between both you and your wife you bring home about $4k / month. That seems awful low for someone with a bachelor degree.   Before taking on the time/money of pursuing a Masters degree have you thought about what the financial benefit will be? Your bachelor degree isnt providing you with a very high salary especially in a high COL area. Are you certain a Masters will be worth it financially? What is a decent federal job? Lot of things to consider before making this commitment.
hm74dy7,oliverthefish,11/26/2021,1,Ah I’d Keep it parked right at 1750 with that consideration.
hm8htlo,QuietFridays,11/26/2021,1,I assumed they phrased that incorrectly and really meant including those things.  Like they meant after paying rent groceries etc.
hm8htar,cballowe,11/26/2021,1,The reason the banks gave was always we assume your biggest expenses are things like rent car and utilities so we run the biggest ones first because the consequences of bouncing them is big - whether thats the right thing to do or not is a different question but thats the logic they claim.
hm83ky1,Specific-Rich5196,11/26/2021,1,Sounds like you are between 20 and 25% gross in retirement accounts which is great. Some say thats the minimum to retire comfortably. You are doing great keep it up.
hm7hhem,PeppyPinto,11/26/2021,1,What is the age of the house?  Our first home was newly built and we lived there 10 years with little to no excessive maintenance.  We just bought a 40 year old house and the list of maintenance items are stacked out the back.   Im pricing the things I know are going to be needing replacement in the next 5 years (roof newly discovered electrical issues etc) and creating a fund for it so we arent caught off guard when the time comes.   I dont know that sq ft matters but I also dont really have any specific numbers I can give you.
hm7dzx4,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,I am like you haha I pay my credit cards daily! precisely for that!
hm7rjib,ThatStonkyGirl,11/26/2021,1,Technically the check could have gotten lost in the mail and never cashed. This happened to us and we just wrote a new check to the landlord.
hm835rj,coren77,11/26/2021,1,If it was an auto-send check oftentimes the amount is debited from the account when the check goes out.   So OP would have seen money come out like every month.  If Landlord never cashed it funds should have re-appeared in his account within a few months.  if funds never re-appeared what is he supposed to do?
hm7gb7q,Handlesmcgee,11/26/2021,1,20k for a 2011 ram with 100k+ ouch I really feel for you on that one my first car was a 2005 bmw m5 for 22k had like 90k on it and quickly learned about bmw repair costs. I ended up selling it for 5k pretty much to a guy needing parts for his.  learned my lesson and got a Honda Civic the next time and never had another problem till it got totaled 6 years later. I my opinion I wouldn’t put a dime into that truck either sell it now and take the 10k hit or drive it till it’s on rims and get 800$ in scrap at the junkyard. Best of luck to you man next time spring for the Tacoma lol
hm7ehhf,Pikesmakker,11/26/2021,1,Unless you literally cannot afford to contribute that additional 4-2% youre leaving free money on the table.
hm7f5pr,ctles,11/26/2021,1,Right now Im trying tiller so i guess $79/yr?
hm7icgh,inkheart58,11/26/2021,1,Is Quicken regulated in any way?
hm8kg38,CyberSecurityGuy1,11/26/2021,1,Question for you all   In the terms and conditions it states:   Although Fair will not transfer losses on the pooled investment account to customer accounts these accounts are NOT FDIC INSURED and are subject to possible loss.  If Fair will not transfer losses to customer accounts and your money is protected by SIPC if they were to go out of business other than the 4% interest you earn month to month what other loss could you be open to?
hm8b8bf,deja-roo,11/26/2021,1,> The US banking system is not nearly as heavily regulated  Uhhhh yes it is.... we just have a lot of legacy systems to support and old regulations that conflict.
hm7r6q4,majestrate,11/26/2021,1,Normally you can contribute 8-12% without it impacting your take home. You should use a 401k calculator to see how much you can contribute before your paycheck is affected
hm6wwrt,rallyally,11/26/2021,1,Unfortunately there’s not really an in person option between the working from home employees/overall short staffed hospital. I did try that first though.

hm8cvyt,CitationNeededBadly,11/26/2021,1,You havent mentioned talking to your supervisor at all.  What did they say?   If your pay is  2 weeks overdue \*your\* supervisor should have already escalated this to \*their\* supervisor or higher.
hm88qnw,CaptainNayak,11/26/2021,1,That’s incredible! I was always under the impression I’d get some sort of credibility being an authorized user on her account but 800 is exceptional. Would this apply to when we buy a house together too?
hm7t1hv,TheGavPav,11/26/2021,1,No idea I did just switch jobs tho so that’s something to look into
hm7pcf8,RealMccoy13x,11/26/2021,1,It can be but you need to understand why. The CFPB doesnt care about your story. They only care about what subsections were violated. If you give them a nasty yelp review they will close your complaint in most cases. The exception is if the bank decides they do not want to invest the time to review the complaint and just award you the loss amount. I recommend you focus in on what you believe you were wronged about because they normally wont let you file twice on the same issue. Sometimes there are some technicalities for an easy win but sometimes you are outright liable and even they will let you know it.
hm7umea,GreedyNovel,11/26/2021,1,Well I dont think theyre good for an e-fund either because you cant withdraw them for the first year. The whole point of an e-fund is being able to withdraw on demand at any time.  >I can’t think of another reason why a FA would advise against I-bonds for an E-fund  Maybe there is a good reason you havent thought of?
hm728ig,bakedpotatoe17,11/26/2021,4,Yea they’re really just concerned with where your earnest money and down payment are coming from and then verifying that you don’t receive suspicious large cash deposits. Typically even if you do have something weird it can be cleared through underwriting with a letter of explanation which just tells them how/what/why.
hm73tym,Tubbysweetbundle011,11/26/2021,2,Makes sense. Have a newborn too and would set up a Roth IRA through an LLC I have if I could do it without raising any red flags
hm74zr7,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,Are you sure its $35 a day? For 3 days its probably only $35 fee (per transaction). Usually after something like 5-10 days is when they start adding the daily overdraft fee.  Check the terms of your loan what is the penalty for late payment? Is there a grace period?
hm7z012,Dilettantest,11/26/2021,1,Talk to the bank: you might be able to open a separate custodial account to receive that SSDI payment then you could transfer the entire amount to your transactions account.  IANAL but I’d think you might also want to remove her name from that transactions account.  IRS debt isn’t discharged in bankruptcy but you can try to do an “offer in compromise” to get that debt down.  I doubt you’d be successful though because you do have equity in your home.  So see if you can increase your income by getting a weekend job to earn take home pay of at least $500-600/ month.  You could decrease your expenses by $100/month by changing your cellphone provider…  …and another $100 by just getting fast internet (you’ll probably pay $70-80/month by dropping cable).  If you could do that you’d be able to breathe a little more freely while you work on your business.

hm75fai,WideStep5201,11/26/2021,1,I’m with Fidelity now self managing. I’d be switching for access to the pledged asset line of credit and mortgage rates. Does fidelity have the line of credit? I haven’t been able to find anything on the website.
hm8g1vq,paligators,11/26/2021,1,Lock your credit is what you can do. It will take 15 minutes and give you a bit of comfort that nobody is creating accounts using your identity.
hm74shg,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,2,When youre uneasy the best thing you can do is move money from your account you get direct deposit into a separate account specific for bills and transfer money into that to account for stuff on autopay to make sure it gets paid. This can help from over spending. Then when you want to eat out or whatever you can still use your CC but you want to ensure theres money in your bank account to pay off your cc.
hm7qjkw,wickedkittylitter,11/26/2021,1,Or the W4s arent filled out correctly.  That would mean the OP is getting a significant refund.
hm79ju7,Tops161,11/26/2021,1,Sometimes you gotta find the email of the big boss and directly contact him/her (President Senior Supervisor etc.). They’re usually pretty bored so they’d be happy to help. I’ve done this numerous times and it’s gotten me quick results as opposed to going through multiple different employees who are content with passing your issue around.
hm8czd3,93195,11/26/2021,1,Technically yes you should add her.  Yes your rates will likely go up if you do.  That said others occasionally driving your car with your permission are covered by your insurance so as long as no one looks too close it’s unlikely to be an issue.  But the “correct” answer is that she should be on the policy.  Regarding comprehensive coverage that covers damages not caused by collision (tree falls on it thieves break into it etc).  You have to have collision coverage to get it but it usually doesn’t add a ton of cost in addition to collision.  The collision coverage (beyond just liability) is what’s expensive but without it none of your damages are covered.
hm7wke2,MathandMarketsCFA,11/26/2021,1,Theres a dominant strategy thats better than what you suggested depending on his vesting schedule.   He should contribute and then early withdraw and just pay the 10% penalty. Hell have more cash on hand than in your scenario. So if you want to establish the emergency fund you still contribute 6%.
hm8ek9v,WillyValentine,11/26/2021,1,Report that person immediately.  They should not be working in any aspect of banking or peoples money.  I would do it immediately over the phone with a supervisor and follow it up at the branch tomorrow or Monday morning.   This is so over the line ...
hm73u6v,Stinka27,11/26/2021,1,Add Carguru to the list. I just did the Carmax Vroom Carvana etc. thing. Carmax had the best price but my title was incorrect when I went to sell to them. Was going to DMV the next day to fix title and did a quick Google. Carguru offered a couple thousand more AND they came to pick it up with the check in hand.  Try all of them before you make a decision used cars are going for big money right now.
hm8k1qt,Carldamonkey,11/26/2021,1,Use a credit card for these recurring payments instead of your checking account. Transaction order will not matter to you at all you’ll pay the full balance once per month
hm8pnu3,jasperjava,11/26/2021,1,Make sure you can register and insure a salvage vehicle in your state. Some states are more friendly towards this and others have a million requirements/inspections that need to be met.
hm841pr,slayer1am,11/26/2021,1,I recommend watching a few financial youtube channels like the Money Guy Show or Minority Mindset.  Find one that you like and make a habit of watching it regularly.  Finances isnt something to figure out from one reddit post spend some time learning it slowly.       Now youre doing pretty good for 90K a year and only 1200/month in rent.  The key here is to maintain a balance of quality of life and saving for the future.       Starting out your first goal is to get an emergency fund together say two or three months worth of expenses that is kept in a liquid account like checking.       Also check with your company as soon as possible to find out if they do matching contributions to a retirement account if they do its free money and you should max it out.       So retirement accounts:  IRA is Individual Retirement Account it can be either a Roth or a traditional 401K but both are IRAs.  Im not an expert on those and I wont try to educate you here Im sure others will provide a better breakdown.       Once you have the emergency fund saved up and youve figured out which IRA to setup now its time for brokerage accounts.  The point of this account is to provide extra income and grow your savings faster.  Theres lots of good brokerages like Fidelity M1 Finance WeBull etc.  Ideally they should not charge you anything to open the account and also not charge you to trade stocks or funds etc.       I know thats a lot of information but thats why I started out mentioning good youtube channels to follow.  This is going to take time to process and you should not rush it.  We havent even started on taxes........

hm6zn88,93195,11/26/2021,5,If it hasn’t been cashed cancel the check and issue a new one.  Things get lost sometimes.  It happens.  That’s why you send a check not cash.

hm7lxh2,TK_TK_,11/26/2021,1,That sounds great! You are super close to having yourself on really solid footing and being able to stretch to new goals—just have to finish getting rid of the debt and getting used to your new budget. I use my bonus for nice-to-haves every year like a powder room update vacation fund throwing into 529s. Just because you never know—I did get a full bonus in 2020 for example but I know a lot of people my age who were used to bonuses and budgeted using them who didn’t get one. Just solidified in my mind the idea of setting your spending habits on your base only.   I didn’t have a job with a big bonus until I already had an emergency fund established but that seems like a great way to knock it out.  All that said—money doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Have a line in your budget for a little fun spending too.

hm7ai4b,HittemWithTheLamp,11/26/2021,3,My advice would be join a different branch if you’re only going to pay for college. Army and Marines have pretty awful quality of life. If you have a clean record and high enough ASVAB join the Air Force or maybe Navy but choose a job in connected to boats.

hm7xcri,Scr0bD0b,11/26/2021,1,If Im reading this correctly you had $10K of cc debt decided not to get a job but instead pile on an additional $15K for a second masters?  What was your plan before going into this for paying it off?  (seeing as good credit cards should be paid off in full each month ideally).  Two masters degrees and youre only going to make $40K?  Maybe you should look into doing a less intensive masters program so that you can also work...
hm77b5p,SecretExplorer355,11/26/2021,1,still that’s about 12 hours unaccounted for
hm786aw,pbrew,11/26/2021,1,Establish early the habit to save. Maximizing 401K is one of the first steps. Major tax advantage. And matching is free money.  Even if it leaves less for you  it sets you up and prevents life style creep.
hm8lo13,dizzyforglizzy,11/26/2021,1,I doubt it even feels uncomfortable unless you intend to save super aggressively and retire early. It’s probably a safe bet about your friend why not ask him? It’ll feel different and maybe short term like you’ve gone down on your cash flow but the numbers say you can afford it.
hm8dv53,bittz128,11/26/2021,1,Get the free money from work by hitting their match limit but also put some aside in an emergency fund.  If you don’t have rent this should be what you put there. No car payment?  Put it aside.  The free money and 8% and higher rate of return will pay off in the long run.  School loans have a low interest rate and are tax deducted - but only when you make below 75k.  Deductions phase out above this.  If you fall on hard times a 401k can be used as an emergency fund tax free.  You would classify it as a “hardship”.  Your dad is a smart man but likely doesn’t know all the advantages of a 401k  Edit:  A lot of people pointing out that you should pay down the 0 point loan but think for a second. If I lose nothing now by paying minimum on the loan in order to make 200 more a month that will get an 8% return wouldn’t I want to get in there early?  I imagine your school loans will be less than 5%.  If I’m making 8% and paying 5% I’m ahead by 3 points and still made the extra cash and time to compound my investment.  Cash is king and the more of it you have on your side in (preferably making interest to keep ahead of inflation) is in your favor. It will allow you to weather the long term storms better.  School loans also have hardship deference and deferment if you go back to school.

hm77lcn,Xenikovia,11/26/2021,1,I dont understand every check that clears your bank \~ there is a digital record of the front and back of the check. Walk into your branch and speak to the bank manager. If the funds were taken out of  your checking account the bank has to provide proof of it.
hm8emf0,pfinancelurker,11/26/2021,1,VTI will do 10% on average (nominal) over long investment horizons. 60% (whatever that may be in dollar terms) likely isn’t worth going exploring alt investments.
hm8u2af,ZenGuruji,11/26/2021,2,Call your insurance company and see what they advise. You can probably call her and get her insurance info.  In the future always get driver information and insurance info when there’s an accident. Also call for a police report as soon as the accident occurs. Who cares if the other driver thinks it’s no big deal? You want to protect yourself.
hm7s9lx,Fiyahead,11/26/2021,1,It seems like their pay period is behind 2 weeks. Meaning your hours from 25th -  5th (2 week period) will be paid out on the 26th(today). Check with your HR. Some workplace are like this. I know I waited a whole month for a pay because of the pay period cycle.

hm6zgbz,i_need_a_username201,11/26/2021,3,I’m not an accountant or anything but tell me of this makes sense:  Have the “kids” cash it out now and they pay ordinary income taxes on it based on their income (10%). Then invest that in a brokerage account and they only have to pay long term capital gains taxes (15%) on the growth when withdrawn. Does that makes sense? If they don’t pay taxes now they’ll have to pay ordinary income taxes on everything later am I right?  If the kids were adults I would agree with you but since they’re minors with no income I’m wondering if getting the taxes out of the way is a good idea. I hope I’m clear all questions if I’m not clear.   But again get this confirmed by a pro if my assumptions are wrong it could cost you.
hm8t03t,sassyrogue,11/26/2021,82,Yup same. They have to acknowledge you first.
hm892ce,93195,11/26/2021,1,Yes.  I mean you need more than just credit score to buy a house (income and cash) but your credit score will be fine.

hm8izjs,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,1,Okay let me blunt.   We all like to tell ourselves fairytales to make  ourselves feel better. This man has access to your full name home address  phone number Facebook account and everything this bank has authorized him to see.    He chose to victimize you. Ya know how you get to be good  at being at bad guy? You choose victims not likely to get you caught.   Call the banks security/fraud number NOW.   This man is a threat to you your money his employer and God knows who else.   You feel violated because you have been violated.   If you knew a criminal had gotten your banking information your ssn address  etc and contacted you on Facebook asking you for money what would you do? What would you tell your mother to do? What would you tell your daughter to do?   THIS GUY IS A CRIMINAL.   Lets hope its limited to being a con-artist.  Please put a freeze on your credit right now.   Please be safe.

hm80pf1,BHarcade,11/26/2021,1,FASFA applications have a special circumstance clause (which includes abuse) but you need to notify the financial aid office after you fill out the application. If that doesn’t work then you are looking at an unsubsidized loan. There’s more info [here](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/parent-info)
hm7fb42,DBCOOPER888,11/26/2021,1,Getting the full match should be the first priority because its a 100% return and then you can focus on those other things. Like if something happened and you needed to pull from an emergency fund if you took an early withdrawal from your 401k youd still come out ahead compared to not investing to the match even considering the fees youd pay.
hm788sh,Stop_The_End,11/26/2021,0,Emergency fund and clear obligations first. He’s right.
hm6x4y1,zorinlynx,11/26/2021,6,Let me second this. Going the labor board/lawyer way makes sense if youre leaving and they wont give you your last check but if youre just starting youre also trying to create a good first impression and threatening to sic lawyers and the labor board on them aint that.  If this becomes a recurring problem down the line thats different but this is the FIRST check. Give them a chance to fix it.
hm823pd,rawdoogie,11/26/2021,1,Used cars are a ripoff right now. Even if your income + NW was different my opinion would be the same. Youre talking about 50k miles of wear and tear and an expiring B+B warranty for only 5k savings. Comparing (2019 Camry Hybrid LE $27500 50k miles) in my local Autotrader to NEW listings (2022 Camry Hybrid LE MSRP $28664) I see an even smaller gap in my area (1-3K) in some cases the used 2019s are listed for MSRP!!!!!! This doesnt even factor in the reduced interest rates you can get on a NEW vehicle. Basically free money with the inflation that we are seeing. I wont even go into wear and tear over 3 years and 50k miles.  The age old thought process that buying a new car is bad does not apply in this market. Used car prices have inflated so much that the savings of buying used no longer beats  buying new IMO. Id go for manufacturers that dont typically have crazy cash on the hood deals during the normal markets and typically sell closer to MSRP (Toyota Honda Subaru Tesla etc.)  Buying a new car is going to take some effort in the current market. You will need to make some calls or site visits and find a dealer that is selling at MSRP with no BS markups or addons. They do exist but you will need to do some hunting. Once you find one easiest thing to do is put in a factory order for what you want and take delivery in 3+ months. Or you can choose from an inbound vehicle and put down a deposit. This will be faster than a factory order. Some manufactures (Toyota is one) DO NOT do custom factory orders. Instead they only allow you to make a selection from their inbound factory allotment. For your Camry you will need to ask the dealer to go through their inbound inventory and choose which one you want to put a deposit on. My local Toyota dealer has inbounds that are about 4-5+ weeks out depending on model.  Good luck!
hm7621k,OneEyedWonderWiesel,11/26/2021,1,Company I work for has a bill pay system and it doesn’t debit the account until the check is cashed
hm7w0d3,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,1,See? This is another one of those choices I was talking about -- find your comfort level.  Ive lived through some disasters where the electricity was out for days to weeks. Cash was king. I was grateful for having our version of a go bag with cash. I lived through the week of no markets after 9/11. So Im somewhat jaded about how fast you can pull your moneyif you have to. As you can see for me my choices make sense.  I know my comfort level and what I value most. Knowing I have cash in hand vs making as much as I possibly can was and is a fair trade in my world.  It really is like say a Ferrari. Sure its pretty and fast but I am willing to pay the cost? Everyone has a different answer. For me I was and am willing to pay the price for the certainty that an emergency fund in both cash in hand and a high yield savings account brings me. No doubt  it has the potential to earn much higher yields but  the risk isnt it worth it to me. So my investments are money I can part with if I had to.   Choice doesnt mean right vs wrong. Its more about fit in my opinion. Your choices fit you. Mine fit me. Its a  life to live not a game to win.
hm6sqln,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,Some Credit One cards do not have a grace period. If you already have several cards consider not using it (if theres no annual or monthly fee) or just closing it.  It could also be that you lost the grace period at some point for carrying a balance and never regained it by letting the account sit with no activity and/or with $0 statement balance for a month.
hm7x7r1,slayer1am,11/26/2021,1,Save it.  Open a bank or credit union account and deposit it.  Get into the habit of saving whatever you can and invest it once you save up a few months worth of expenses.  In other words keep a few months expenses in the bank account move anything above that into a brokerage account like Fidelity M1 finance or similar.

hm87rxt,iambatmanjoe,11/26/2021,1,So this isnt a direct answer just my own experience. My partner bought her rental about a year before we got married. We discussed waiting but the opportunity popped up and she grabbed it. She used a first time homebuyer program. We moved in together got married then two years later at found another rental I was able to use a first time homebuyer program. So we each own one. Worked out really well. Shes on hers Im on mine. We manage them together
hm8tk9t,Z0RN92,11/26/2021,2,Call your insurance provider and file a claim against them. They will have to pay to have it fixed
hm8dz61,RubyRidgebackmomma,11/26/2021,1,Depends on the state you live in as well. For instance in Oregon insurance follows the car not the person. So if I have full coverage anyone is covered to drive it. Now of course the insurance co. wants to know all drivers so they can base your rates on them as well. But if you don’t tell them most they could do is exclude that person from your policy for the future or cancel you. But they would have to pay the claim. But that’s just Oregon each state has different insurance laws.
hm7ih2u,danas831,11/26/2021,1,Yes do this. My mom wound up in the hospital with a bill over $100k (guillian barre). The hospital got me in touch with Medicaid rep. You will probably have to dig up bank statements and such but they will get the bills covered and get her into a nursing home if she can’t take care of herself.
hm8pfdd,ITryHardSometimes,11/26/2021,1,If you can get your own land and a mobile home with a metal roof that is much more affordable than a stick or brick House and you can get it all paid off quick and have less debt then you’ll have money to invest in yourself so that you can make more money and then do whatever you want. Be aware that some land requires Wells and septic tanks which are a hefty investment in themselves.
hm8iqqo,ReferHvacGuy,11/26/2021,1,Open an online investing account like robinhood (but not robinhood. I don’t know what better ones there are in the US) and just get it out of there and transfer it over. You can do that quickly and just keep a cash position in the investment account and usually transfer it out for free later. Or invest it lol

hm8jxf4,6553321,11/26/2021,1,I believe most bill pay checks are physical checks that get mailed. They can easily get intercepted by multiple people including the mailman the admin at the landlord or a bank employee. Someone could have cashed the check for cash instead of depositing to the account. This is a police report and not the OPs responsibility.
hm6vsvm,MinxManor,11/26/2021,1,Right out of college I worked for a company that tried to cheat me out of 2 weeks pay.

When it did show up it came in the form of a state check.
hm6vsuh,microbial64,11/26/2021,2,Ive used rocket in the past.  We had rates from our credit union.  We recently used better.com which I hadnt heard of. We chose them only for the lowest rate (with points) as it pays off eventually since we plan to stay in the home at least 15y It was eventually moved to Wells Fargo. Filo is probably similar. I rarely mind the servicer and concentrate on price alone but thats my preference. Ymmv.
hm83z8x,Chonan_Akira,11/26/2021,1,I usually take cash from the money market fund. I rebalance periodically usually when I feel good about where the market is and add some to the money market fund.   In times of market disruption like today I do exactly nothing. I use an asset allocation that I mean to stick with during any ups or downs in the market. I review that allocation about yearly again when Im feeling okay about what the market is doing.   Not too scientific but I sleep well at night.
hm6u8ax,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,2,Has your sister called the insurance company and asked to have the check issued in a different name? My bank does this in rare scenarios when an Executor is having trouble cashing a check.  Did your mom have a will? Did she have a Probate?

hm7n2i4,Just_the_typto,11/26/2021,1,Looks like a good strategy man. Doesnt sound like you are worried about disposable income. If you can invest you should invest. Otherwise your dollars that you worked so hard for are doing nothing for you. Uninvested money hasnt even been earned because what you invest is what you are paying yourself.
hm8hayq,TwoWrongsAreSoRight,11/26/2021,1,Its not harsh at all.  In fact I highly doubt youre the first person hes done this to.  Getting fired is the very least that should happen if it was indeed him.  I work in IT and in my career Ive had access to peoples emails their employee records and just about every other piece of data the companies have.  A high level of professional integrity is absolutely required when you have access to sensitive data and this person has shown none.   In addition to speaking to the bank Id also speak to the local donut consumption engineer about possibly being able to get a protective order on the grounds of being afraid this person might do something when terminated.
hm73ee8,red5765,11/26/2021,2,I would tell you to pay the minimums because you can earn more interest by investing (Id recommend this for most loans <7% interest.  But youre going to get  a lot of different opinions in here.  Id put that $11k in a High yield savings account for the wedding and emergency fund.  Thats enough to cover $2.5k for the wedding and 4.5 months of expenses.  You can open a high yield savings account and save for separate things (create categories).  Id create a separate category for your emergency fund wedding and house.  Since you want to buy a home in less than a year you should save it in a HYSA instead of investing cuz the market is unpredictable.  Yeah so just pay the min on those loans and save/invest.  If you through everything left over after your loan payments into the HYSA you should have at least $10k in the house fund after 12 month (835\*12) = $10020.  Then if your spouse is contributing $10k and your parents are contributing $10k youll have $30k for a 10% down payment on a 300k home in one year!

hm78hdj,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,4,Im not young and I understand the value of an emergency fund.  But free money is free money you dont turn that down unless it means financial hardship.  OP should put in 6% to get the employer match and then spend all the rest of their disposable income building up a larger emergency fund.
hm8b7sj,iponeverything,11/26/2021,1,On a personal level Its good for some for others it others its not. It can be leveraged into plenty of opportunities if you have the right personality though these types of people would do well regardless.  My recommendation would be to keep the positive attitude and keep looking at ways to make your own opportunities and keep the military in your pocket as a backup plan.
hm6u8a9,parasuta,11/26/2021,1,Im on my phone Ill fully read these resources before I answer as Im likely to give a dumb answer otherwise. But my understanding is that currently I am trying to roll over my traditional 401k to a traditional IRA. Mostly because Im not happy with the investment options my pass companys account had access to but I used it for the match
hm6u9rj,blondie401,11/26/2021,2,I would check to see if Filo services the loan or not and decide if you’re comfortable with them selling it (if they don’t retain servicing). A lot of people don’t consider who services their loan when getting a mortgage but it can make a big difference to your experience after your loan closes.

hm7971c,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,Yeah they dont have to respond to your complaint. Theoretically they could toss it in the trash.   Filing a Dispute has rules. Filing a CFPB complaint has rules.   But no rules on an internal complaint   Honestly they were probably tired of you calling and they tossed your feedback in the trash.
hm7o6kl,facerollwiz,11/26/2021,1,I would contribute up to the company match and get a second job 10-15 hours a week for emergency fund and student loan pay down if it’s that important to do that.
hm882y7,MDfoodie,11/26/2021,1,You have a great credit score but next to no history. The number itself isn’t everything.
hm87h53,gritandkisses,11/26/2021,1,Re your last statement: the bank would cut a physical check and send it via usps. If that piece of mail got lost then no one really is at fault here. Your course of action for OP does stand thought. Push the bank harder to determine if the check was cashed. If it truly wasn’t then cancel the check and recut it. The mail has been running truly abysmally slow so I could see that the landlord would give a month or two leeway or someone they know usually pays a certain way and on time otherwise before they start reaching out about the issue.
hm6y9kf,reijn,11/26/2021,1,So if hes leaving before December 31st of this year he would owe it by April of 2022?
hm8omu4,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,Wells Fargo is notorious for this.    If you are paycheck to paycheck the best advice I can recommend is pay everything with a credit card that you can and change the due dates or payment dates for everything you cant to 4-5 days after your payday.  The overdraft fees really eat into savings and when times are tough thats good taken out of the cupboard.  If you call customer service they might reverse some of them if this isnt a regularly occuring issue.

hm7pqxt,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,I agree. Just about everyone is hiring and somehow you cant find a job....of any sort? Not even McDonalds will hire you...until you can get something better paying? Sounds like you need to lose the house.
hm8hxxx,selfemployed0202,11/26/2021,1,Sorry no!  OP had the mindset that this wasnt right - what about the person who doesnt know or feels sorry for the person and gives them $?  We all know that OP is not the 1st nor the last person this teller has contacted.  It is worse than catfishing on dating or any other site.  If the teller wants to get married - hitting customers up for cash is a shitty way to figure out how to pay for that life.  If teller and SO cant afford a big wedding the court house is cheap and does the job.  Seriously this is the worst advice
hm8dkbf,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,In your situation I wouldnt bother with saving for a down payment.  Use a VA loan and get into a home while interest rates are low.  You only need to have sufficient savings for your emergency account which I would have at least 5% of the homes purchase price plus six months of expenses.  The 10k you will have in two months should cover about half of that.  After your home situation is settled then look at your expenses again and pay everything you dont need to your future self.
hm7lkpg,benj_frito,11/26/2021,1,If I understand it correctly choosing the target retirement index fund route would be putting all contributions towards that same fund? Also in terms of choosing the best fund for her should I just go with whatever has the lowest expense ratio?
hm8quyj,Sw429,11/26/2021,6,Yes this is a big deal. The teller should at the very least be fired. Its simply not okay.
hm8kz2b,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,So the payments would all just bounce and youd get charged return item fees by the companies youre paying. This doesnt sound like a better solution.

hm7rcb2,madmoneymcgee,11/26/2021,1,Take the match. If the $60 dollars (thereabout) to get you to the full six percent is a serious crimp in your monthly cash flow then you have issues beyond anything your dad brings up.
hm85vaa,93195,11/26/2021,1,Saving for the future is always a good thing.  That said the 100% disability is a fairly decent guaranteed lifetime income (thank you for your service) so I would personally prioritize “now” needs (like a house).

hm8dcrg,coberh,11/26/2021,1,> If the check goes un-cashed for 90 days they return the funds to your account.  So is the money in the account or not then? 2020 was 11 months ago.
hm8mw1y,x_driven_x,11/26/2021,1,I got got 2-4 years left and I should hit my CoastFIRE number then I have to concentrate on the brokerage accounts for money I can use before 59.5. So after I hit my number I’ll drop 401k contributions to the match and put the difference in brokerage accounts.  I started late however as I didn’t save anything until 31 and didn’t really get serious about it until 38. I’m about to turn 41. Plan is to semi retire at 47 spend 47-55 working part time (3 or 6mo contract a year) and then not work at all after 55 or take “fun” work like boat captain or something I enjoy that just happens to pay a little spending money.    Every year I hate the rat race more and more so doing more and more to plan to get out of it.

hm7vuwq,Petty-Pendergrass,11/26/2021,1,How you feel about the learning curve?
hm73g8o,boxsterguy,11/26/2021,2,I wonder if there was a bit of a game of telephone happening there?  Anyway yes you should probably consult an estate attorney (probably more relevant here than a tax attorney as estate attorneys are more versed in all the stuff around death and survivor benefits).  The number one rule for survivor benefits is that they must be used for the welfare of the surviving child.  You can do that by paying rent or buying food but if not then the money has to be saved for them (and presumably not in a college-only fund like a 529 according to others here).  Ive heard *anecdotally* that if you are not saving the money directly in the childs name (joint savings account in their name UTMA) and instead saving it separately under your name then the SSA may ask for all of that money back plus any interest it earned *and then it gives the money directly to the child*.  Its not taking away their money.  Its just making sure that you as a custodian are not stealing it from them.  That should all be entirely avoidable if the money is directly in the childs name.  For example Im saving for my kids in their own savings accounts (long term CDs when those used to make sense anyway) and custodial accounts in their names.  So all should be well as the money is theirs in their names and accessible to them when they reach the age of majority.  On a side note the SSA stopped asking for yearly updates on how youre using the money.  Now they just assume youre doing the right thing and presumably will check up on you at the end of their eligibility.  Not that the previous approach was much better as it was just a form where you stated what you did (Saved everything) without any proof required.
hm8pj1a,say592,11/26/2021,327,The scary thing is there are people who are naive enough to do it not to mention elderly people who he could chat up and convince to give up insane amounts of money. A bank teller doesnt risk their job on a whim if they are doing this to OP they have made a conscious decision and are likely doing it to anyone they see as a potential victim.
hm7v3bu,redapoluza,11/26/2021,1,No worries haha thanks anyways. Wish i didnt still owe that but it is what it is
hm6yddz,Will_delete_soon78,11/26/2021,1,I would stay in the house until I decided to move then rent it out! You will own a home and have income. If you sell you have all these fees and taxes to pay.
hm7d4ao,OnlyPostSoUsersXray,11/26/2021,1,Absolutely just like to know what to expect.
hm8h7h2,Headlessstew,11/26/2021,1,I’m personally a fan of driving cars into the proverbial ground but being weather capable in Denver is nice won’t likely get insane snow but ice and slush are liable. Past that it would suck to haul it out to CO and have it crap out on you really soon but do you feel like it could just up and die without notice already? If so it might be more viable to go for a used and reliable AWD but if you think you can get a year or more reliably with your current car that might be the move. Moving is expensive and it almost always feels like it’s more expensive than it originally lines up to be. It would be rough if it crapped out after you dropped the 1200 plus getting new tires but depending on your new job you could maybe manage transit/commute on RTD or light rail until you sort out a new car ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   Outside of that though if you have other expenses or needs that your signing bonus or reloc $ would be used for you may want to weigh those with the options for your vehicle cost EDIT: removed some typos
hm7ag09,metaverse-emperor,11/26/2021,8,Thanks! A very unique answer that puts a lot of clarity to the situation. I really had been looking at it as “right vs wrong stupid vs smart who to believe vs who not to believe” and this reframes the perspective in simple terms about what investing is really about.

hm7ihko,Far-Car,11/26/2021,1,I am not sure about Chase. But with BofA Bill Pay not only they can tell me if the check has been cashed. They can also followup with the payee.  And if the payment somehow did not made it the bank will cover the late fees and interest.
hm8izbl,ApartPersonality1520,11/26/2021,1,Im looking for a career in the intelligence field. Graduated with a bachelors in poly-sci. Is there a career pathway for intelligence thats purely work based or does everybody have to go through bootcamp?  Sorry if this is stupid.
hm7tuum,tlollz52,11/26/2021,1,I know  a guy who bought  a nice ass mustang with his enlistment bonus and then totaled it within  a month  of having  it. He had to drive a POS for awhile  not sure what he drives now but probably  not anything  that great.
hm8opm4,Nagisan,11/26/2021,2,I follow the 50/30/20 rule...I also dont spend 50% on bills/needs.    Instead its probably closer to 40/30/30 for me.    I use it as a general rule of what to not exceed for my needs and the wants/savings adjust however I please after the needs are met. So if like me you arent spending 50% on needs the leftover goes to wants/savings however you choose to spend it.
hm84tfa,Lotusluv09,11/26/2021,1,Check and see if there’s a local area agency on aging. They would be able to assist with a good amount of this stuff if she qualifies (I feel like she probably would) you could also sign her up for medicaid. Both of these things might take some time but still start the process! And definitely speak with social worker.
hm7ksa2,amish__,11/26/2021,1,Why did you sell the property in the first place? You really should have gotten advice before making the decision.  You need to sit down with someone to first and foremost ensure that your personal finances are in order such that they are reliable enough to meet your lifestyle needs for the remainder of your life. That will give you an indication about how much money you may be able to gift to your children before you even consider the taxation implications.
hm8apy8,Gotanis55,11/26/2021,1,It seems to me that riding the wave doesnt seem to be an option given the situation (unless I want to give up the house Im in the process of purchasing). The reason Im selling is because I am using the money for the down payment on a house. It was a poor idea to make an offer on a house before having the down payment in cash but I didnt want to jump the gun in case my offer was rejected.  But thats the position Im in now in any case.   Basically the stocks are getting sold for time-sensitive reason completely unrelated to the market dipping. If I werent selling them to pay for the down payment Id just ride the wave (or better yet find some extra cash to buy more stocks now).    Unless Im missing an idea it seems like Im between either selling now as was the plan to begin with before things started to dip or hang on for a short amount of time (probably at most two weeks. I would need to sell the stocks and then wire cash into my bank account before the closing).
hm7en7i,vrtigo1,11/26/2021,1,That seems like a really bad idea.  My understanding is that if you walk into a branch and get a cashiers check and then lose that check youre out the funds.  So wouldnt the same apply if the check they send gets lost in the mail?  Any idea why they do it this way vs just sending a normal check?
hm7h5cj,PSYKO_Inc,11/26/2021,1,There are a lot of comments already and I havent read everything yet but a couple things have jumped out at me so far.  You always want to max your 401k match at the minimum. With that being said at 52k annual 6 percent is $3120/yr or $260/mo. The difference between contributing 3% and 6% is $130/mo. Actually a bit less than that since taxes would be deferred but I digress. Are you telling me that $130/mo is the difference between go/no-go in your budget?  If this is the case you have bigger problems to worry about. You are already at the ragged edge financially and need to seriously re-examine your budget. $130 is a simple common emergency like a flat tire or a power outage causing the food in the refrigerator to go bad. You should always leave a little extra in the budget for things like that so you arent dipping into savings (which is there for big emergencies like unemployment major home/car repairs etc.) for every little hiccup.  YOU MUST REDUCE EXPENSES! At 52k income figuring for ~20% deductions for federal/state/FICA/Medicare and another 6% for 401k you are left with about $3200/mo. If youre spending $3k youre stretching yourself too thin. Where can you make some room? If its a car payment sell the car and get something cheaper because you cant afford it. If its housing same thing. Move somewhere cheaper or get a roommate because you cant afford it. Food? Avoid restaurants cook for yourself. Saving $10 a day by bringing lunch to work instead of hitting the local lunch spots is an extra $300 a month in your pocket.   Its really easy to let small seemingly insignificant purchases add up. Use something like Mint to figure out what you are spending on determine if its a trend and adjust your habits accordingly.  I understand that my comments here may come off a little bit harsh and I dont want you to think Im calling you out on it Im just trying to give you the wake-up call that you may need to make some changes before you end up over your head.
hm74mvy,UtopianLibrary,11/26/2021,1,They’re looking for money laundering to make sure your down payment is legit. They might also be looking for proof of direct deposit paychecks.   Source:I used to no a loan processor.
hm76dx1,j0nnyc92,11/26/2021,2,Im in the Army and have been in the regular army and in Special Operations. The Army can be a great stepping stone to move up in the world financially. You can learn skills that will translate to outside work (MOS dependent) and you can save and make a lot of money while youre in. The GI bill is an excellent tool to help pay for college and you will get a rather large stipend to pay for food and housing while in school. Joining the Army for 4 years can be worth it. It can also not if youre responsible about what you do with your time or finances.
hm8qvi6,MuddyGrimes,11/26/2021,129,Definitely a chance the teller is doing exactly this and just phishing for people the same way they did to OP.   Wonder how many people have given money to the teller
hm8tvsb,Chicken-n-Biscuits,11/26/2021,47,In 1999 I made $7.50/hour working as a teller at a regional bank in Louisiana which was at least $1 more per hour than I earned working at a clothing store called Structure at the the same time and $2.35 (46%) more than minimum wage at the time. That said there are lots of “uppity” people who work in the lowest ranks of what they consider to be grand institutions (e.g. retail banking law offices luxury retail).
hm8gjuk,sugarbanana,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for letting me know that!
hm891jj,adoredactive,11/26/2021,1,That’s what’s confusing yes. I did finance 1 car and it’s been paid off for over a year now though. And it shows under “closed accounts” . And it’s name is credit acceptance. So I don’t understand this GMAC thing

hm87g1s,PM_ME_YOUR_CALICOS,11/26/2021,1,Youre going to need an independent mechanic to take a look at it and do whats called a pre-purchase inspection. Do not pass go without this do not pass go if theres major issues and do not pass go just because the seller says hes taking care of it.  Other than that the car is worth significantly less. When you go to trade it in or sell it later no private party or dealer is going to be thrilled to see the salvage title. This isnt a concern if you keep it til it does or is worthless anyway.  A deer hit isnt the worst thing. Again just need an independent set of knowledgeable eyes on it.
hm75ij4,unchinhairs,11/26/2021,1,There are lots of meal kit services with varying cooking requirements. Some come with everything pre-measured you just cook it yourself. Others come with the entire meal already prepared you just heat it up. Similarly you can often buy prepared food at a grocery store. Check out the frozen section as well so you have meals that can be eaten anytime. There are also many quick sides that you can put together so that you have staples at the ready with minimal effort. Minute rice and frozen broccoli have been my staples for when I am too drained to cook at all.  You can take it slow. Grub Hub can become a habit if you do it for every single meal so I wouldnt expect you to immediately quit. Give yourself a goal to reduce your ordering habit over time.  Lastly if you do deliver try to optimize. Often when I get delivery I will order enough for multiple meals. Some meals I can easily stretch with things I have at home. Like I will cook some rice heat up a frozen vegetable in the microwave and make my delivery leftover last an extra meal.

hm8k686,kutes,11/26/2021,1,No Im sorry this is completely on that teller. Ive neevr even heard of something like this its bizarre to me. If hes willing to do this who knows if hes got some weird shit on the go with peoples accounts. He needs to not be involved with peoples finances in anyway shape or form.  Hes already broken Os trust and given him stress this is massively inconvenient.  Maybe he will get a labor job that at least pays decently like the rest of people that dont want to make minimum wage and 30 hours a week.  Seriously what a bizarre thing to do.
hm75bhy,lost_in_life_34,11/26/2021,2,if you clock out early many systems will round it down to the previous half hour or so not the exact time. if youre on a time clock then either put in full hours or wait to clock out after the proper time
hm8i0df,LiteBulb88,11/26/2021,1,Buy low and sell high not the other way around. So if the market does go into a significant correction you should be looking to buy not sell. Of course if you have to sell to afford the house you want then you shouldnt be too worried about how much youre gaining or losing--a house is an investment that is almost guaranteed to go up.

hm8t0k7,jRqGv,11/26/2021,3,Its likely this guy is just a scammer but Im gonna be charitable for a minute and say the teller might have been hacked.  I can think of a number of ways someone in or near the bank could have hacked the tellers smartphone.  If thats the case the bank should still be notified so that the teller can lock down his email smartphone and other accounts. And the bank can lock down their wifi security in the public areas.

hm7w8s3,Anonymoose2021,11/26/2021,1,Normally bonuses are withheld at a 22% rate.   So Bonus 1 would be $66.8k bonus 2 is $55k and bonus 3 is $9k for a total of bonuses of little over $130k.    So are your incomes of $56k and $150k including or excluding bonuses?    The numbers dont add up.  Either your total income is more than you said or you are grossly over withholding.
hm899b5,CaptainNayak,11/26/2021,1,Yes of course :) that’s great. Thank you so much for the information! 🤗
hm86593,kiLLxander,11/26/2021,1,What’s really the move is putting less away in retirement accounts and more into your own personal investments. Like ETFs real estate crypto (relatively) passive cash flowing businesses.  Someone worth a lot of money said to me once “Rich people don’t put money away for retirement.”  That stuck with me.   Anyways just 2 cents from a not millionaire.

hm70dhp,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,So not sure what to tell you. If you cant make the payments then you stop paying. Clean it up later before you come back home.  You could do credit counseling agency which would lower your interest but still require some sort of smaller payment.  You can file bankruptcy while you are out of the country but that will cause 10 years of credit damage.

I’ve had over 20 used cars the only thing I kept for more then 3 years is a new Nissan Frontier that I bought.   I bought it new because it was exactly what I needed. Truck 4x4 comfortable and can tow up to 6000lbs.   It was worth it. It’s a 2016 I have 161k on it now. Perfect vehicle

hm8qwm3,Least-Love,11/26/2021,16,I was in a similar situation when I was in college after getting out of the military. I worked  a full-time night shift job went to school full-time during the day and worked a second part-time job on the weekends. I was struggling financially but getting by without taking on debt.   One morning I was driving home from work fell asleep at the wheel and drove my car into a telephone pole. I was ejected from the passenger side window of the vehicle and broke my collar bone shoulder blade and ankle. I also had lacerations on my face and leg that required stitches. I’m lucky I survived and that I didn’t kill or injure anyone else. My car was totaled and I was sore for weeks. It was a huge setback. After the accident I quit the weekend job and cut back my course load. It took a bit longer to graduate but it I still graduated debt free.  IMHO your plan may work for a semester or so but something’s got to give. I don’t think you should take on additional debt. Maybe cut back your course load and move out your graduation date. It will take longer but life will suck a lot less during that time. You may even want to invest some of your “extra” time to find higher paying jobs or jobs that offer tuition reimbursement.
hm6zic9,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,If You claim exemption from withholding then that means you expect to owe zero taxes to Michigan. Like you dont even have to file for Michigan.   Doesnt sound like that is the case. So dont choose that exemption
hm877er,rooski616,11/26/2021,1,Most on this sub will automatically advocate for the retirement savings free money but there definitely are exceptions such as yours.  You need to make sure you can live now to take advantage of the retirement savings later. Get somewhat comfortable now then go after the employer match. Just make sure you are smart about it in the short term so you start taking advantage as soon as possible.
hm74qb1,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,> Any tips or advice on how to continue down this path and not get trooped up?  You can schedule a payment from your bank account to pay the same amount to your credit card to get the effect that money is gone faster so you dont overspend.

hm8jtfm,kutes,11/26/2021,1,This kind of thinking is why those neighbourhoods are so terrible.  Man though what a bizarre situation.

hm74nte,exconsultingguy,11/26/2021,1,You make over $200k/year and are paying taxes on your retirement contributions now meaning you expect to spend even more it retirement. Seems very strange to me. You’ve already got your Roth IRA so I’d split the two. Having access to pre and post tax buckets may be very helpful later in life.   Short of that you’re saving a ton and shouldn’t have any problem saving for vacations or a rental property. Without your budget it’s impossible to really give advice.

We made the payments for the remainder of the loan period at least one year from what I remember.
hm8e3ri,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,I live in the west coast no way I can find a home with out added income history. It’s brutal over here. Everyone’s getting out bid. Houses are expensive.
hm7r788,wild_b_cat,11/26/2021,1,Thats your withholding not your taxes. Its what your company *thinks* youll need to pay in taxes which suggests you havent filled out your W-4 correctly.   If you need help figuring out specifically whats wrong post your actual numbers from your most recent paystub and we can help pinpoint the problem.
hm7idu3,SuggestionDistinct51,11/26/2021,1,I dont finance my cars. The vehicles I buy dont typically depreciate and if that doesnt make sense to you think about it. Im not rich but I love cars. 👱‍♀️
hm8ijjd,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,They only get a specific exclusion. Any gains about that are still taxed. Their is no 121 exclusion for car gains.
hm7xwdf,Pixilatedlemon,11/26/2021,1,Haha some people like that stuff no joke
hm8iegn,93195,11/26/2021,1,That’s my concern too.  Charge a bunch of $99 “lifetime” memberships to collect cash now then abruptly change the deal a few months from now (which the terms and conditions allow them to do) that makes the membership worthless.  $7/mo or $99 “lifetime”?  Just feels like it’s begging people to get the lifetime.  Which makes me question why…..color me skeptical.
hm7bvm5,tuxed,11/26/2021,1,Make sure you have an emergency fund first. Since your income is unpredictable I would ensure you have at least 6 months of expenses.  Save as much as you can after expenses. Here you don’t want to work off percentages but rather absolute dollar amounts.
hm8izv4,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,That argument wont work here because it was from a business. So in order for it to be a gift of equity the parents would have had to claim the full value at time of transfer as taxable comp from the business. Which they didnt. It was actually not tax law compliant what they did only claiming 50.00 of depreciation recapture at that time. However now op has to pay the taxes that the parents should have at that time but as capital gains instead of the depreciation recapture rate it should have been.
hm7k5q2,CoolNebraskaGal,11/26/2021,1,Distributions from Inherited IRAs are taxed as income. There is no early withdrawal penalty. If this pension plan allows it to be transferred to an Inherited IRA that is probably the best option. But you can only do this as a direct transfer. If the pension requires a lump sum payout this will not be an option. It really depends on the pension (defined benefit? Defined contribution?)  In general you can not convert traditional Inherited IRA to Roth as a non spouse. But you could conceivably receive this money tax free from the pension. You need to look at the specific pension plan info. I believe the IRS info you are quoting only specifies Roth because you can inherit pretax and post tax accounts. You cannot just choose Roth it has to be a Roth eligible direct transfer to a Roth Inherited IRA.
hm7al30,teachmethr0waway,11/26/2021,1,Not currently. Am just starting to look into the different ways.
hm81ehf,woollywhelk,11/26/2021,1,If you’re saying that you’ve fully funded the account like to support their entire education costs then I really wouldn’t stress about the possible ding from FAFSA. Might be misinterpreting what you’re saying though.  I’m pro having one account per child there are a couple of good reasons. 1 it’s going to be a lot easier to manage if your children will receiving distributions from the funds at the same time. 2 many parents opt to use target date funds so with two accounts you can have different risk levels depending on your timeline. 3 if you ever wanted to contribute more than $15k in a single year you can avoid gift tax by contributing to multiple accounts.
hm788cd,epinephrine90,11/26/2021,2,Yeah it constitutes fraud… especially if it looks deceiving  Is boosting your credit score just a tad bit due to increase in AAoA really that necessary to possibly think about the consequences of fraud?.   They will figure it out soon enough a family member died in march… by May chase BofA Discover NFCU Golden1cu all closed the accounts that had 120k+ in CL.   Discover asked my cousin if he wanted to switch the account to his name he declined.
hm8qhaj,lostharbor,11/26/2021,266,Im not going to lie this type of audacity doesnt even surprise me anymore. Anything for a buck now at the expence of their future. I dont understand what is happening within the culture because I cant recollect a time 10-20 years ago where this behaviour would happen. Maybe because social media makes it so much easier to see?  I worked with a guy making $150k-$200k a year with a promising track ahead and he dumped his future for a one-time insider trade for $50k. **$50K** to ruin his life for the rest of his existence. He blackballed himself from every company for $50K.   I honestly can not compute that insanity.
hm7d941,rallyally,11/26/2021,1,By we get nowhere I mean that the HR person will tell me that they will look into it and to fill out a “ticket” (like an IT ticket) and then the next day they say they have no update but then the same thing all over “fill out a ticket and someone will look into it”

hm6xp3b,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,4,Some banks may leave the money until the check is cashed but most take the money right away and treat it like a cashiers check instead of a personal check.
hm8f0pr,claytonsprinkles,11/26/2021,1,OP you can most certainly see if the check was paid in your online bill pay history on chase.com. Now if it’s showing as paid and the endorsement on the back isn’t the landlord’s you should file a claim that the check was apparently stolen.  It’s not the most painless process but ultimately you should be able to get your money back.  Edit: the people you spoke to were they branch based or from online banking support? Branch based bankers have very little visibility with online bill pay and the general customer service line might not have been trained on the details of online bill pay. You’ll want to make sure you talk to chase online banking support specifically. Their number is on chase’s “contact us page”.
hm8jca9,ShahOfQC,11/26/2021,1,You’re better off getting an HM Bradley HYSA its 3% up to $100000 and you just have to keep 80% of your direct deposit in it to maintain the rate. This is what i will be doing since Porte is adding extra requirements come year end.
hm6ums8,Aleyla,11/26/2021,1,You have a fair amount of work ahead of you.       Go to a site like cars.com.  Find your vehicle get as close to it as possible - year mileage features even color.  Try to find 3 or so for sale.   Average their prices and that should give you an idea of what yours is worth.       $20k of damage is quite a bit and it will likely be totaled.  When the insurance company gives you their offer ask them for the “comps”. That stands for comparables.  This is what their offer is going to be based on.  If the value they offer isn’t roughly what you found in your research then push back for more.        Good luck.
hm8ivh6,iOS34,11/26/2021,1,The mobile home itself will depreciate in value. Like someone else said if it is sitting on land the land that you own as well it will appreciate.
hm77me8,crazy_rex40k,11/26/2021,1,>Small landlords get a lot of shit on Reddit. Im still not sure why.   Because any landlord small or big has a LOT of power over your life. Small landlords often treat it as a passive side income and dont expect to live up to their end of the deal.      Ive had a landlord steal my damage deposit (no damage said shed return it just never did stopped answering my calls) and another whom I rented a room from for ten months who forgot that it was a 10 month lease and kicked me out after eight months to move in new tenants.      Real glad to own my own place now and never have to deal with that sorta thing again.
hm7wr1z,gubbabubbagump,11/26/2021,1,100% correct. Thank you so much for your advice.
hm8kdod,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,1,I’ve been banking with this bank since I opened my first account at 14 years old and have never had a problem. I don’t have any concerns keeping my money at this bank going forward as long as this is handled.
hm892oy,jgbro,11/26/2021,1,I didn’t see you answer what the interest is on your student loans? That would be my deciding factor on how quickly to repay them. You definitely need a little emergency fund too but do you live at home with your parents? If so you don’t need as much as someone with their own house. I don’t think you provided enough information to answer this correctly.
hm6v997,joey_subie,11/26/2021,5,House is worth roughly 300k in current market I am currently living in it now I should have made that more clear haha.   It is a nice place although since I am 24 and I want to leave the state of GA  it definitely isnt somewhere I see myself living for too long.   &#x200B  Just paid my prop taxes about $2.7k utilities arent bad at all just a few hundred and I pay $42 monthly for home warranty.  &#x200B   I am beyond appreciative of the house but it was a surprise inheritance and my grandpa was not in contact with me for my entire life essentially so not much sentimental value that would make it hard to leave if that makes sense.
hm8rlog,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,3,Unfortunately the key word is individual.  If the parents had given the car to them for $50 the rest of the value of the car would be considered a gift.  But since it was a business it is not considered a gift and their cost basis is $50 instead of fair market value on the date they bought it.
hm7a2un,Uniqueiamjustjules,11/26/2021,1,This x1000. Everyone I know who got the most out of their military service planned it out. Theyll get out of you what they want but you need to reciprocate the same planning.  It can work out quite well if done with forethought.   Most of the successful millennials I know served 4+ years. The most successful discharged at 12+. I think were just entering the full 20+ service and many of those will be set for life when they pivot into civilian life.
hm6tab5,josuhph,11/26/2021,3,Open a Roth IRA assuming they’re under the income limits it’d be super simple and have no tax implications.

hm8lwhj,Not_A_Referral_Link,11/26/2021,1,I had a horrible experience with a salvage / rebuilt car. Everything looked fine but eventually the hood and front fenders rusted ac quit working turn signal lights become corroded bottom radiator mount rusted out (I kept it held up for years with a 2X4 and ratchet strap (probably not the safest idea). I felt it wasn’t safe to drive because who know what other crappy work they did.  I would only buy a salvage / rebuilt vehicle if there are detailed photos of the damage and a detailed list of the very things that was fixed and even then I would skeptical.
hm7y5i2,Reddevil313,11/26/2021,1,Auto pay checks will send but if not cashed within about 90 Days the funds get returned.
hm7f4b6,withfries,11/26/2021,1,It is how some banks like chase handle it. I agree it has the properties of a cashiers check but it isnt. It is more like a check (i.e. less secure than cashiers check)
hm8f1lh,ThisIsAMonere,11/26/2021,1,Just like there is federal capital gains taxes on literally anything you buy for a low price and sell for a higher price not just cars.  OP you are correct.  You bought an item for $50 and then you sell it for $5000 then yes those earnings are subject to capital gains taxes.  The fact that it’s a car is irrelevant. It’s that you bought something for a low price and sold it for a higher price.

hm8144r,w33dcup,11/26/2021,1,Maybe were saying the same thing. I have 1 account and in that account are 3 investments tracks each with a defined beneficiary 1 for each child.  The ease comes from the kids being different ages and thus on different reallocation schedules.  Since they each have their own track I dont have to log in at any point to change anything.  I just automated a monthly xfer to the account and let it ride.
hm7t0dy,jailguard81,11/26/2021,1,If u want to go to college for free try the reserves or guard. u can go to any state college for free. or if u just want to collect pay checks army isn’t too bad. You lose a little bit of freedom but if money is your priority then it’s still isn’t bad. Most people don’t like it. They usually leave after 1st contract 4-6 years. if your already thinking about it I should just do it. Try finding a MOS you’re interested in
hm78w4l,Aiorr,11/26/2021,0,There is really no minimum payment in student loanv(unless you sign up for specific repayment plan like income-based) and grace period / covid forgiveness complicates this.    And I advised OP to pay even tiny bit monthly a pseudo-minimum payment.  Not making dent would imply not even paying those bit.

hm8gv3w,Shikyoookami,11/26/2021,1,As someone who used to work for a call center in the bank let me tell this is a big problem. He took it upon himself to message you a complete stranger to ask for money. When I was working for the bank I could easily access any account I wanted to just needed the account number or some other details you honestly didn’t need to be there for me to do anything. While everything is monitored it doesn’t stop him from gaining access to your account if he wanted to.  You did the right thing transferring your money out to another account first thing tomorrow would be go down to the branch and speak to the branch manager. You may need to open a new account with a new account number but I would speak to the branch manager first and see what they recommend also if you do any online banking change your information like your login ID and password just to be safe about. Keep an eye on your credit and possibly you may want to consider freezing it just so you don’t run the risk of anything happening our systems would allow me to look at your social security number this is the only reason I’m suggesting it. Your bank may be different than where I worked which was Bank of America but better safe than sorry.
hm89gla,vinegarstrokes1,11/26/2021,1,This is very common and most people forget to go back in and remove the homestead exemption
hm7uyii,Phoenix2683,11/26/2021,1,For a year maybe thats ok but every financial planner will tell you time in the market is the most important thing. You cant gain back time in the market.  Think of this. If they give dollar for dollar match. Its a 100% return on investment immediately. Where else can you get that return?
hm7za51,One-Kind-Word,11/26/2021,1,Because: The property is on the west side of the country and I and my daughters live on the east side. Because: I’m getting older with some health problems. Because: It’s been hard finding comp properties and my daughters would have an even harder time since it’s a 20 acre piece with a creek running along the west border. A creek that only runs 9 months of the year but it means wells in the area don’t have to be deep saving money. Any property in Arizona with any creek is rather special.  I have 3 potential buyers even though I’ve never put it on the open market. If I listed it the commission on raw land is 10% and I don’t think any offer would bring in much more. It is an unknown though. The buyer I’ve accepted is an abutting neighbor.  The last reason is because I would get a kick out of giving my daughters some funds while I’m alive. I still own 31 acres in the northwestern area of Arizona and I want to put that in trust for my kids. That will be easier to sell.
hm7cgg4,FarioLimo,11/26/2021,4,You see your father as a safety net but maybe hes telling you in a friendly way that you should take care of your life like the adult you are. Which means not run to them and control your finances.  He seems Iike a very reasonable person.
hm8tq63,kushhcommander,11/26/2021,1,If you need a car/truck you need to buy one.  Bumming off of your moms car that is borderline broken is not the way to get ahead in life.  Get a new reliable car the resale market is in your favor.  You dont go buy a used car/truck and wish you spent a few thousand more dollars for new.  The chances are high your resale value will hold very well over the next few years.  There wont be a market correction car dealerships are salivating over the new car sales culture and new cars have better value.
hm6skk4,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,0,Its not defrauding the government because those hours were worked.  It not legally compensating your employees for hours worked and billed.
hm8czol,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,No it’s not. If you buy a car and increase the value of the car then it would be capital gains taxed. This dude did nothing to increase the value. He just bought it for cheaper then it was worth.
hm7bvek,Aiorr,11/26/2021,1,I would assume Dad wont really appreciate not listening to his advice while still resorting to him as backup.  My take is that Dad wants OP to start learning financial responsibility independence and judgment.

hm8gfm9,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,If you bought the car from some random person for $50 and sold it for $5000 you would owe capital gains tax on $4950.  This is because your cost basis would be $50 so everything above $50 is profit.  But you were sold the car for $50 by your parents and given a gift of equity for the difference between what the car was worth and $50.  So as long as the car was worth more then $5000 when your parents gifted you the equity in the car you wont owe taxes.  If the car was worth more then the gift tax exclusion limit in the year they gifted you equity in the car then they should have filed gift tax forms with their taxes but otherwise there is no paper trail needed for this.
hm83rx4,TrumpsBoneSpur,11/26/2021,1,Call your insurance company and tell them what happened.  You can get an estimate for the damages (should be free) and then decide if you want to submit a claim.
hm6sjfw,Gesha24,11/26/2021,2,Bonus is not something that you should count on when budgeting. I would budget based on how much you take home each month. See how much you can afford of monthly payments. Then go to calculator and see how much of a car you can afford with down payment (make sure you have accounted for taxes and about $500 worth of registration fees whatever else sales guy add on it).  Once you have the number - look around what you can buy for it. Right now market is terrible and most of cars outside of premium segment are overpriced. If you find something you like - you buy it. If not - you wait for bonus so you can make bigger down payment or for better market so that cheap cars are cheaper.
hm85n41,nevia1974,11/26/2021,1,Dont get talked into anything chemical either.   Find lucrative civilian jobs and match it to a MOS.  GET IT ALL IN WRITING BEFORE YOU SIGN.  Trick they like to use : a general MOS number and plug you into any MOS.
hm7r322,fedupandalone,11/26/2021,1,Ah I understand great. Thank you
hm7os74,cmgr33n3,11/26/2021,1,I would try to convert this into real amounts look at those amounts and the role they play in my life and then decide which I thought was more important for its role (or if some % of both was the better option). Both the actual amounts and the different roles (cash on hand in savings vs retirement savings) are important in making the decision. Below is an attempt at determining the actual amounts you would be considering.  Retirement:  * 401K contributions are pre-tax so $52000 / 12 = $4333.33 per month x 2% (0.02) = $86.66    * This is how much per month comes out of your earning for every 2% you funnel into your retirement (so multiply by 2 for 4% or 3 for 6%). * $86.66 x 2 (company match) = $173.33    * This is how much per month actually would be deposited into your retirement account for every 2% you funnel into your retirement account (dont add bullet 1 and 2 together that would be a double match) * At even a conservative 5% return (fyi: this is a more concervative rate than I use for my own thought experiments like this) that $173 a month (assuming you continued to save/invest it in your 401k the entire time) would be:    * $2133 after 1 year ($1039.92 from your salary $1039.92 from the companys the match $53.16 from investment earnings)    * $4375 after 2 years ($2079.84 from your salary $2079.84 from the companys the match $215.32 from investment earnings)    * $11 814 after 5 years ($5199.60 from your salary $5199.60 from the companys the match $1414.80 from investment earnings)  Savings:  * Putting money in a savings account is after-tax money.  And because taxes work in brackets rather than flat overall rates it takes a little work to figure out what percentage of that $86.66 per month in earnings youd actually be putting into a savings account (the reality is a little more complex than just deducting your fed taxes but IMO this gets you close enough for making a decision).    * At $52000 per year you pay $4664 in taxes on your first $40525 in earnings and 22% on the last $11475. $11475 x 22% (0.22) = $2524.50.  Your total federal income tax bill would then be $4664 + - $2524.50 = $7188.50.    * Your total federal income tax bill ($7188.50) divided by your total income ($52000) is your effective tax rate which is the percentage of tax you pay per dollar you earn. $7188.50 / $52000 = 13.82%    * $86.88 x 13.82% (0.1382) = $11.98. So you pay $11.98 on every $86.88 you earn meaning you keep $74.90 (lets just round that to $75.00) * Savings accounts are typically between 0-1% APY (annual percentage yeild so how much interest accrued in a 12 month span). Putting $75 a month into a savings account at 1% APY results in following (again assuming you continue to save that amount the entire time):    * $905 after 1 year ($900 from your salary $5 from savings interest)    * $1819 after 2 years ($1800 from your salary $19 from savings interest)    * $4616 after 5 yeas ($4500 from your salary $116 from savings interest)  The calculations above were reached using the information you provided [a listing of the federal income tax brackets for 2021](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets) and a [basic compound interest calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/compound-savings-calculator-tool.aspx).
hm8hua4,xtc46,11/26/2021,1,By your same logic the person at corporate could also be shady and in on it it could be a vast conspiracy to steal money from customers!  Best to call the FBI.
hm836zc,epinephrine90,11/26/2021,1,Call them? I recently called Discover on a $4000 balance and settled it for $1600.   They offered $2600 I told them I can pay $1600 if we settle it today the lady checked if she could accept with manager came back and said we will take it!   I called US Bank to settle $43k on a credit card settled it at $14k I know obviously there’s tax implications but we will deal with that when the time comes.   Call them!  As for a PFD If it’s charged off and the issuing bank is TD (I think?) I’m not sure they’ll accept a PFD.. as I’ve tried with Discover US Bank Barclays Synchrony and no banks do PFD…. Usually only Debt purchasers
hm6x3x3,Gavilan_y_Paloma,11/26/2021,2,So in this case I most likely will not keep this vehicle after repairs. That being said would it be more profitable to simply have them give me a check for the value of the vehicle?
hm6ubky,parkinsonblack,11/26/2021,1,Ok one more question isnt selling from an IRA a taxable event? When you say cash you mean the money in the settlement fund that gets withdrawn into my bank account right?      I went ahead and converted half of the amount into my Roth but now Im thinking because my income is so low this year (I was unemployed several months) I may as well just convert the other half and bite the bullet on the taxes which will probably be \~$1k. (Rollover amount = $9000. Income = sub-40k)
hm7mkjk,oledawgnew,11/26/2021,1,I too recommend NewRetirement. I believe it has more financial modeling and forecasting options than personal capital ynab and mint.
hm8bh79,pridkett,11/26/2021,1,Thats not the way that every bank does it. I had Chase set up this way for a long time - but stopped a few years ago when I stopped having a rental place. Chase debited the account as soon as the check was mailed because the check withdrew from a different account. In that sense the person getting the check was receiving something they could nearly guarantee was good.  My current bank does the same thing. Debits my account as soon as the check is cut.
hm7ph4v,wearitout222,11/26/2021,1,Update: i got offered $7000 more than what i owe!!! I got offered 19600 and I owe 12500!! Thank you so much everyone for helping me. I had no idea it was that simple and the market was this good rn! So my next move is buy a used van to travel this should help :)
hm8l1lg,NerfherdersWoman,11/26/2021,1,I would agree that some trades that are unionized may be harder to enter but dude theres so many other trades than pipefitting and I dont know about you but Id rather bust my butt to join a union than go places and shoot innocent people for G.O.D. just to pay for school. There should be another choice. I think a lot of people forget about AmeriCorps and trades are not only viable but for some people more desirable alternatives. While I support those who serve respectfully and honorably always. I do think there ought to be more options than risking your life physical and mental health to pay for school.
hm72lyx,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,It means the former employer can still turn the loan into an early withdrawal but the new laws let him pay it back like a normal 401k rollover until Oct 2022.
hm807zn,Reddevil313,11/26/2021,1,My bank will automatically void uncashed checks after 90 Days and return funds  I remember getting some random $50 deposit and not knowing what it was for and then for an angry call a week later from some guy I owed $50 because the check bounced despite it saying void after 90 Days on the check.
hm7p1iu,PaulR504,11/26/2021,1,I assume this is prompted by people posting these famcy vacations or trips online and you feel like you are missing out?   From my experience a lot of that is debt financed and few and far between. You are doing the right thing no matter how odd it seems.
hm77y1p,metaverse-emperor,11/26/2021,10,Monthly expenses would have been good to include. I live in an expensive city so I spend about $3K per month after rent groceries entertainment etc. I technically could not survive for longer than 3 weeks on my current savings but my parents live nearby are well-off and have a good relationship with me so they’d always be there to help me out in an emergency. (Not that I want to rely on that though.) If I contributed 6% it’d be a bit slower to grow savings but it would still be growth.
hm6uofp,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,5,Look into holding onto the check for the moment and hold off on adding her to the account. Look into the possibility of an ABLE account or some other instrument for a disabled adult.  Your sister isnt wrong about SSI.   Heres another possibility...  https://www.specialneedsalliance.org/the-voice/utilizing-the-spend-down-option-to-maintain-ssi-andor-medicaid-eligibility-2/
hm7m3mz,CoeusDarksoul,11/26/2021,1,Billpay services are not all the same. Generally speaking Billpay only sends via ACH if the recipient is setup to receive ACHes and not all Billpay services have the same criteria for how the recipients qualify. Some only accept registered companies some only accept business accounts with routing+acct numbers provided by the sender some let you send via ACH regardless. If the recipient cannot receive ACH for any of the above reasons or something related to how their Financial Institution handles ACHes then BillPay will send a paper check. Again this fluctuates based on service/FI and they may be setup to pre-debit or debit directly from the senders account when the physical check is cashed. Those arent even all of the options there are multiple BillPay service providers and each of them have multiple various service packages with different features & functionality.  Please dont assume your experience is ubiquitous and state it as fact.  Source: Worked 15 years in banking with 4 in Operations including multiple BillPay service conversions involving multiple service providers and analysis and evaluation of their various service packages and what features are & arent available.
hm7473w,trsmith83,11/26/2021,2,Usually the lender is owned by the manufacturer. So they see it as a cost of selling cars.
hm87fob,polar_nopposite,11/26/2021,1,The worth as your describing is irrelevant. The worth is the price paid.
hm88edu,hjthrone,11/26/2021,1,I appreciate the information. Very helpful.
hm87yix,WoodsFinder,11/26/2021,1,You have to make your own decision of course but what I would do for myself is set up payroll deduction into the companys 401k (if they have one) for at least the amount that they match because that match is basically free money. Then Id contribute to a Roth IRA if I could do so and still afford my bills and be able to have some fun.  Id invest the money in both into a broad-based stock index fund (S&P 500 Russell 2000 or a mid-cap fund).
hm756ux,vulcanjedi2814,11/26/2021,1,He didn’t close. I’m sure he can still walk and whatever earnest money / penalty would still be worth it.
hm7bqf5,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,General rule of thumb is 20% (15% for retirement and another 5% for general savings). Read the [Prime Directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)
hm7fxn1,mtcwby,11/26/2021,1,Always take free money and the difference in your paycheck is pretty small. Youll be amazed at the power of compounding 20 years from now.
hm8k4n6,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,I figured if my for fun degree didn’t work out I’d end up going to that side if things with my GI bill  It’s good money but I figured why not go passion first  Penniless passion haha
hm8o6x0,monarch1733,11/26/2021,7,Lol. One creep at one branch location is no reason to fear the entire US banking system. Calm down.
hm75hqo,Redmamba_24,11/26/2021,1,Have you looked at transferring some of those balances to new cards that have 0 percent interest on balance transfers for a certain time frame usually 12-18 months.
hm6vvob,zacce,11/26/2021,3,Quicken can give you cash flow forecast but you have to enter all the future income bills.
hm8eacm,Cejvo7,11/26/2021,1,Ive been doing well on it so far. Up around 35% all time. Ive been putting in since I was like 21.
hm74w3k,Jsand117,11/26/2021,10,This is definitely fraud. Once the person has passed the card and contract is no longer valid. Executors don’t have a right to utilize or accrue debt under the deceased persons name. This is illegal.  I’m surprised a deceased alert/notification hasn’t gone out yet. But I guess no one has reported it?  Just a few articles for you to consider  https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-happens-to-credit-card-debt-when-you-die/  https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/business_credit_card-debt-authorized_user-spouse-death-1585/  “Stop using credit cards on which you are an authorized user. Using a credit card after the primary cardholders death is considered fraud even if you are an authorized user. Thats why its a good idea for each spouse to be the primary cardholder on at least one credit card.”
hm85ebn,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,Its capital gains in Ops situation. 100%. This is exactly capital gains and every time you register a vehicle the sale price is recorded.  Go ahead link your source.
hm78zo8,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,4,Most banks dont even collect the SSN and addresses for AUs. You could create an AU card named Mickey Mouse.    AUs are not liable for anything.   So no they dont have to notify you.... because its not supposed to cause any problems for you
hm6wfpj,personalfinanceta5,11/26/2021,1,I have a bed. Definitely looking to add a couch. Thinking about upgrading my mattress.  The main luxuries I’m looking at are nice speakers a fancy cordless vacuum and a nice couch. All of these should be easy to keep for the long haul except maybe the couch.
hm7nrl2,Ainoskedoyu,11/26/2021,1,Look into Army/Air Guard. Pick your job in advance and you dont move arrive so you could still act as caretaker. Its one weekend a month so you should be able to work toward another job in the industry or degree if you want to go that route
hm73pf6,nothlit,11/26/2021,5,Yes it is possible. At a minimum this would probably involve registering a DBA (doing business as alias or trade name) or some other type of corporate entity such as an LLC. You could then set up the business bank account in that name.
hm8pd3b,GaylrdFocker,11/26/2021,2,Are they making a profit with the tenant?
hm8p8jl,Retrokicker13,11/26/2021,35,And dangerous.  If OP thinks this was just a random one time occurrence for this shithead they’re the god damn fool.
hm8gpyh,PrincessPilar,11/26/2021,1,There are a lot of issues here:  Does Mom live in your house? Is the car still garaged at your house or elsewhere?  Some policies exclude collision coverage if the vehicle is being driven by a resident that is not listed on the policy.  If she were to get in an accident the insurance company has to speak with you as the policyholder and the owner of the car. Given that you are overseas is this easily done?  The best thing to do would be to add her to the policy as a driver until you come back.
hm6sa4i,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,2,Yes you can do your plan.  Some things to be aware of.  * Who is the account owner?  The Family or You?  This person has ultimate control over the 529 and can change the beneficiary at any time. * Each individual part in your plan is legal (You are allowed to gift family money.  Family is allowed to gift money to a 529 with Son as beneficiary).  However a Gift is basically defined by the IRS as something with no strings attached.  If the expectation is to use the family member as a pass through this may no longer be considered a gift.  Additionally the *intent* of the money transfer was to circumvent taxation.  You may be starting to get into an area referred to as tax evasion. * https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/529-plan-gifts-may-be-deductible-from-state-income-tax
hm7niev,Liu1845,11/26/2021,1,ALWAYS take at a minimum what your company match is. If you can budget for it at least 10% is best. Up it 1% every year. Just dont tell your Dad.
hm8bdmy,comp21,11/26/2021,1,Side note: please take this as a lesson in balancing your checkbook every month. Mistakes happen and thats the only way youre going to catch them in a reasonable amount of time.
hm7jnrq,DeaconPat,11/26/2021,1,The key here is it is the renters choice to use autopay. Its not the landlords fault if the check doesnt arrive on time it is the tenants. This is why things like USPS return receipt/ delivery confirmation exist. If the tenant can *PROVE*  the landlord received the check then the tenant wouldnt be responsible for late fees.  In this case there is no proof of delivery so no payment was actually made and the tenant could be liable for late fees and penalties.   IANAL
hm8k8k4,Kingcyprus1,11/26/2021,1,Your moving cross country the last thing you need is a dead battery
hm7rrt7,andy20167,11/26/2021,1,May I ask what you do for work and maybe like a progression pathway through your career? I am a 21 year old recent grad currently working in (kind of) sales operations and trying to figure out next steps. Sometimes we see these big salaries and it is easy to make huge guesses without knowing the actual path someone took to “success”.  Totally understand if you don’t want to just figured I would ask lol
hm74n30,jwc8985,11/26/2021,1,36 months will get you through 4 years of spring/fall semesters. Plus the Post 9/11 GI Bill Living Stipend isn’t accounted for when applying for FAFSA Grants (but reject the FAFSA Loans if offered) I pocketed several thousand dollars per year of FAFSA Grants during college.

hm8glsl,mirinjesse,11/26/2021,1,Looks like you have to pay a monthly fee to join?
hm7u0ew,esdeae,11/26/2021,1,Your first step would be to look for a new employer? Talk about a nuclear option. Expecting employers (and all of the human beings that work for them) to do everything right is a bit... unrealistic dont you think?
hm8qvuy,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,2,You are correct the 1031 does not apply to personal residences.  Only homes that are for investment purposes.  But the 250k/500k capital gains exemption does apply to personal residences.
hm86zc0,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/26/2021,1,Yes we freeze ours.  Temporary unfreeze is easy to do.  Much better to prevent fraud then to be notified of it.
hm8h760,canvassy,11/26/2021,1,You could open an online account at Ally or something pretty quickly.
hm8s9vk,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,2,Yeah and to be pedantic you must have lived in the house for 2 of the last 5 years and owned the house for 2 of the last 5 years but those dont have to be the same 2 years.  You could have lived in the house for 2 years and then bought the house from your landlord and rented it out for 2 years and then qualify.  Gotta love silly over detailed absurd rules.
hm8cfeg,MDfoodie,11/26/2021,1,Entirely in your hands to combat this. Limit debit card / checking account use to recurring charges (rent utilities etc.) and maintain a higher balance so that you are never at risk of overdraft.
hm72ece,OperaticIguana,11/26/2021,2,> has a 0.76% expense ratio (which is the higher than you ever find even with an actively managed fund - seemed pretty ridiculous to me)  Actively managed funds can be 2.5%

hm8gafb,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,So you’re admitting your comment is wrong then.
hm6v85t,Taylor904,11/26/2021,10,If it is an interest earning account getting it out of your account sooner means less interest they would have to pay.
hm8c2b1,PM_ME_YOUR_CALICOS,11/26/2021,1,Yeah Id pass if they make it needlessly difficult to get an inspection. If he wants to repair and sell cars this is something he should know is going to happen.  The car market is pretty trash right now but another car is out there if this one doesnt work out. Dont feel like you need this one because of supply issues or sunk time.
hm6sr96,cajone5,11/26/2021,0,Your employer match is an opportunity for guaranteed 100% return. Where else will you find a better investment than that?
hm7j8un,benj_frito,11/26/2021,1,She was never married. In terms of significant lifestyle changes I tried to explain how important it is to put in a large amount before the year ends since contributions will reset for next year. I tried explaining that getting a return on the money invested is a very big deal but she wasnt convinced. I dont know what to say to convince her that this will help her immensely in the future.
hm6yby9,AcceptableStranger96,11/26/2021,1,Keep it till you graduate you gotta live somewhere.  When you are ready to move sell and rent for a year or two and if you want to put down roots buy in your new city. Invest in low cost index funds in the meantime.
hm8dz5b,asks_mrtgg_questions,11/26/2021,1,Yeah you are right. I think continuously watching the prices skyrocket around me the past 2 years has driven me a little crazy and I needed to be talked off the edge of making an ill-advised purchase. I will plan on saving up for now and hope that prices level out in the meantime otherwise I will just have to look elsewhere for purchasing. Thanks for the advice!
hm7wqqi,737900ER,11/26/2021,1,Does she have any income?
hm8r44d,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,19,Thank you for your concern. I’m well prepared from a personal defense standpoint. I’m not saying that carrying and knowing how to use a firearm is going to save your life but it’s an effective tool to at least mount a defense.   Restraining orders are like laws. Criminals don’t care about laws.
hm8fzre,bruce656,11/26/2021,1,They are perfectly within their rights to drive over and drop the cash payment off if they so choose. So I guess its not easier otherwise they would.
hm6yetw,NeighborhoodNo3050,11/26/2021,1,Did you do it? I’ve been wanting to do the same next year but the interest scare me
hm783wx,Macluawn,11/26/2021,0,It depends. 401k can have high fees.   * 100$ at 8% a year for 40 years is 2172$  * 200$ (100$ with a a 100% match) at 6% a year over 40 years will get you 2057$  If OP is 18 or 19 contributing to low-fee investments can be better. Shouldn’t continue past early 20s though  Make compounding your bitch.
hm7p2q1,The_Jugger,11/26/2021,1,What about withdrawing contributions tax free (if I’m under 59.5 and had it over 5 years)
hm7ch6f,Firm_Bit,11/26/2021,1,> will 1.5 months of 401k make it much more complicated or is it just a couple extra clicks?  No for most folks itll just lower their AGI and lower their tax bill for the year. Try to get as much of this years match as you can.   Also find out if the company does a true up. If not youll need to space your contributions evenly throughout the year in 2022.
hm7mmxu,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,Have lots of kids?  Are you maxing retirement?
hm7q1ca,dequeued,11/26/2021,1,haggiebaby if you read the [Financial Advisors](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/financialadvisors) and [Death of Loved One](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/death_of_loved_one) wiki pages one of the consistent messages is that in complex situations a financial advisor with the appropriate credentials and/or an estate attorney can help you avoid making big mistakes.  ---  To anyone responding [comments are encouraged to](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rules#wiki_comments_are_encouraged_to.3A):  - Be welcoming and friendly. - Include sources. - Have an in-depth answer. - Be inquisitive and avoid guessing.

hm7z2i2,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,It goes without saying that you should absolutely not move forward with this purchase. Youd be paying ~25% for the privilege of buying right now.   Toyota just released a statement a few days ago that they suspect their supply line to be relatively back to normal next year. Probably would be well worth your time to hold IMO.
hm837ze,anythingexceptbertha,11/26/2021,1,Please don’t assume I didn’t read your comment and state it as fact.   OPs bill pay took the funds out right away. The fact that other auto bill providers don’t is irrelevant to this post.
hm8g7kr,dumdum75k,11/26/2021,1,Thanks it should work just the one car my wife is home too so we generally only drive together at this point and yeah my hesitation is if things change getting another car won’t be super easy considering the existing debt…
hm7c7w8,andy20167,11/26/2021,1,I would really love a salary where that is possible haha
hm7zdxe,Sad-Dot9620,11/26/2021,1,It is very difficult to apply for financial aid without your parents’ info before you are 25
hm760l0,cajone5,11/26/2021,3,Missed “half”.  Point still stands. You’ll never find another investment that will produce this guaranteed return.
hm7xxv7,-Alkalore-,11/26/2021,1,Don’t put it in a savings account. Create an investment account and invest it in a mutual fund or your favorite stock if you’re accepting of its potential loss.
hm8huv4,Boobsiclese,11/26/2021,1,They have access. If they are processing transactions they have access.
hm82ocy,takabrash,11/26/2021,1,The ones that annoy me are when they send you an email like eleven days *after* you paid saying your payment is confirmed. I have 17 mini heart attacks each month thinking I forgot to pay something on time or theyre taking an extra payment out.
hm81azc,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,There are no changes to the 2022 taxes for this it reverts to the old setup where the fsa is better. Did I miss something?
hm8jt15,Cstarr91,11/26/2021,1,What happens to your credit score if your debts are just forgiven or written off?
hm81zn0,nancylyn,11/26/2021,1,Just call your insurance agent. I have no idea if they will cover the property but you have to tell them you moved anyway and give them the new info so you can do it all at once. My renters insurance covers my stuff no matter where it is (when my bike was stolen out of my friend’s car they covered it) so if it Is damage or loss of your belongings then it may not matter that your address changed. However if you damaged the property….I don’t know.
hm7ay4w,KiLLiNDaY,11/26/2021,1,Find a roommate first even if you don’t know them through some website (not sure what it is in the UK) - or rent a small room with access to anemities.  Simply put you need to reduce the burden of rent against your total income. Together find a suitable place and talk to your landlord they typically understand
hm6scbs,ladyeclectic79,11/26/2021,1,Well first thing I’d do is take the ASVAB (or whatever the aptitude test is nowadays) and see where you rank then look over what jobs (MOS) are available to you from the different recruiters and decide what sounds like a good fit for you. In the grand scheme of things four years isn’t a lot of time but the training you get could propel your future. Plus most federal jobs (not all tho) give you a step up above the rest of the public by being a veteran.   On the downside since this IS military there’s a chance you could be deployed so you really need to think hard on that aspect. My friend tho has been in the Air Force for two years now and her unit doesn’t look like it’ll deploy for anything other than training anytime soon so it can be a crapshoot. But if you need a swift kick in the rear in SOME direction the military is a great way to go.
hm7kn63,PeeCeeJunior,11/26/2021,1,It’s sad isn’t it? $65k isn’t enough for two kids to go to college.   The oldest daughter has free tuition as part of a lottery funded scholarship in our state. We just pay for housing food books and fees and even then we’ll have to top off another $10k before she graduates.   The youngest doesn’t really want to go to a traditional college so she’ll go to a vocational school. If there’s money left over I guess we’ll pay taxes on it. That or buy her the most awesome computer for ‘school’ money can buy.
hm6y3gl,DekuChan95,11/26/2021,3,I wouldnt include your bonus in your budget since you might not get it or all or it every year. Once you do get it then you can use it for savings etc. Get a reliable car that will last you years..do not get an expensive car just bc its nice and fancy. Theyre higher maintenance and need premium gas. My bf has a 8 year Audi from his mom and he just drops thousands of dollars on maintenance/repairs and a full tank is $55-60.
hm7cj57,OnlyPostSoUsersXray,11/26/2021,1,Thanks! I guess this was my main concern.
hm8nyoc,KingFurykiller,11/26/2021,1,This is not the time to give benefit of the doubt. Even if this was simply a desperate move by a person in a tough spot (which it very well could be scam) this is not the way and a serious violation of your privacy and baking regulations.   Report that stuff right away. You worked hard for your savings you have a right to protect it
hm6txph,continue_improve,11/26/2021,1,At 70/80k you can afford a 250k house. Ideally you’d want to keep mortgage less than 3x your salary.   What’s the loan other than your car loan? I generally think you should be free of those debts before you go and buy a house. I would pay those off using your 56k savings right away and then save up for the downpayment to buy the house.
hm8e8nx,Cejvo7,11/26/2021,1,Like 60% of my total money is in it.
hm8rsw5,Mellytoo,11/26/2021,12,This is horrifying. Listen if this person has contacted you they surely have contacted others. Likely others who wouldnt think to ask whether this is ok on Reddit.  Call your bank now. Like asap. This is a security issue...like call the 24 hour number on your card now. Then follow up in person tomorrow. If you do not feel comfortable going to the branch because you are worried about running into this person go to another branch.  Also screenshot that message now before you make the call and before you are blocked on messenger.  Please consider all of the information this person has on you. Your bank has all of your personal info right down to probably your mothers  maiden name. Make that call immediately.
hm8ryt6,vulcanjedi2814,11/26/2021,6,I’ll counter and ask advice on how you got 80% salary increase immediately followed with another 30% following year
hm8ewtt,chuckfr,11/26/2021,1,The roof and windows are my fist thoughts. How’s the plumbing well/septic or city? How are the pipes in the house?
hm8g8bl,Like300Spartans,11/26/2021,1,Everybody here is spot on! You should also be reporting to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau too!
hm72nc1,Ameteur_Professional,11/26/2021,2,Continuing to live in it is probably your best option.  If you go somewhere else youll have to pay rent mortgage etc.  If you have spare rooms you could look into renting them out.
hm88fc9,93195,11/26/2021,1,It’s your score.  When added as an authorized user it’s as if you were on the card since the account was opened so you have however many years of credit history now.  Thanks sweetie!
hm8i9ws,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,I am curious from others... What order  would you rather these post? You want Netflix to clear and your mortgage to overdraft?    What if the bank doesnt cover the overdraft? Do you want Netflix to bounce or your mortgage to bounce?
hm7heq1,Characterde,11/26/2021,1,Id put the money in their IRA account if they work in some capacity. Id also open up custodial accounts for them. I would use some of the money to educate them on money compound interest so that they dont squander that money. If they need therapy Id use some of the money for that too
hm7wswc,JhihnX,11/26/2021,1,A fair number of landlords still require paper checks mailed. It usually isn’t by choice.
hm8j0uw,brittyn,11/26/2021,1,I basically said the same and got downvoted for it. People are clueless.
hm8octu,YamEducational1515,11/26/2021,1,Not an RN plus I like to make a point to bring a bit of realism to your BS.
hm73skp,PCMR_GHz,11/26/2021,2,I was like you working dead end jobs and not knowing what to do with myself after highschool. I joined the army with the intent on “feeling it out” and if I didn’t like it I would just take my GI Bill and run. Turns out I didn’t care for the military but I learned a lot of skills gained self respect disciplined myself was in great shape as well. I doubt I would have been able to complete my degree if I didn’t go into the military. Best of all I left college with no debt whatsoever and was able to get a VA Home Loan and bought a house shortly after starting a career.

hm74uug,ChrisHisStonks,11/26/2021,8,Id say to spend a few months building out your savings and then upping it to 6% after that. Especially if you dont have the luxury of being able to put aside much money. If you can easily save 1k a month with the matching then I agree with the people below that its free money and you should definitely max out.
hm6vs5i,Klin24,11/26/2021,2,If you can afford to do it max out to the yearly annual limit. Decreases your tax liability and you put away 19.5k. 20.5k in 2022.

hm7v8jx,interstat,11/26/2021,1,I moved from Japan to USA then went to Japanese high school in America for two years and then American high school for junior and senior year.  Met my now wife in high school. We went to seperate colleges and secondary schools I am an optometrist she is an internal medicine/shelter vet.  I went to state school she went to Cornell. Basically we did our 4 years then another 4 years with her + another 4 for specialty.  Essentially for us tho it was keeping costs low. I was making 110k out of optometry school and living with a coworkers family for 150 dollars a month. My job paid for 3 meals a day phone etc and I was on bumblefuck TN. I  had essentially everything to live for free and no family in America so I basically saved everything.(scholarship and job paid for school same with wife).  My wife lived with her sisters family for free making 170k . Against essentially savings everything.  This gave us a war chest of heavy investments that after 6 years we cashed out some of and bought a house with cash  Now we still live in rural area so cost of living is low in general but no debt no mortgage i drive my 2011 Mazda 6 and she drives a 2008ish Honda pilot. Having no need to buy things to live we can spend 70k on luxuries which is insane but still save the rest of our money   Without the war chest while saving super cheap wed never have been in this situation
hm8l4sx,Frosty-Homework,11/26/2021,1,I am an avid skiier and plan to go outdoors most weekends. Car also needs new tires anyways so I’ll probably just throw some snow tires on it if I got that route. Appreciate the advice!
hm8pmm4,snail_juice_plz,11/26/2021,2,One of my children receive survivor benefits. I am **not a lawyer or tax specialist** however I opted to have the funds directly deposited into my checking where my paychecks also go rather than create a new account for child. I then transfer some funds into an investment account intended to gift to my child just as I also transfer money to the bills account my student loans etc.  From a technical standpoint the dollars here and there are fungible when it comes to what went into bills vs this investment account. However SSA does send you a reporting form where you must report what the money was spent on. I believe they have cut the frequency back for survivors benefits but it used to be every year. I report our child’s expenses such as school uniforms extracurriculars etc. My child’s benefit is about half of one of yours so this is easy enough to account for. With a larger amount that may be a bit of a challenge. The form also asks for any leftovers and if they went to *savings* it must be a regular savings account in child’s name. Be prepared in case your wife gets one of these forms which is likely.
hm7ysea,Inb4BanAgain,11/26/2021,1,Weve got a pair of kids and a pair of 529s. No particular reason to back up the concept just seemed right at the time

hm89691,wanttostayhidden,11/26/2021,1,You make too much to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. You can always contribute to a traditional IRA but you make too much to deduct it on your taxes.  You would need to look into doing a backdoor Roth to contribute to a Roth IRA where to contribute to a traditional IRA and then convert that money to a Roth IRA.
hm78s5j,GarfieldDaCat,11/26/2021,1,Yeah I do really enjoy being able to bank the majority of my income just tough living at home as a single guy at 25. I also am relatively frugal (cook most of my own food drive an 8 year old toyota etc.) so I am truly blessed to be able to save as much as I am.   I have considered option B but I am just very hesitant to live with random people again as I had a terrible experience before.
hm8izjq,HighSpeed556,11/26/2021,1,It doesn’t.  They can see all your accounts easily.

As long as you make the minimum payment on time each money your credit score will go up not down.
hm8ixev,awgunner,11/26/2021,1,Contact the bank ASAP check and lock your credit. File police report. In some states that is a type of extortion.
hm6urav,limitless__,11/26/2021,3,Have you gone to multiple mortgqge brokers?  At the the end of the day if you want the house by yourself you need to qualify to get the mortgage by yourself.  If you make enough to qualify you need to find a mortgage company who will play ball.  Them saying they want your wife on the loan is nonsense since you are literally divorcing.
hm8fe1h,Cejvo7,11/26/2021,1,Right on. I appreciate the advice! I’ll keep doing what I’m doing then and eventually look at real estate when the market slows

hm7glpq,LilacStreetCapital,11/26/2021,1,That’s a good reason. However why do you feel compelled to buy your mother a house? Renting her a small apartment or renting a larger apartment with her are both valid options.
hm8njio,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,>But there are several rules specific to houses that let you reduce or eliminate that capital gain.  The most common two are that if you buy another house with the gains you dont have to pay taxes and if you lived there for 2 out of the last 5 years you can reduce the capital gain buy 250k per person or 500k per married couple.  But those exceptions to capital gains are specific to house and do not apply to other forms of capital gains.  that if you buy another house with the gains you dont have to pay taxes -- this doesnt apply to the sale of personal residences only to investment property and then only if the 1031 exchange is executed correctly.
hm76syy,erotictravel,11/26/2021,4,You have not expressed any willingness or attempt to cut any expenses. You have a budget so start cutting to the bone and yes  that includes the gym membership.   My guess is your car payment is very high relative to your income and entertainment expenses are out of control.
hm815ai,nattyay,11/26/2021,1,Yes I do have full coverage insurance. So sueing would be my best chance?
hm8eova,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,The quotes for these repairs are most likely by the book.  Dropping the oil pan and tranny pan and replacing the links and seals have large overlaps in labor.  Parts would be about 1k from rock auto all of that can be done in less than 8 hours and none of it is very technical so anyone mechanically inclined should be able to do the work.  If you find a mechanic moonlighting that wants some extra weekend cash you can probably get this all fixed for $1500 if you wanted to keep it.

hm775xu,bingqiling,11/26/2021,2,$1500k is not enough for an emergency fund you really want closer to 6 months saved up.   So I would 1) save pretty aggressively for a couple months to get my emergency fund up once that is set then 2) I would increase my retirement to 6%.
hm7pidf,SouthsideVike,11/26/2021,1,Look into getting your CDL and driving for FedEx. You’re already in the door. I have a few friends that drive around the Chicago area all making 100k+. Start your 401k ASAP and before you know it you’ll be way ahead of everyone else your age. Good luck!
hm7fpm4,DBCOOPER888,11/26/2021,1,>Me? Id get my emergency fund in order with a quickness before maxing out retirement matching.  But if you truly needed the money you could go for an early withdrawal of the matching portion pay the fee and taxes and still come out ahead than if you didnt invest to the match in the first place. Thats a guaranteed 100% return off the bat.
hm85gph,Efficient-Hunter4867,11/26/2021,1,My career is actually enjoyable most of the time and the pay and fun improves over the years. I wouldn’t quit unless for some reason I took a 50% pay cut (would just hurt my feelings working for half pay) or if I already had over $10M net worth. It makes my investment goals differ from most who want to retire early.
hm8fqt2,LEGO_Jotaro_Kujo,11/26/2021,1,Dont keep your eyes dead set on just the Army. Check out all the other branches get information from them. Personally I recommend the Air Force but I have no say in what to do with your life so use this information however you want.
hm7khdb,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,Your doing fine. If you go with your gut and contribute more when your young you can coast in your later years.
hm8a7bn,littlebuffkin,11/26/2021,1,I wouldn’t recommend it. When we bought our house our mortgage was $2300 and our take home was about $5-6K and it was miserably tight. You don’t realize all of the other expenses that go up when you get more space maybe it would be lest bad on a condo. But we literally had no wiggle room and one thing went wrong (more like 5 because it always happens that way) and I had to pick up a second job to help us get stable. Eventually we refinanced our mortgage down to $1800 and our take home pay went up to about $7-8000 and we are more comfortable. If you are willing to be house poor you can do it that’s what we did for much the same reason you have. Our area has exploded our home was $350K in 2019 and now appraised at $475K so I have no regrets but it was really uncomfortable
hm8rmfh,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,4,You can contribute if you are not a tax dependent.
hm86kg2,sfennix,11/26/2021,1,130 per month extra contribution between 3% and 6%. Essentially If you contribute the extra 3% to get the matching you are gaining $1560 free money per year plus any gains in the retirement account.    That extra savings of $1560 per year of reduced retirement contribution isnt going to suddenly increase your savings/emergency fund. It is not going to pay off your loans but it will make a difference in that retirement account. Dont turn down the matching. Money into your retirement early is far better that money in your retirement account later.
hm7grky,BurnAccount1974,11/26/2021,1,Yeah that’s my struggle basically. I’m in an AMAZING new job but I have to pay down some credit and give my new income time to get established to boost my score before I try to get into a different car loan.  Ideally while prices are still high I’ll get word that my return-to-office date has been extended allowing us to use one car temporarily. Then I’ll be able to sell my car to get out from under my post-bankruptcy loan and bank the difference (I was only upside down by 1-2k before prices went up). Hopefully by the time I get recalled prices will have stabilized AND my credit score would be WAY up allowing me to use the original overpayment as a down payment for a new loan with a different lender at a lower interest rate.

hm8a2sp,kenjiman1986,11/26/2021,1,Don’t want to dig into specifics. But are you able to work? Are you mobile? If not I know a lot of companies are hiring for at home work. I had a lot of friends recently switch over from shitty jobs to work at home opportunity’s. I don’t know what kind of skills you have or how much time you have after class.

As Spain is a member of EU Spanish citizenship would allow to reside anywhere in EU afaik.
hm70si6,BurnAccount1974,11/26/2021,2,I’ve been wondering about this… do they care about fairly minor cosmetic damage right now as long as everything else on the car is well-maintained and completely functional?   I had another driver scrape my rear driver side quarter panel in a parking lot and bail without leaving any info in the spring so now the scrape/dent is rusted where the paint was missing. I didn’t want to generate a comp claim for such a small repair against my insurance since I’d had two not-at-faults that year already (because men don’t know how to drive the giant trucks they ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE IN A SMALL CITY) so I’ve been waiting until I have enough saved to pay out of pocket.
hm709dy,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for the suggestion. Ireland sorta has student loans but it requires a guarantor which I didnt have (super low-income family). The country mostly has a really generous grant scheme but its designed to get you up through levels of education i.e. undergrad --> masters. I looked into getting a grant again but I have a masters already and I couldnt get it for a second masters even if itll be more career relevant
hm708yt,Gavilan_y_Paloma,11/26/2021,3,I am also soooo grateful that we are okay. It was a scary moment that I wish I could rewind. Thank you for your guiding questions.    From the looks of it Im thinking it would be more beneficial to simply sell my car to my insurance to pay off my current loan then pocket the small extra to go towards a different vehicle... super excited about that. :(
hm7g3c8,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,I have never paid a loan fee to take out an auto loan.  0% deals are almost always subsidized by the manufacturer to there are definitely not loan fees on them.  Sometimes you have a choice of a cash rebate or promo financing but other times there is no choice just promo financing or find your own financing.

hm82tcw,gregallen1989,11/26/2021,1,You should still be able to grow your savings while matching the 6%. If not make sure your budget is tight. If you still cant then sure you might want to bump up your savings a little but at 24 that extra 2 percent in your 401k is HUGE and you want to do it if at all possible

But after that a match is probably\* free money.  \* if your company has a vesting schedule you should find out what it is. You may have to stay at the company for a certain number of years before they actually let you keep some or all of that match money.
hm6wwqu,Mishapchap,11/26/2021,1,Never let more than 2 months of social security income sit in the account. That’s when they can garnish it. Based on what you are saying that wouldn’t happen but just make sure that the account the SS flows into has an outflow of the SS payment every month.   An old person I mines was in the same situation and this is what a nonprofit elder law firm advised me. So If they get  $1000 in SS income make sure to withdraw $1000 from the account that month.   The person I know stopped making minimum payments on the card (they had gotten very high) and other than phone calls and letters from collectors nothing happened. It’s been 3 years now. Edited to add— these people had no assets.

Barely sustainable. You need to set off the fire in front of you first. You are not ready to look for long term yet.    Yes you are losing free money from matching but its your retirement fund and you seem to be still youmg age.    Also this sub loves to say delay your student loan because inflation is higher than interest rate but start paying little by little even <100 a month.  If you dont make any dent after certain period of time your credit score **tanks** by saying something along *proportion of loan balance to loan amount is too high*

He got more money than he invested. That is capital gains.

hm7onyr,ilikebigcats2020,11/26/2021,1,Everything everyone else said and also- 1. So fucking annoying that if you make little mistakes you’re fined and penalized but I’m sure you won’t be receiving any bonus after all this crap you’re doing. 2. Still not ok but just a reminder that the world is still burning and there are a lot of staffing issues so the hr department maybe just lost someone who is usually in charge of this someone has been quarantined or home taking care of kids who have been put on virtual school they are short staffed etc etc.  But you should get a special hassle pay bonus for sure
hm6tzmt,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,The capital gains stacks on top of your regular income  $50k - $10k 401k - $12k deduction = $28k  40k - 28k = you have $12k @ 0% capital gains  If you want the money to be invested in index funds why not push anything over the $40k into your 401k? Youre paying 15% cap gains but getting 22% deduction meaning that IRS is actually paying you 7% to re-balance from taxable brokerage to 401k.  > Roth IRA. 6000 Limit per year. Can take contributions out penalty free and earnings penalty free for special instances. E.G purchase of first home.  Contributions can be taken out tax AND penalty free. Anything above that like the $10k home purchase is only penalty free  > Another potential advantage of opening a Roth instead of upping 401k would be the tax implications right? Since it is after tax money and grows tax free I do not pay capital gains tax on the sales   You never pay taxes on sales within an IRA or 401k. The only tax implications are when you take out money.
hm82v07,dmccrostie,11/26/2021,1,Think of insurance as three coverages: Liability - pays the other guy  Comprehensive - pays you when the vehicle isn’t moving  Collision - pays when the vehicle is moving  If you only had liability which most states require as minimum you’re kinda screwed. If you have collisions YOUR Company will fix your car up to the maximum coverage you have. Once they find the other guy your company will go after his company through a process called “subrogation”. If they don’t find the other guy typically they will still fix your car but your rates will most likely go up.   If you do have Collision along with Liability defiantly contact your agent to file a claim. Good luck.

I wouldnt be comfortable banking with them after this though even if they do straight  away fire that employee he could have friends at that branch he could blame you etc. Id move my money asap to avoid potential bigger headaches and some peice of mind. Sorry this happened to you what a bizarre story!
hm6wsar,Auvilla,11/26/2021,1,I just got an extra 2k that I dont need. Im stable on my job full time freelance maxed out roth IRA already have money in trading accounts and some crypto. I have money saved and tucked away to buy a house with when I find a good deal (I have 45% more saved than I need for my down payment). So what to do with random 2k?
hm799nt,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,1,You really need to compare youre expenditures with the rewards. Points vs cash back doesnt really matter because you can convert (usually) the points to cash so as long as youre not limited to using the points on something specific then it doesnt matter.  I combine a card with high percentage category card with a no category card.
hm8hva0,optimaloptimist101,11/26/2021,1,How much do you have in deposits with them? Do you have a Chase branch near you?
hm8r0ll,HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,11/26/2021,1,Look into VTSAX after you max out your IRA.
hm79n5h,jPharm247,11/26/2021,2,just commenting bc Im in Illinois too had to use an estate lawyer for my moms estate and honestly loved and would recommend the guy. he directed us to a fa that I interviewed but didnt use and a tax guy/accountant that I dont love but still use 4 years later.   essentially what Im saying is it may be a good jumping off point for you to figure this all out via a professional. would be happy to give contact info for lawyer if needed (hes based in cook County Im in lake)

hm6tasn,phryan,11/26/2021,1,It doesnt take much to fake an order number most places its sequential or otherwise easy to guess a valid order number. Its likely random phishing trying to get people to call and volunteer key information under the guise of verifying the account.  Like the email I got this morning from Citibank about a charge to my card I dont have a Citibank card. However I bet the guy on the other end of the phone will ask for my name phone number and ssn.

hm8e9it,questionmark693,11/26/2021,1,I work for Verizon and we get fired for contacting customers using that personal info. That seems orders of magnitude more inappropriate - and the manager needs to know about that ASAP
hm6xkra,drepidural,11/26/2021,1,Agreed. I switched from chase to TD and they don’t withdraw the $ until the check is cashed.   Don’t miss Chase for checking or savings.
hm87egk,Fishtale1,11/26/2021,1,I wouldnt say hes hiding the previous damage! He was told by the insurance company he purchased it from that it got hit by a deer and told me the things he replaced on it. Youre correct that the resale value is destroyed which is why I plan to drive it til it needs to be scrapped.   Thank you for your input!
hm7ukto,redapoluza,11/26/2021,1,I still owe 14k on the ram as stated in my post. There is absolutely no chance of me getting a trade in value of 22k to cover a new 8k vehicle

hm800h7,iced_out_pickle,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for the reply! Both of our cars are paid for (mine is a $3k beater hers is a $20k Jeep). I WFH so most of this expense is hers as Jeeps are terrible on gas plus she has collision insurance.   $90 sinking fund for maintenance   $230 for insurance   $190 for car replacement fund   $319 for fuel (average over last 12mo)   $20 for annual registration
hm80w1v,RetireBeforeDeath,11/26/2021,1,You pay income tax (which you pay anyway if you dont put the money into the 401k) and a 10% penalty. But two things.  1. The match return is greater than 10% (the calculus here changes if theres a vesting period on the match). 2. Youre still measuring the expectation value of not needing the withdrawal vs needing the withdrawal. Theres asymmetry here because you cant put money into the 401k next year and expect the same return.  Theres certainly something to be said about the peace of mind of a cash emergency fund. But the match is free money. Theres also questioning what kind of emergency fund it is. The OP has no savings so is it risk of lost job emergency or risk of running out of gas emergency (ok $1500 isnt quite 0 but what kind of buffer does someone need for the less-catastrophic emergencies)?
hm82b5m,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,Well I don’t have $1800. That’s why I offered to settle it for a lower amount. I assumed they’d at least respond with something but frankly - I don’t even know for sure I’m contacting the correct creditor since I can’t find the debt on any credit reports (did the free annual credit report website) and I’m basing this off of the mortgage guy telling me the amount and that it was with Target.   I’m not in a rush to buy a house. I only applied because there was a specific house that made sense and rent is so crazy it was a decent idea if that panned out. It didn’t and that’s fine but I hadn’t even remembered this target debt until it was brought up.
hm6w5p3,Kortze26,11/26/2021,1,I think the type of people that down voted are Starbucks employees with $140k+ student loan debt with annual income around $25k/year.

hm8irkm,myze551ml,11/26/2021,1,> Both properties are in decent shape but could use some renovation in my opinion..... I am looking to make the best of this situation because both of my parents are in their late 50s working full time. I would say we are lower middle class  Not all renovation adds value and many of them cost more than the value they add.  The most important things when it comes to property are location location location from the few details you gave sounds like these are in good locations.  If your parents are lower middle class but have managed to own 2 properties - sounds like they are quite good at managing their money and investment to build it up.   Rather than asking random internet strangers for suggestions you may want to talk to them (along the lines of wanting to learn from them how you can build up your own real estate portfolio in future).
hm86n21,brawlrats,11/26/2021,1,Yes you must have earned income to fund an IRA.
hm7cnm5,rallyally,11/26/2021,1,I’m sure that’s similar to how this problem has snowballed. All I can see on our employee resource portal is to call one HR number and they obviously can’t be the one to directly solve this. Sigh
hm6v68t,lovelyhappyface,11/26/2021,1,Plus if he just stops looking for a job and moves in with family unless he’s in the right headspace he could become dependent on them .   I also feel that maybe OP doesn’t want to be in a relationship he’s saying he wants to sell the home and his gf and him live with their respective families if so this is an indirect way out
hm8dll1,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,1,I’ve transferred everything from that account to another account that’s internal to that bank. Not sure if that helps or not but it makes me feel slightly better until I can get in contact with a branch manager regarding the situation.
hm8bu0y,Kiyae1,11/26/2021,1,Typically you should always contribute up to your employer’s match otherwise you aren’t collecting your complete and total compensation package.   It’s also usually a foundational piece of financial advice to contribute as much as possible as young as possible since time-in-market is usually the biggest determining factor in the amount of growth your investment will experience.   Everyone’s financial priorities will be different. To put this in context 2% of $52000 annually is about an extra $1040 every year for you to put towards student loans and savings (it’s actually less than $1040 because of taxes). But increasing your 401k contribute 2% will add $2080 to your investments/retirement savings which will have about an extra 5-10 years to grow in value compared to many of your peers who won’t start contributing until their thirties.
hm6vwge,Fubbalicious,11/26/2021,1,Youll have to talk to the bank and see if there is a way to unblock your account.  However as a cautionary tale this is exactly why I advocate to people to have accounts with at least two different banks--ideally with checking savings debit card and blank checks already setup.  And to have at least one month of expenses saved up at the backup bank.  This way if youre ever locked out or have your account hacked/bank account drained you still have money elsewhere to pay your bills in the meantime while you sort out the mess.  As for what to do do you have credit cards you can use to pay your bills in the meantime?  Otherwise you might need to ask friends/family for a loan to get you by.
hm8tvue,JDizzleNunyaBizzle,11/26/2021,11,I work in retail banking and this is not somebody you want working in retail banking. In fact we have mandatory training yearly that talks about never ever doing anything even remotely like this. You should talk to the branch manager.

hm8plpg,volsrun18,11/26/2021,19,This is illegal unethical and unprofessional. This person has access to all of your account and bank information all of your demographic and personal information and most importantly your social security number. Contact your institution’s 24/7 hotline escalate as high as you possibly can and contact your branch manager or even their superior immediately Monday morning. Do not speak with anyone lateral with that banker. Save and document everything as evidence. Do not contact the banker. If the bank doesn’t offer a significant response involve the police. Lastly move banks.  We are restricted from even acknowledging customers in public much less interacting with them.

hm7e2e9,arrown8606t,11/26/2021,1,You have paid 49% of the principal amount of your loan. At the beginning you pay more interest and less principal. This slowly reverses as the principal amount is reduced when you get furher into your loan. You now have 2 years left but during those 2 years your payments are lower interest and more actually going to the amount owed.

hm77yk4,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,I appreciate the detailed response.   If my earnings are better and Im not being hounded by a debt collector I think I can live with not being eligible for an auto loan or a mortgage and I can survive with just a debit card.  I guess what concerns me most is being able to rent an apartment with poor credit.   Do you happen to know what issues I might come up against in this regard and how they may be overcome?
hm8e2sm,rawbumhole,11/26/2021,1,I’d be waiting outside the bank first thing in the morning for them to open. You need to take this very seriously and report as soon as possible.

hm8s2t5,ShadowWebDeveloper,11/26/2021,1,Bank pays this typically. Bill pay is free for me to use at least.  Bigger companies will use ACH instead and when you add the payee the bank will know which ones can take ACH. This is more like a wire payment scenario (though still settles overnight).
hm78o9z,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,You are comparing 7% to 50% and deciding that 7% is more?  I really dont understand the math here.

hm6wtlj,93195,11/26/2021,2,Really depends on the rental market. For a house in that price range it probably takes something around $2500 to $3000 a month to make renting worthwhile.  So can you reliably get that?    The other issues are that your new mortgage payment and cash out re-fi payments are “for sure” and rental income is dependent on both having a tenant at all and then that tenant actually paying.  Lots of landlord horror stories out there right now with non paying tenants they can’t evict.  Being a landlord is also work - when something breaks that’s on you to figure out and fix and do it right away.  Keeping and renting can be a solid idea depending on the market financials and your willingness to deal with the hassles of being a landlord.  It’s far from a slam dunk though.
hm7nnad,FrostyMittenJob,11/26/2021,1,Thats not how Chase bill pay works. The moment you submit the payment they debit your account. The payment that is sent is made out of a completely different account
hm8pfqa,chimneytossaway,11/26/2021,1,USAF also has a shorter basic training. Better tech schools and they send the officers out to get shot at.
hm8rb8a,davidm2232,11/26/2021,1,I wish bank apps/sites had the option to put a virtual hold on when you write a physical check. Its impractical to keep a paper balanced checkbook with all the autopay and debit card transaction going in and out of your account. Be nice if when the check was written my bank account could instantly reflect that I had already spent that money

hm85p92,Piriper0,11/26/2021,1,Joining the military *solely* for financial reasons is a bad call.  Yes there definitely are solid financial benefits and yes youll have some control over what job you do and how that impacts your future trajectory - both are solid points that others have made.  But there are big costs involved too. Theres a good chance youll do permanent long-term damage to your body. You may be called upon to go to war - both China and Russia are making some worrying moves right now. You will give up any autonomy over your time for the duration of your contract - you dont really have time off in the military as the folks you report to can have you perform any kinds of duties on evenings or weekends. And once youre in its very tough to get out - you cant just quit like you would for any normal job. The pay is also quite low for enlisted folks though the benefits (housing medical etc.) somewhat balance that out.   If you think the military would be a good cultural fit for you and the negatives dont bother you too much then it may be a good fit for you. If so absolutely do your research ahead of time about what branch you want and what job you want. Tell the recruiter what you want dont let them tell you what you want.
hm7dqxi,lstac936,11/26/2021,1,It was 13 percent. However I joined the military a year ago so they had to drop the rate to 6 percent

hm7n4hz,SheeshSheeshSHEESHs,11/26/2021,1,Not being untruthful? cars depreciate unless you got the bat mobile they used in a movie there isn’t a demand for any given car unless your purchasing Classic cars but even then they still depreciate if you drive them instead of somebody trying to assume your “out of the box” thinking explain it. It doesn’t really make sense. Take care.
hm6wfol,rowrowrowurbutt,11/26/2021,1,Thank you thats a good idea to check out!  Mom had no will no probate. She gave me some verbal instructions before she passed but it was more about her funeral than anything financial. Ive never dealt with a death in the family before so...honestly Im not really sure what Im doing but Im too afraid of a big attorney fee to try and hire one.  Her car was paid off. I closed all of her credit accounts and stopped any recurring donations. She had a mortgage but Ive just continued paying it since Ive been living abroad and didnt want to stir any difficult situations up when I wouldnt be stateside to handle them. Now that Im back in the US my next step will be contacting the mortgage company. I also recently learned I need to send her death certificate to Social Security Id thought the cremation service did so already. Its been quite a learning curve!
hm7vqni,RealMccoy13x,11/26/2021,1,Liable was the wrong word. I apologize I answer so CFPB related questions and most relate to loss. In this case it would be just not in your favor instead of liable. You are afforded certain consumer protections under law. I would just ensure you are focused in on the violations or where you believe there was a deviation/misleading by the entity.
hm7itlk,mmsj10,11/26/2021,1,Yes it is be go into the navy or if you are unsure join the reserves.  Once you get to boot camp you will see if it is a good fit for joining full time.  Also within the next four years you will most likely have a bunch of dead end jobs with joining the military full time you will get your housing paid for plus on the job trading with college $$ at the end.  You will also learn a great deal of personal discipline which will serve you well your entire life
hm746ep,missha515,11/26/2021,4,Can you get roommates to lower rental costs and still be close to your job and gym?
hm8kioj,iced_out_pickle,11/26/2021,1,We do use our date fund for general entertainment eating out shows etc. We pay our membership fee to a local rock climbing gym that we both go to out of that as well. I think were both really satisfied with our level of fun and entertainment right now haha.  I took our current utility costs vs. our apartment sqft and multiplied them out based on what I think our house sqft will likely be which isnt the best estimate but is decent enough I suppose.   Note: we have the $55k saved now so unless we wanted to buy bigger wed be good to go for this amount. The $20k emergency fund is separate and something were not going to touch in order to buy the house.
hm7bldj,Penguinis,11/26/2021,1,>Yeah... you ARE guaranteed that pay  No no you are not. I know many people with **4 year** degrees in IT that dont/did not make that starting out. Its fantastic that you did it and the market in which you are situated seems to support that (based on your claims) but it is certainly not the absolute rule everywhere. If the market gets saturated they pay less. Just how the world works.  Your advice has some merit in it but Id caution making claims like you are  guaranteed some pay rate. Its in the same vein as take a coding boot camp youll land a job no issues which is far from the reality.
hm8pasm,SeattleSushiGirl,11/26/2021,11,With every bank Ive ever worked with a customers SSN/Birthday/Full name/Address is available within a couple clicks.

If not for yourself but for the rest of us.
hm7ruoo,93195,11/26/2021,1,Is it worth it to get a full inspection and repair quote?  Sure.  That’s the right answer financially.  That said if it’s a 20 year old car worth a few thousand or less it still drives fine I’d personally probably just let it go.  But that’s just me being nice.
hm75622,CorrectPeanut5,11/26/2021,3,Banks and credit card companies get deceased notices from a variety of sources. Theyll know soon enough and close the account.    Not really fraud per se as its a card in your name and youd be on the hook for the charges in the event the estate doesnt pay. They will expect everyone to square up on whats owed when the account closes.
hm8cqqy,FlutieFlakes22,11/26/2021,1,But doesnt contributing to vtsax keep you from maxing out your savings for a house? I wanted a house pretty badly straight out of high-school and couldnt stand paying rent knowing it wasnt going towards anything. Ended up saving aggressively buying a house at 23. I could have put more towards retirement but I would have had to rent longer. And my homes value has doubled since I bought it in 2015. Obviously cant predict how real estate vs stock market will perform over the next several years but owning your own house is a great feeling.
hm870ag,Cruian,11/26/2021,1,>Can you tell me why? Would you do 300 VTSAX and 100 VTIAX?  Diversification. The US isnt always and wont always be the best performing market. If you want I can post 10+ links that should show the benefits of investing internationally.  * https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vtwax  - Global market cap weights. Id argue this should be the default position.  * https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/investment/international-investing  - Vanguard 40% of stock is recommended to be international  >I think I can only do VTI unless I buy a whole share of VTSAX now that I think about it.  VTSAX and VTIAX have initial minimums of $3000. After you buy that initial amount you can invest as little as $1 for future purchases.  VTI and VXUS (the ETF forms) must be traded as whole shares (if Vanguard is your brokerage).  You could simply combine VTI/VTSAX and VXUS/VTIAX into VT or VTWAX which should act very similar to both combined into one at global market cap weights.

hm7s3n9,Werewolfdad,11/26/2021,1,I’d say the odds of someone remaining in a single 401k plan for 40 years are low.
hm7f8wa,tastygluecakes,11/26/2021,1,Mortgage is “good” debt.  Three reasons: tax advantages for interest deductions leverage on asset than generally appreciates at least with inflation (but 5x levered) and right now it’s incredibly cheap debt.  If I had another dollar right now paying down my mortgage early is about the last thing I’d do with it.  Retirement savings or other investing is much better in the long run IMO.  And frankly I’d rather “invest” in my own happiness today with buying something or taking a trip.    For some there is a sense of security/comfort in paying off mortgage.  Which is fine if that’s you.  You are buying peace of mind.  But from a strictly financial POV it’s a low yield return.  Edit: this thinking applies to people who are generally in good shape and responsible with their finances.  It sounds like you are.  For people with poor credit and money management paying down your mortgage early is forced savings on money you might otherwise blow on consuming.  But again doesn’t seem like that your situation OP.

hm79k0p,Birdy_Cephon_Altera,11/26/2021,2,> Chase said the funds would have been returned if it wasnt cashed within 90 days.  This is the part that I doubt - I suspect OP is getting bad info from an ill-informed Chase rep on this.  Fairly sure funds do NOT return back to the account if it is not cashed.  OP is going to have to request a stop payment on the cashiers check (which can only be done after 90 days have passed since the cashiers check was issued and that amount of time has passed.)
hm8s294,kindrudekid,11/26/2021,-9,Honestly write a nice letter and to the point and fax it to the branch manager and corporate.  Sometimes when you call they just wanna be over with and move on. And with todays labor market they might just reprimand him.  And do mention how you can be made whole if you have a mortgage maybe ask for a no cost lower rate loan in exchange for not making a big deal out of it.

Ive seen it happen.  I had a guy fuck up his payroll and direct deposit forms six ways from Sunday and the hammer came down on us when he complained his DD didnt show up on pay day.    We had to stop everything write a check and drive it to his house.  It was totally his fault but the point of telling you the story is the DoL will have your back 100%
hm78v64,ilulsion,11/26/2021,5,I think he *also* wants you to take advantage of the 0% interest. If you have a smaller balance once interest kicks in the monthly payments shouldnt be as high. I thought about this too when I first graduated. It ended up not mattering though because I went to grad school.
hm8fauq,jellicle,11/26/2021,1,It was a common bank tactic to run debits in order from largest to smallest followed by credits. If the largest debit overdrafts the account then each small debit incurs an extra overdraft fee. There has been some pushback against this but I think most banks still do this. It absolutely is by design.  Banks make most of their money from fees such as these not interest on loans they make.
hm85we4,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,Lol I just looked it up. You only owe capital gains taxes when you sell it for more than it’s worth. And literally nobody buys cars for more then they are worth.

I worked my butt off to earn the salary I do but now I’m back to being poor because I can barely comfortably afford a home for $260k which most are $300k. If I were to sell my home I would be biased and help out single parents and people especially for just a $5k difference. Couples buying a home have more options and less financial responsibility for each person. Couples will be fine even in this market. Cheers x

Depending on condition any of the above are likely to offer you more than you owe maybe even close to what you paid for it.

hm7cf98,rdobah,11/26/2021,1,What happens if the landlord tries to redeposit the check you just printed out?  If it was cashed then no funds would be available.  Isnt there a return fee for failed checks?  If it deposits then it was his/her fault they didnt cash the check.
hm6x48i,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,4,That is the way many(if not all) banks process bill pay payments.  They take the money out immediately and then either process an electronic payment or mail a check.

hm7b1eq,Birdy_Cephon_Altera,11/26/2021,4,> Most banks dont even collect the SSN and addresses for AUs.  I would be curious about this because our bank is now under a regulatory Consent Order to do just that - gather rigorous KYC documentation on all of the authorized signers on our various credit card products (which apparently wasnt happening before).  Just went through a presentation with upper management in the past week where we analyzed the expected contact rates and required additional staffing that will be needed in 2022 as we field questions and concerns from our credit card clients as we roll this out across the different brands of cards we manage.
hm721qp,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,3,To clarify the outstanding debt to the original 401k loan technically can still be treated as early withdrawal when he quits. This is up to the 401k plan and former employer. The technical term is called a **loan offset**. Normally someone has 60 days to rollover an early distribution before it becomes permanent.  But for this one particular type of loan offset when someone leaves the employment with the 401k loan in good standing called **qualified plan loan offset (QPLO) Code M on Form 1099-R** he can delay including the offset balance in gross income and early withdrawal penalty *and* be able to send the repayments into his new 401k or his traditional IRA and treat these repayments as rollovers until the new Oct 2022 deadline (tax return due date plus extension). As you know rollovers are not subject to tax or penalty or contribution limits.  Make sure to file tax returns on time.
hm8rt2v,diatho,11/26/2021,2,Traditional homes generate their value from two items the physical house and the land.   A mobile home placed on rented land only gains value from the home.  The mobile part of these homes is largely overstated. Once put in place they are difficult and expensive to move so youre trapped. You need to keep paying rent on land which will go up.    A mobile home on land you own will gain value from both. If you go to sell the home may not have much value but the land will.   Additionally you cannot get a traditional mortgage for these homes and have to get specialized loans.   https://youtu.be/jCC8fPQOaxU thats another good video to watch.   As an investment its not great. If you own the land and the home then its an ok option for a place to live. And if it keeps your costs low you have an asset you can sell (the land) and free cash for investing.
hm7yozx,_Toomuchawesome,11/26/2021,1,okay makes sense. in the 3 million investment example even with him pulling out ~115k each year thats like ~20 year runway...  pretty fucking insane. i gotta start strategizing

hm88i1v,rkaniminew,11/26/2021,1,Understand his view and position completely however in this economy with an outlook of high inflation.    Savings / Debt is worth less than investing.    He probably wants you to have a good emergency fund before saving for retirement.    However alot of people from his era listen to Dave Ramsey types.    I would say always max out your 401k match- its literally free money that compounds overtime.    The debt will be worth less in 5 years. Carrying it wont hurt you much and you can usually *outpace* the debt interest (under 5%) if youre not being frivolous and investing in some long term funds (especially if they average out 6%+ year after year.) Then take in account inflation over 3% makes those numbers gap even wider.    Exp Student Loan - (Base Payment + Additional Principle Payment) vs (Base Payment + Ad. Principle Payment 1/2) And 1/2 of that payment instead going to individual general market fund will out pace the loan interests cost.   As for a static savings account. Its important to have liquid emergency funds but every year its worth 3% less than it was the year before unless you have a decent savings account APR.
hm8h3hr,sf_torquatus,11/26/2021,1,It would be nice if the police figure out the drivers identity but thats not usually the case. What most people in this situation experience is having to go through their own insurance...and lose some faith in humanity.  If I were in your shoes I would use your uninsured motorist coverage. If the car is totaled then the adjuster will cut you a check. If its virtual then you may get the money within a business day otherwise youll have to wait for the in-person appointment. If your car isnt totaled then add a few more weeks for the body shop to fix it.  Either way if (big if) they find the driver then the insurance company will go after them.  Also if the car is totaled then the check should be the fair market value not the cost of a replacement. Youll still have to get another car and then pay the sticker price along with the tax title licensing dealership fees (if applicable) and the potential increase in insurance rates. All this is to say that you will end up in less car than you were previously driving unless you put in money of your own (note that this is a perfectly acceptable use of some emergency money).  I hope the cops find them. And though it sucks all around we can all be thankful that youre not seriously injured.

hm7u5xb,hopingtothrive,11/26/2021,1,I see where your father is coming from. Free money from company match is great but his thinking is get your emergency fund up first. I can see leaving the student debt alone and pay that off over time or with a bonus you might get. $1500 is not enough in savings to carry you through a rough time (lay off medical expense emergency travel etc).  Your dad isnt wrong. You are only 24. You will have many years to add to your 401k.
hm713ka,GuiltyAmoeba,11/26/2021,4,Can’t speak for others but a friend I know retired after he turned a 20K investment into about 3.5 million In 6 years. He put 3 million into S&P 500 etf (not sure what he did with the rest of the money) and withdraws 6% annually giving him about 115K after taxes to live each year which is more than enough at his age. He also has a part time job he loves that makes around 30k a year.

hm7cg0l,DonaldKey,11/26/2021,1,Credit unions usually have the best rates. Be careful though. Car dealerships sell loans not cars anymore so you won’t get a deal with your own loan.

hm796h4,Dannick2,11/26/2021,1,You pay interest on student loans. You earn interest on 401(k)  You could theoretically put $500 extra towards your student loans and you will pay interest on balance -500 going forward.  Or you can put $500 in your 401(k) company match of $250 and begin earning interest on $750.   Your student loan interest rates would need to be 1.5x the 401(k) returns in order for it to make sense to put money toward student loans. And guess what this is nearly impossible. Not sure what your loan rates are mine are in the 3-6% range. Over the past century stock returns are about 10%.   Its a bit of delayed gratification and you will pay additional interest on your student loans. The money you invest will be worth several times as much as that additional interest in the long run though allowing you to have a much more comfortable retirement.
hm8l4sv,Rubily00,11/26/2021,1,You know them better than we do but its very possible youll be seen as meddling or stirring the pot if theyre happy with the way things are.  If they *arent* happy with the way things are then their specific unhappiness is going to decide your path forward. Do they not like having to manage another property? Offer to sell the property to the tenant or put it up on the market. Do they want MORE properties? Sit down with their finances and decide if they can afford a down payment on another one. Do they want to downsize? Move? Start looking for new places to live that fill their wishes. Etc etc.
hm8gz3k,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,I’m using VR&E and might keep doing school after my bachelors. The field I’m going to college for isn’t that lucrative at all but with BAH  I’m comfortable for now. My wife is going to school as well for something much more lucrative so we are both unemployed right now so the loan won’t be enough for where I currently live and I don’t intend to move until I’m done with school.  What kind of work do you hire for?
hm82kpd,ForeverALone_Ranger,11/26/2021,1,Appreciate the response.
hm7zwv1,Volthian,11/26/2021,1,I recently found and fell in love with a program called Tiller. It’s google-sheets based and I believe open source. Has a great community and lots of customizable and creatable graphs/charts/functions. It does cost $80/year but they do give you a 30 day free stint to try it out. For me it gives me much better control over how I want to look at the data than any other program I’ve used before. Really enjoy it.
hm6wabn,joey_subie,11/26/2021,1,Not opposed to selling the only thing is we are currently living in the house (my bad for not making it more clear). So I am currently in the paying for experts stage haha and I pay a home warranty for any random breaks.   I value having the extra space as opposed to an apartment but I will look into an equity fund as you suggested I know nothing about those!

hm6x3ko,CrimsonTide2000,11/26/2021,1,100% military will be worth it yes! Granted its not for everyone though. Find an MOS you can use in the real world once you get out. Preferably something you enjoy. Im one of the people that wish every young person would go in the military thats how much of a positive effect it has on people overall. Once again though some people arent cut out for it but if you are debating on it on your own then yes it would be great decision. One of the best decisions I ever made 30 years ago lol.

hm707ti,darthrater78,11/26/2021,27,Did six years in the Air Force myself. I have relatives in all the branches and they all said in one voice Air Force.   I didnt continue my ASFC once I got out but the discipline and work ethic served me very well.   Words of advice stay clear of the traps! Dont get married dont get a brand new car stay away from the strip clubs (clubs in general)  and stay away from the dirtbags that drink to excess and do drugs. They WILL drag you down with them.

hm877md,Shacosclones,11/26/2021,1,Just a lpt: dont ever blindly trust anyone especially your parents. I know most people think that its good to because theyre your parent but be honest most of the time its a lazy easy out to looking into it yourself.  Now its fine to do but understand that going to 1 or 2 people about something means you can only hold them responsible and yourself.  Where as if you look into this stuff yourself you at least took an effort to not screw yourself over.

hm85rbc,sir_richard_head,11/26/2021,1,Lmao no  OP stands to lose about $1500 over the course os their recovery.  Lawyers working on contingency get 1/3 of the awarded damages.  No lawyer is going to take on a case for $500.  OP is going to be on $700/mo income.  That won’t even buy two hours of a lawyer’s time.  Further the employer does not have any obligation to accommodate beyond reasonability.  If there’s only 15 hours per week of light duty work available then the employer has no obligation to let OP do nothing while on the clock.    Your suggestion is as ridiculous as the lies about your experience with this.
hm8ogx8,asks_mrtgg_questions,11/26/2021,1,Yeah Im pretty sure I could make it work but have this nagging feeling that Im jumping the gun.

hm753b9,buildyourown,11/26/2021,1,How much does your dad have for retirement?  Save for retirement while young.   This sub tends to over stress emergency fund. If you have other ways of dealing with an emergency you dont need to have that cash sitting around.  I lived for years including owning an old house with never more than a months cash on hand.  Im just fine and never got too worked up floating an emergency on a a credit card for a month.

hm8htd7,SlowJamm,11/26/2021,1,I see your points but if youre worried about retaliation then making it an issue is the last thing you do. It has by far the highest chance of coming back to bite ya. I get this is reddit so the most logical response is always right.   Ive grown up in rough neighborhoods and theres a reason why people never ever call the police there. Thats how you get retaliated. If OP just forgets about it then its never his problem again. Switch banks and move on with his life with zero fear of anything.   This is just my opinion and what Id do. Im not saying your view is wrong.
hm77800,UncleMeat11,11/26/2021,1,> Still you’d be insane to pass up 7.12% risk free.  It isnt 7.12% risk free. It is 3.56% risk free (it adjusts after six months and you dont know what the adjustment will be).   And I dont think youd have to be insane. If you are in 100% equities because that is what risk profile you want then it doesnt make much sense to change course because of hunches.

hm89jpn,Buttigieg2032,11/26/2021,1,A little known truth but very well known by the banks themselves (I’m an executive director at a bank) is that senior citizens who own their house and live off social security are pretty much judgement proof and don’t actually have to pay back their debts…banks have to lend to them due to age discrimination reasons….but ya what your grandparents doing is a thing and not actually irrational.
hm7vtht,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,1,> pays out monthly interest of 2%  If this is true then I would stuff this account as much as possible.  2% per month is amazing returns.  > 2% seems ludicrously conservative for retirement investing no?  2% per year?  Yes.  You said 2% per MONTH... thats amazing.  > Is my logic sound?  Sure.  Thats what the PF Wiki Prime Directive Flow Chart endorses.  > Is this what you would recommend?   I would take 2% per month.  > Am I missing some hidden benefit of my employer option? (I have confirmed that I am not misunderstanding how the fund works!)  Well if youre not misunderstanding then youre probably mischaracterizing!  2% per month is rather unheard of!

hm75vgq,exconsultingguy,11/26/2021,1,Think of it this way in retirement you’ll withdraw enough for what you spend. Odds are you won’t have a mortgage and you won’t be saving because well you already saved for retirement. So unless you think tax policy is going to greatly increase tax rates and you’re also expecting to have higher **expenses** sans savings then yes 100% roth makes sense.   Otherwise you got half baked advice from a potential used car salesman. Remember financial advisors unless a fiduciary can tell you whatever they want. Right or wrong.

hm73zc0,jwc8985,11/26/2021,2,Same. Did 3 semesters of community college in my hometown taking care of the important classes (basketball weight lifting etc.). I knew my parents couldn’t afford for to pay for my tuition at a 4year school and I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I grew up nowhere near the coast but had dated a girl whose cousin was engaged to a guy in the Coast Guard.   It sounded interesting so I decided it was my best option to get out of my hometown experience something new and figure out what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. Plus my college would be paid for afterwards.  Joined in January 2005 did 4 years figured out a direction for my career got out finished college (Post 9/11 GI Bill took affect not long after I got out thankfully) and got into my career.  My time in the Coast Guard was much more difficult than I expected…I was right in the middle of Hurricane Katrina got diagnosed with depression (but great treatment for it for free) and had a shitty commanding officer for a bit. I also realize my experience wasn’t typical.   If I could redo it all over again though I would have probably tried for the Air Force since there are many more job/MOS options.

Youd be fine if you didnt so long as you have the discipline to do good things with the difference.  Youd also be fine if you did.  The balances are also low enough that they wont make a huge difference on your income to debt ratio for mortgage underwriting.  This is in the personal zone of personal finance.

From there kids will be going to college and this expenses will slow down retirement contributions.  Even if we stop for 20 years we will still have a good nest egg.

hm6spg3,PetraLoseIt,11/26/2021,2,My hunch is that on average the return in the market (average 10%-ish) is going to be bigger than the mortgage interest rate (3.25%).   So personally I am paying the minimum on my mortgage and investing the rest.  But for you guys I could see you for example splitting the monthly surplus: $1k/month towards the mortgage and the rest towards investments.   That way you would still have solid progress on your mortgage while at the same time also benefitting from being in the stock market for a longer time period.
hm7gm0n,HankiePankie315,11/26/2021,1,$11/week * 52 weeks in a year is $572. By 18 the kid could have ~ 16k (using 6% interest). No time like today to start saving for your kids college imo.   That said $11 fluctuations in weekly expenses eating this up is far more likely to happen than anything so I am with you in the sense that its splitting hairs.
hm8dkff,ShoopdaYoop,11/26/2021,1,Buying a set of winter tires & wheels makes the most sense.  AWD will be slightly better than FWD (when starting from a stop). Braking will be identical as the drivetrain does not enhance braking.  AWD will still be inferior to FWD with snow tires.  Not to mention its not the lack of going that causes crashes. Its the lack of stopping.  Youre going to go into a lot of debt just to obtain a sense of false confidence on slippery roads. Buy the wheels & tires instead.
hm79deo,aaaaij,11/26/2021,2,Absolutely! At just what income that falls depends on a lot of factors including your guess at how tax laws will change in the future making it impossible to really know where that threshold really is for you but it definitely exists.  The way progressive tax structures like the one we use in the US works is you pay a higher and higher effective rate as your income increases. As a result your lifelong tax burden is lowest if your taxable income is the same each year of your life. If your income varies widely from year to year your lifelong tax burden is more for the same total lifelomg income. Switching from Roth to pre-tax as their income increases is how people manage that for optimal tax efficiency
hm8h70k,wutzeeheck,11/26/2021,1,Also exceptions are made for primary residences. Those rules have nothing to do with general capital gains tax laws.

hm73mgh,LightAzimuth,11/26/2021,171,No. If the check wasnt cashed the money would have never left the account. So there is no money to return. Easily verified either way.

hm8kst4,LooksAtClouds,11/26/2021,1,Life insurance passes directly to the beneficiary. Its not part of her estate.     But a good estate attorney will tell you that. Find one soon.
hm7fcvy,CoffeeKadachi,11/26/2021,1,I mean I wouldn’t say it’s meaningless. It’s a good starting point when you make a variable amount.   Definitely not a hard and fast rule but obviously it’s something you’d adjust for your needs.

hm6x82f,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,>. If you’ve paid over 90% of what you owed in taxes last year you avoid the penalty usually.  This is NOT correct!  To fall under the safe harbor you have to have **100%** (110% of your prior year AGI was >=$150k) of your **prior year tax liability** *withheld* from your paychecks for the year. The 90% relates to your current year tax liability-- if you have at least 90% of your current years tax liability *withheld* from your paychecks you can also fall under the safe harbor.
hm8g15j,KBVan21,11/26/2021,2,My honest thought is he won’t steal. Simply because he used his social media to contact you. He would have to be a complete fucking imbecile to now steal from you after using his social media to ask you. If he is that stupid then you’re about to have a field day with him and the bank.   First things first screenshot that social media message so you have proof.   Secondly doesn’t your bank have 24 hour call centre? At this point it doesn’t matter which department you call you just want whichever manager is there so you can report this. Get the paper trail started as you want things documented.   Once that’s done call tomorrow and get the process started for the bank getting their house in order.   The guy likely is just stupid if he is a basic teller who saw your account and though to ask. He may genuinely be in financial hardship which makes people do crazy things but what he has done is so incredibly unethical and likely breaking several privacy laws that both he and your bank are gonna be hurting financially very shortly.

I did something dumb today and Im trying to figure out the best way to fix. Im switching my cell provider over to Google Fi and purchased a new phone today through the Pixel Pass. What I didnt grasp is that you can purchase the Pixel Pass through the Google Store and through Google Fi.   What I know now is that with Fi it seems like they do a soft credit check and you pay from an bank account monthly. Purchasing though the Google Store requires you to open a line of credit for financing.   Being the fool I am I got all the way through checkout and realized there was not an option to sign up for Google Fi. Got to poking around reached out to Fi support realized I went about things the wrong direction.   Soooo... I didnt complete the checkout though the Google Store and instead did everything through Fi. All is well except I now have an open line of credit Im probably never going to use.   I already have two other credit cards which I use on the reg but never carry over a balance. I also just bought a new house in the last 30 days. I dont particularly like having random lines of credit Im not using hanging out there but Im just not sure what is best to do with my mistake today.   Please help and thank you in advance!

hm75z49,alwaysmyfault,11/26/2021,-16,Pretty sure thats not how it works. If they did that it would become a cashiers check.
hm854yy,iced_out_pickle,11/26/2021,1,Good point! Weve got some decent furniture now nothing too fancy. I figured we would move in with what we have and slowly upgrade what we need over time. Some of that $1350 we have left over will likely go to paint trim epoxying the garage floor etc. but youre right I have no idea how to estimate or budget for all of that.
hm81ram,jimspokane,11/26/2021,1,Unpaid charge off is going to hurt you on a mortgage score resulting in an elevated interest rate or outright decline.  You can got down the debt validation route but that won’t buy you anything since that process is usually used to slow a collector down or avoid a lawsuit.  At this point you are that Target’s mercy as to how fast they work with you (or if they work with you at all) to resolve it.  Instead of sending a letter offering a PFD (which they probably won’t agree to delete that usually only works with third party collectors) why not send them the balance owed in the form of cashiers check and resolve it that way.  You can at least then show a copy to the mortgage underwriter and that may help your case.
hm8jfev,diatho,11/26/2021,1,Yeah. Then your dad is right. While its free money you need to find a way to build your efund/general savings. If you go for 6% then cut other expenses.
hm6tzpr,haggiebaby,11/26/2021,1,Thanks!  I kinda thought the money could be sheltered for 18 years. (\~8 years till they turn 18 plus 10 more).    But any idea if this can be directly rolled into an Inherited **Roth** IRA??  And even if that forces taxes now... part of me thinks thats worth it to have tax free growth for 18 years.  Ive spent hours searching for clear answers on possible options... and still unclear.
hm7b2zt,Weggooi987,11/26/2021,1,>Constructive dismissal  thank you for mentioning this I googled it and this might be quite relevant to OP (and interesting to me). And yes we have a similar rule in case of non-payment of wages (and recourse for damages) so I was not complete in my previous post.
hm898x6,NenetheNinja,11/26/2021,1,Thats what confused me to at first but I think this is like a cashiers check which would take the money out right away. Thats why they cant see if landlord actually cashed it after. Pretty sure you cant void a cashiers check you dont have either especially after a year.   What I would do is contact her banks fraud department figure out what bank landlord uses and have them contact that bank to see if the check was ever deposited. Best case landlord forgot. Worst case check was intercepted and cashed. Theyre supposed to check the IDs for checks but there are shady places (like those quick loan places) that wont. If thats the case the fraud department might be able to see where it was cashed and get the money returned that way. A Chase teller/customer service person wont be able to do that.

hm7kas2,AkaminaKishinena,11/26/2021,1,This happened to me years ago with a rent check. Chase was able to determine that the check was not cashed and put a stop payment on it. It was a hassle though because like you the money was withdrawn from my checking account. I would recommend you keep escalating the issue with customer service until they can prove to you that the check they cut and mailed to your landlord was actual cashed. Good luck I am so sorry.
hm7hyf9,DetN8,11/26/2021,1,> They are captured when the check id deposited/cashed by the receiver.   This is what my bank does. Its analogous to the olden days when the bank would mail you all of your cashed checks with your statment.

hm877e5,PotentialAfternoon,11/26/2021,1,Your dad is giving you a sensible advice.  401k match is “free” money that is accessible many decades from now.   How much to allocated between Cash savings vs investment is a tricky balance and there is never the right answer.    But I would personally consider your dad a wise person based on his advice. Take advantage of 401k match to a point but don’t over do it at expense of having emergency cash savings

hm7lp7g,NoProblemsHere,11/26/2021,1,That just means that the renter is using a service not that they arent liable if the service does not perform. In theory the renter pays the fees and then goes after the 3rd party to reimburse fees caused by their negligence. In practice of course things tend to be a lot murkier. It *is* a bit odd that the landlord didnt say anything until just now but IANAL so I have no idea if that would help OP in any way.

hm818p8,t-poke,11/26/2021,1,File a claim with your insurance let them deal with it.
hm8bian,Annonymouse100,11/26/2021,1,Don’t panic. Your best bet is probably to get everything filed in January 2022 (2019-2021). The IRS limit e-file services from late November to early January every year in order to update their system. I believe they are still fairly backlogged on paper returns and I was advised by my CPA to wait until January when they system is back on-line to file my back taxes because even with the wait it is quicker than they are getting back confirmation on paper filing.   https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/modernized-e-file-mef-status  In the meantime if you think you may owe money you can speak with a tax advisor about making a payment towards your 2021 tax liabilities before the end of the year in order to limit any penalties.   The important thing is not to let it become overwhelming. If your taxes are relatively simple you can likely still DIY but if they are overwhelming to you sometimes it is still better to just go ahead and pay a professional to get them done for you.

hm6v98m,OxideOrange,11/26/2021,2,Since the pandemic many people are looking outside their normal nine to five to keep afloat. Given your current status it might be good to look into a new adventure and expand your skill sets. Working remotely seems to offer more flexibility. I would suggest looking into side hustles like medical billing for instance or teaching online courses within your field if applicable could also benefit. Maybe see if your employer needs administrative work that needs help with. Many possibilities. It seems like your situation isn’t permanent as you just need recovery time.  Look into an Odd Job App (there are many out there) that may help you stay a float a bit longer and even find new interest and skills you have.
hm7irsy,Econ0mist,11/26/2021,1,53 is definitely not too late to start but it will probably require some significant lifestyle changes for her to allocate sufficient money into retirement savings.

hm8bdt4,statmos,11/26/2021,1,I’m not a tax professional but my understanding is that your parents may still owe a gift tax on the difference between $50 and the fair market value even if the “gift” was given through their company. That being said the lifetime gift tax exemption is several million dollars and the annual reporting threshold is $15k so they probably don’t owe or need to report anything.   Since this was effectively a gift your cost basis should be equal to the fair market value when you received the car and you only owe capital gains if you sell above that amount.

hm7qww6,spam20,11/26/2021,1,I work in retail banking. Depends on the system they use. A majority of banks will debit your account to issue the check and just assume it was received by the other party. There should be something to help reconcile and confirm the check was deposited/cashed. You might need to ask if you can speak to someone familiar with their online system. Front end people will just see funds were taken and check was issued. Online department should be able to dig a bit further to determine it cashed/deposited. *Should* is the key word. Best of luck.
hm88l12,footballer2323,11/26/2021,1,The free money from the company match is only available if you contribute the 6%.  Theres very few scenarios where you dont come out ahead by putting in that full 6%.  Id strongly suggest doing that.  If you really have only $1500 between you and the so-called emergency then building that up should be next.  With 52k less 6% you have over 4k per month to work with.  Since this is a new job your expenses are probably lower than this new salary and if you keep them low for a few months you can get your emergency fun to a level you feel comfortable.  Also with a new job you may be able to get some credit card (dont run a balance) that will also give you an emergency cushion if you ever need it.  The student loans will depend on the interest rate.  if its low pay them back as slow as they will allow and put that money in your tax advantaged 401k.  The contributions limits are annual and you will lose whatever you dont use.  Later in your career you will hopefully make more salary and you can pay the remaining loans then but you cannot go back and invest.  Use time to your advantage.  On the other hand if the student loan interest rates are high and you cannot consolidate for a low rate then you probably want to knock those out quickly.  This is about the only case where Id leave the 401k contribution at 6% and pour everything you can into eliminating the high interest loans.  Most financial advisers are glorified salesmen so dont worry what they recommend.  Most of their advice is garbage.

hm8kwea,tacotruck2112,11/26/2021,1,The website you linked is not from IRS (a preferred source for getting correct advice) however your link says the following:    An In-Service Withdrawal withdrawal is taken for personal use from an employer-sponsored retirement plan like a 401k while still employed **and age 59.5 or older**. Not all employer-sponsored plans allow in-service withdrawals.   If permitted the withdrawal **must meet certain requirements depending on whether the withdrawal comes from an employer contribution or employee contribution**.  I stand by my comment but would be happy to look at your SPD if you can link it here somehow.

The real bitch is that they sometimes don’t even pay your bill and they hit you with a return item fee. So I’m conclusion banks literally print money every Tuesday so keep a tab on your spending. You can always call them to reverse the fees if you qualify.

hm79m5p,Gunty1,11/26/2021,2,There is 4% of your salary being left on the table.  So he is wrong.   Bump it up and squirrel away to your savings to build up your emergency fund.  Run lean and suffer for a wee bit to make it happen easier to miss the money from the start than get used to the extra income and then try and dial back.
hm7yj44,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,Given your high income (and surprisingly high retirement account for your ages) Im not too concerned here.  A few questions:   - Transportation	$849 - what is this? Car loans gas and insurance?   - Home Maintenance - this seems high unless its an older house IMO    Per question #2 I feel like housing prices are still quite out of whack at this point. Houses are getting snapped up within days generally over list price. If youre not in a significant rush it may not hurt to slow down a bit. Moreover if the market goes topsy-turvy again with the new COVID-19 variant (Im not saying it will but it isnt 100% out of the question) things could get interesting again.

hm77lw9,jimspokane,11/26/2021,1,no that is not the way an AU works from a credit reporting standpoint.  The AU is reported the same as the account owner.  Account owner doesn’t pay or commits fraud the AU credit report takes a beating. Account is over 30% utilization AU takes a hit just like account owner.  The AU can certainly try to dispute but as long as the information is reported correctly the dispute won’t fly.  Best advice is don’t become an AU with anyone that isn’t a responsible credit user and certainly don’t commit fraud as an AU.  The only real difference between an AU and joint account holder is that the AU is not responsible for the management and payback of the card.  The rest of the equation is pretty much the same for both types of account holders.

hm7vp53,Tyrthalae,11/26/2021,1,I use Chase Bill Pay for a lot of things. In many cases (if recipient can’t be paid electronically) they cut a paper cheque and mail it but still withdraw funds immediately from your account. This is different than many other banks but is actually something I like personally. Also explains the confusion from many who don’t bank with Chase since Chase bills are paid from a segregated (bank operated) account. They make a few pennies per bill in keeping those funds segregated for hours/days. Or more / longer in your case!  Now: if the cheque was cashed you’d be able to see the image in online banking. I know this because I do it all the time (eg my monthly HOA fee is a paper cheque Chase cuts. I see the deposit image when it’s cashed.)  If Chase says it wasn’t cashed they should be able to stop payment it and you’ll get your money back. If they can’t stop payment it means it was cashed and they can figure out who cashed it - becomes a potential fraud case since landlord says he didn’t cash it so someone did …   Do that stop payment and then pay your landlord again (perhaps an in person cheque this one time to avoid hassle). If they’re willing to waive late fees after negotiating great but otherwise you may have a claim with Chase for the late fees I’m not sure how much traction you’ll get there but generally Chase will play ball on that if your landlord is willing to state to them that he didn’t get the cheque.  My 2.5 cents for what it’s worth.
hm6tlt2,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,1,Absolutely! Mine were just examples of the not so obvious ones.

Being paid to go to school is a huge stress relief and my experiences have really allowed me to grow as a person that I feel many people miss out on.  /e as for MOS I would do something 35 series linguist perhaps if you have an aptitude for it. You get paid extra scaling for language/fluency if I remember correctly. Can maximize your income since most likely joining as enlisted. On top of that youll most likely get a TS/SCI and you can leverage that when you return to the civilian world.   Id look into house hacking if you can take any college courses while youre active and use TA to cover it it will make a difference.

hm8g259,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,Home owners are liable for taxes on capital gains.  When you sell a house you take the price you sold it for and the price you bought it for and file taxes on the difference.  But there are several rules specific to houses that let you reduce or eliminate that capital gain.  The most common two are that if you buy another house with the gains you dont have to pay taxes and if you lived there for 2 out of the last 5 years you can reduce the capital gain buy 250k per person or 500k per married couple.  But those exceptions to capital gains are specific to house and do not apply to other forms of capital gains.

hm7e92o,vaguelyconcerned,11/26/2021,1,Its free money. This is the official order that a majority of financial advisors recommend:  1/ Invest up to 401k employer match (in your case 6% of income)  2/ Emergency savings to cover 3 months expenses in a high yield savings account  3/ High interest debt (credit cards personal loans some private student loans)  4/ Maximum annual 401k contribution (18k for most people)  5/ Low interest debt like federal student loans  6/ Personal investments in IRA or other investment account
hm7394k,whatsmynamema,11/26/2021,2,Ive already gone through my budget and I cant spend any less than I currently do it leaves me roughly 400 per month to put towards debts. My issues seem to be the amount of unexpected expenses.  I use to be pretty bad with impulse purchases but In the past two/three months I havent gone over budget at all been really strict but made little to no progress due to external factors which is pretty frustrating because despite all my hard work im making no progress. Things like family/friends weddings/hotels household appliances breaking down car troubles etc.  In the long term 400 a month would be enough to pay of debts although it usually ends up much lower than that by the end of the month. its also pretty overwhelming to think of the scale of debt and how little a dent an entire months savings even makes.  Ill definitely have to look further into it do you have any recommendations ?
hm7apyd,Aiorr,11/26/2021,-2,>Yes there is. Once the loan enters repayment you have a minimum payment either based on the payment plan you selected or the standard 10 year repayment plan.  I maybe wrong but dont you have to specifically sign up for repayment plan?  >I commented on your incorrect representation of how the loan would impact their credit score.  payment history makes large chunk of score but proportion is still a factor.  My FICO monthly report showed 50\~80 score tank out of blue back when I just started to pay student loan with message Proportion of loan balances to loan amounts is too high

hm86p1b,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,Capital gains taxes is based off how much the value of the asset goes up when you bought it. Just because he bought it for $50 doesn’t mean the asset was worth $50. The value of the vehicle has likely gone down since he bought it. Not liable for capital gains taxes.

hm8jyos,SpaceFaceMistake,11/26/2021,1,I’d say just put money aside until you find a broker or exchange you want to use.  If you don’t have investing or trading or any kind of finacial document or accounting or business finance or stockmarket knowledge and or insight then you need to study some. Not all aspects and depends what you want to do. If you want to invest only then using a personal broker is probably best but if you want to you can do it yourself and Broke directly with the exchanges. Cutting out the fees for the brokering service from another person.   However if your not well tuned to the stock market from reading charts to the tech analysis to the economic side to the finacial side to BE ABLE to find new markets regularly that go up and grand solid returns where brokers can and or nice dividends then having a broker can definitely be worth the money/investment as their knowledge will grow your capital and you won’t feel as many emotions when things go sour or the markets dip for any reason.

If you desparately need to get out do it as cheaply (and safely) as possible. You can find some people who need to sublet rooms or are looking to rent a room in a home they own. Don’t get a $1300 apartment on your pay. You can get a second job but working 80hours to pay rent may affect your mental health more than living with a sick mom. Find a cheap place get out while keeping yourself safe and healthy
hm8bcap,nerfherder998,11/26/2021,1,Everything he said but I still think you need to max out that match. Early withdraw from a 401k is a 10% penalty but that penalty applies only if you have a real emergency. If you can keep it in until the match vests you come out ahead anyway. I am not saying you should take early withdrawal lightly and get in the habit of treating 401k like a piggy bank.

hm81qlq,GreedyNovel,11/26/2021,1,3.25% is very low and keep in mind that inflation reduces the cost of your future payments so your true interest cost (right now at least) is likely negative.  So if there were ever a time to *not* pay early this is probably it. The question then becomes what do you do with the extra cash and thats an entirely different topic. But I wouldnt rush to pay down principal at any rate.
hm8qj6i,IDontKnowWho6598,11/26/2021,1,I don’t think it’s bad advice you’ll build up an emergency fund faster and focus on paying off your debt.

Rather adjust step 3 or 4b on W-4 such that you effectively turn off income tax withholding for the rest of the year.  For next year you can put $100k on step 4b. It basically says the first $100k on top of standard deduction is not taxable income.

hm79420,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,2,> in the event of her death I would be liable for any balance remaining on the card.  This is inaccurate.  Look youre probably worrying over nothing.  If mom has good credit and adds you as an AU on her CREDIT card then YOU get her good credit that is tied to the card added to YOUR credit report.  If moms credit is bad then the bad will also get added to your report.  But its easy for you to remove because youre just an AU.  So unless Mom has bad credit just leave it be.
hm8e7na,wheniaminspaced,11/26/2021,1,I guess it depends on what your goals and motivations are and what your father is willing to potentially deal with.  If it were me this is what I would do and the conversation I would have  Dad tax free retirement contributions early in life have the largest return on investment and make saving for retirement a lot easier than contributions further down the road.  Instead of building up cash savings I want to make some early retirement gains to allow for more flexibility later in life.   If I take this route are you comfortable helping me out if my situation changes.  This is an line of thought that can be backed up by many sources.  Early retirement contributions do substantially more to set you up later in life than later contributions to hit the same number starting later requires substantially larger contributions.    That said as most everyone else in this thread has pointed out you currently have effectively no safety net of your own but if your father is comfortable playing the safety net and knows that is what he is doing I would would put every cent I could into retirement savings.  It super easy to cut retirement contributions later in life it is much harder to catch up.  There isnt really a wrong answer here both strategies carry merit.  My last add is this your carrying 3k in monthly expenses that is a lot for a single individual.  You probably can knock that number down and I would try to.
hm80oyw,zhonzhon,11/26/2021,1,if you have uninsured drivers coverage you can file a claim with your insurance.  or it might be covered under your collision policy as well.
hm7ed06,vrtigo1,11/26/2021,1,If youre using bill pay my understanding is they send a check and the funds stay in your account until the check is cashed the same as if you wrote a check yourself.  So assuming thats accurate cant you just look at your Chase accounts statements to see if the check has cleared?  If thats not how Chase works (i.e. they take the funds out of your account immediately and send a money order) then if they cant provide proof that it was cashed then based on what they told you the funds shouldve returned to your account after 90 days.  So again take a look at your statements to see if the funds came back.  If they did reissue the payment to your landlord.  If they didnt get Chase to refund the payment since its been more than 90 days and then reissue the payment to your landlord.  I suspect Chase will magically find some proof that the check was deposited which you can then give to your landlord.
hm80w63,GreedyNovel,11/26/2021,1,I inherited a house as well not that long ago. I eventually decided to put it up for sale its under contract now.

What party is responsible to take the next action and how can you follow up with them.  Basically just dont give them an excuse to brush you off like they seem to be doing.  If they cant give you an ETA on when youre going to be paid Id tell them thats unacceptable and demand to speak to a supervisor.  Keep going up the chain.  If you have to tell them youre going to reach out to the state labor board and/or an employment attorney.  Hate to burn bridges but if an employer is not treating an employee not being paid as an urgent issue that is a huge problem.

hm7zui6,teefdoll,11/26/2021,1,Well Im a baker. The job description has lifting 30/50 pounds but the only thing I cant do is put things in/out of the oven. Or pull things off the rack. Basically everything else I can do.. so I dont know if that changes anything.
hm828z8,Coin_Boi,11/26/2021,1,After your monthly expenses and maximizing contributions are you still able to put money aside in savings to build an emergency fund?  If you can max out your contributions and still live comfortably then you should definitely at minimum meet your company match otherwise your losing the money your company is offering.
hm8l2gy,Immediate-Joke8605,11/26/2021,1,Oh wow good to ask. I don’t know what Roth IRA is but it seems like I can invest 6k every year. Cool I will make account next week and consider 401k as well. Thanks!
hm8524y,Hundred_Acres,11/26/2021,1,I am not an expert on this stuff by any means so take my advice with a grain of salt - but I think that refinancing is better only if it lowers the cost of the loans overall. If the cost of the loans doesn’t reduce and the interest increases then you aren’t getting any true benefit out of a lower monthly interest unless the monthly payment is significantly lower to the point where you can over pay and not only kill the interest accrued but the loan faster.     It is hard to say without numbers but as I look at it for refinancing it can really be dependent on what you are looking to get out of it.

The cc company thats giving the balance transfer promo does it also apply to a convenience checks written as well? If so you could write a check and the other cc shouldnt know its a balance transfer and charge you a fee.
hm80qsu,WillyValentine,11/26/2021,1,I am a Nigerian prince.   Never find someone online and never use any insurance agent advisor. I advise doing some homework to see what you believe your strategy should be. Then and only then find a fiduciary.  Even then a fiduciary means they are legally responsible to protect your assets.  It doesnt mean they are any good.
hm6x0vv,football35249,11/26/2021,1,Its unlikely this is a good idea for you. In general single family homes make bad investment properties being a landlord isnt something you just casually do its a job that takes work and effort and theres a lot that can go wrong that you need to be financially prepared for and a house in a good neighborhood does nothing for you if you dont plan to live in that neighborhood again. Cash out refi isnt inherently bad its a tool to access cash with a bit of increased risk because its secured by real property. But you dont seem to have done any leg work here to give us actual numbers to work with so its hard to say any of this for sure.
hm8sk13,realglueboy,11/26/2021,1,Thats what I told them. They basically just steamrolled past it and said they couldnt give me my money back.

hm8jpxo,MDfoodie,11/26/2021,1,401k contributions do reduce MAGI so you can easily dip below the Roth IRA limit for MFJ.  Then you don’t have to worry about rollovers into Roth IRA.  At high incomes it’s more often than not better to reduce taxable income…so max out your 401k (both you and wife).
hm80vit,t-poke,11/26/2021,1,Do you have full coverage insurance?  If you do call your insurance company and let them deal with it. They can go after the person who hit you if they’re found.  If you have liability only then you’re basically screwed. You’ll have to pay out of pocket for a new car or repairs. **IF** the police find them you can sue but if they’re driving without insurance and running from accidents odds are they don’t have any money and are judgement proof.

If you score above 75 on asvab you can take the nuke test which opens you up to more money opportunities in the service as well.   Find these jobs in the Army  they exist there too. You can come out making a ton of money and debt free.  When you’re in Boot Camp and getting started do everything in your power to avoid getting into loans because you’re probably going to get deployed. Take advantage of saving as much money as you can through the military credit unions and just hoard all your cash. Be frugal and it will go along way and you’ll be in a great position for five years from now.

hm7gcrp,neverfucks,11/26/2021,1,Sure but every financial strategy has some risk associated with it. Holding 20k in cash exposes you to some type of black swan severe inflation event risk for example on top of the known opportunity cost of not investing it. In the case of using a HELOC as an e-fund youre making the reasonably low risk bet that an emergency may occur or your HELOC may get closed on you but they very likely will not both happen at the same time.

hm6s716,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,Losses always offset gains and after that you can deduct $3000 of losses from your regular income. The rest carries over to the next year  So for e.g. $30k capital gains $100k capital losses. You dont pay taxes on those gains subtract $3k from your income and roll over $67k for next year.

Is the taillight damage repairable or is the actual housing cracked?  Structural damage is unlikely unless it was a bit more significant. If your bumped is completely off-kilter (look at it during the day time) then it may have been enough force to engage the bumper support but I honestly wouldnt overthink it.

hm7zlhx,myassholealt,11/26/2021,1,Not for chase. Chase takes the money out as soon as you submit payment. Then they cut a physical check and mail it out and its up to the usps to get it to the recipient. Ive had many checks lost in the wild and had to call and request stop payment and resend payment.
hm8kl0g,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,People don’t usually sell cars for $4500 under market value either.
hm8fr1t,Fondren_Richmond,11/26/2021,1,You are likely going to lose this battle with your landlord and should probably prepare to draft a second check then ask Chase to stop payment on the original one you sent. Earlier this fall my apartments management company changed about a week before the end of the month and informed us that the payment site that they require us to send all payments through as per the lease was immediately unavailable and advised us to set up payments with the new company. I set up bill pay in my bank to send rent checks to them which would arrive by the end of the month. The new rental company set up the new payment site a few days later but I emailed them advising I had already set up bill pay and had them  clarify that they would be able to credit my account once they received it. They said they would but of course they didnt claimed to have not seen the check until they called me back mid-month and asked me to pick it up and after I had already sent a second payment through the new system.
hm8s3bj,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,True. Thats why I only corrected that part of your reply.   However to be completely accurate youd need to specify that you have to live in *and own* the house being sold for 2 of the previous 5 years to be eligible for the $250k/$500k capital gains exclusion.
hm89npv,Garet44,11/26/2021,1,I regret not joining the Air Force you should look into that option and see if you can make it work or if youd even be interested. The Army will not live up to your expectations (at least it didnt to mine). This is a huge organization and lets just say the smartest people get out after one or maybe 2 contracts. The leadership is not that great and youll constantly find yourself in pretty lousy situations and regularly leave your comfort zone. Please dont fool yourself into thinking this profession is without sacrifices mental and physical. It beats being homeless in prison or being dead though not that Ive been the last one but Ive been close enough. The Army can be a good foundation for the rest of your life no doubt about that. Youll learn valuable skills learn a lot about yourself and there are plenty of programs to make the Army work for you if you can network while youre in. As for finding something worth putting your time into the Army wont help much with that while youre in. There are times when youll be busy and there are times when all you do is wait but it never seems that youre being very productive. Its always training that no one really takes seriously enough or running around like a chicken with its head cut off doing seemingly arbitrary tasks. Oh and lots of details. When you get higher rank it just gets even more stressful.
hm8mzzv,MDfoodie,11/26/2021,1,I do. Many of them require direct deposits from an employer which can be a limiting factor.
hm86xsp,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,As someone who rents from landlords I do not trust - I pay with a check so I have indisputable proof. Once they cash it I have a picture of the check - front and back - accessible in my bank account. That proves they cashed it when and where.
hm6wrkm,EvangelineRain,11/26/2021,2,I think the answer to your question ultimately depends on the purpose of the calculation.   Assets minus liabilities I think will generally include retirement and non-retirement accounts without regard to taxes and penalties that would have to be paid to liquidate them. But obviously that’s a limitation to the usefulness of that calculation.   I don’t know the answer to whether future alimony and child support payments would be considered a liability. I think it would be relevant to any sort of income calculation but my gut says it’s not a debt for net worth purposes generally speaking (any more than your future food bill is). Back child support/alimony owed would be a debt though. But I’m interested in what others have to say on that because if it were instead a judgment to be paid out in installments (equivalent to your child support order) then that would be a liability that would offset assets in a net worth computation.
hm7c7my,tuxed,11/26/2021,1,Not really. At the end of the year your provider will tell you how much you contributed for the year and if you made a traditional 401(k) contribution you can deduct that from your income.  But seeing as you probably won’t be contributing much to your 401(k) this year waiting out until January 1st is not going to hurt you.
hm7gfdf,sweadle,11/26/2021,1,If you cant find proof of the payment coming out of your account or the check cashed write them a new check.
hm8qh0y,pound-town,11/26/2021,1,People often fail to realize how good armed services pay is - imagine going in at 18 and working 20 years and retiring at 38. Like holy shit that’s good. Did you make a lot? Maybe not in dollar amounts but my armed services friends can literally spend every dime they make. I have to save for 30+ years of life after retirement and the insane cost of insurance after 55 and supplemental after 65. If I could turn back time I would be in the armed services in a second.
hm8gms7,trueoctopus,11/26/2021,1,Close Reddit and Screenshot EVERYTHING. Your bank app your receipt from that day. The facebook message the facebook profile EVERYTHING!!. Then print it all and bring copies to the bank TOMORROW (if they close for weekends Monday). Be waiting outside when they open and speak to the manager and only the manager. Not a teller or a secretary. In the meantime if this is a big bank Call their CS Line tonight and have them lock all accounts for potential fraud. I hope you have money or credit elsewhere if you go with this option. Legally the teller had no access to your account be technologically he does.
hm8fb43,93195,11/26/2021,1,It may not go up a ton if she has a great driving record.  As you said the car counts more than the driver.  But the driver counts too.  It certainly won’t go down and almost certainly will go up at least some.  Remember the driver coverage won’t just be for OP’s car it wil be for any car the covered driver uses including rentals.

hm747ye,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,Technically you are violating the rules claiming exempt (it says something along the lines of you had no tax liability last year and or this year) but chances are they wont go after you.  I already started doing my taxes... Amazon had H&R block (w/o state) on sale for $18. Plugged in all my numbers and estimated the last 3 paystubs imported my investment gains/losses from Quicken and got a pretty good idea of what my tax liability is going to be.  Based on this info there would be absolutely nothing wrong in adjusting the credits on your W4 to get to $0 refund or even a small amount owed within the underpayment penalty safe harbor.  And yea it depends on how your HR processes it. Mine is online through ADP so it should take effect with no processing delay.

hm7milt,thegreatgazoo,11/26/2021,1,But thats exactly what happened to a lot of people in 2008.   And interest rates are bound to go up. They have to. 3% mortgages and 7% inflation isnt sustainable. In 2007 I was making over 6% in a money market.
hm8fgxq,RubyRidgebackmomma,11/26/2021,1,Yes of course they want to know so they can charge you. But they can’t deny the claim if the person was not already specifically excluded from the policy.
hm875vz,dmooortin,11/26/2021,1,Not sure about yours but I have payed my rent with Venmo before to get the sign on bonus for a new card and it worked perfectly fine.

hm6tj8o,boxsterguy,11/26/2021,3,> I had a similar situation with my daughter and any SS money not spent by the time she turned 18 had to be paid back.  You got a source on that?  Because thats very much *not* what Ive found in any of the SSA documentation on survivors benefits and in fact they recommend saving the money if you dont need to spend it on essentials (they recommend saving for education but that doesnt have to mean a 4 year university).
hm6x1dj,kaijubooper,11/26/2021,1,I have a similar situation with my mom although she hasnt had a medical issue where she needed to be hospitalized recently. Please make sure you are taking care of yourself and setting boundaries about what you can and cannot do. Do not agree to take care of her at home after discharge from the hospital if you are not willing / able to be her caretaker.  Talk to the hospital social worker. There are more resources out there besides your moms assets - it sounds like she will qualify for Medicaid if she has less than $2k in assets. The value of her home shouldnt count towards that if shes over resources there has to be a spend-down but paying some medical bills should help with that. Medicaid will pay for assisted living and since shes in the hospital they should help expedite a placement into assisted living.   Medicaid can also help pay for some medical debt I believe if it was incurred in the last three months. The hospital should have financial assistance available for any bills not covered by Medicaid.  I spent months trying to get help for my mom after my dad passed away and the advice I heard from several people including a lawyer is that its easier to get help for an elderly parent if they are in the hospital vs if they are at home. The state my mom lives in basically wont do anything as long as shes not clearly mentally incapacitated even though she pees and shits in her clothes and on the floor and has to call the EMTs every time she falls.  I finally had to leave my mom on her own because I couldnt take it anymore. I couldnt get her approved for in-home help through Medicaid and she wouldnt agree to pay for private in-home care. My mom is not wealthy by any means but is a few hundred dollars over the $2k resource limit and I cant get her to spend it down. I dont have POA so I cant do anything about that. Im just waiting for her to be hospitalized or worse and Im really fucking pissed that my only options are to sacrifice my life or wait until she has a medical emergency.  I dont have enough money to pay for in-home care am an only child and felt immense pressure to make sure my mom was taken care of even though my mental health suffered a lot. I do think I did everything I could to get help for her but had to finally leave to take care of myself but Im still really angry and upset about this situation and that theres little support for families going through this when the elderly parent is being unrealistic and uncooperative.
hm7dxm3,DeaconPat,11/26/2021,1,Most rental agreements/contracts specify the tenant is responsible for payment of rent on the agreed upon schedule as specified in the agreement. This makes it the tenants responsibility to ensure payment reaches the landlord (or agent specified in the agreement) on the date.   The tenant chose to use a third party agent to make the payment. Unless the tenant can secure evidence of delivery from the agent to the landlord the tenant is on the hook for a late payment. Showing a check was cut and mailed (now involving a fourth party in this instance) is not usually evidence of payment - unless the check was cashed.

hm8k2um,jaded_lady06,11/26/2021,1,I was in for 10 years and heres my thoughts:  If youre a woman dont do it. You will most likely experience a level of harassment and abuse that is insane.  If you cant take abuse i.e. being screamed at being told to do something by person one then asked to do another thing by person 2 start doing said task then being screamed at why you havent finished task 1 go to complete task 1 by person 1 then after going back to working on task 1 have person 2 come and scream at you threaten you with UCMJ and article 15 action for insubordination because task 2 isnt done yet...   If youre not a gym rat dont do it... I know since Ive gotten out the regs have changed but they will still run you through the ringer just for shits n giggles...  Theres a very long list of scholarships that you can apply to or start small with a local community college. If you do well (and if the college takes part in it) you should be invited to join PTK (Phi Theta Kappa). Its an honor society for outstanding students.   And if youre still insisting on joining the Army study the regs first and go in with knowledge. Theres actually a study guide that can be found online. Just Google us army study guide and itll give you the basics of basic training and such. If you cant tolerate heat much I suggest you do a winter/spring rotation in basic too.

hm8qkvo,BG_1952,11/26/2021,14,Go into the bank on Monday--dont do this over the phone.  Take time off from work if you have to.  Ask to speak to a bank manager about a confidential matter.  Do not provide details until you know you are speaking to someone in authority.  Give them the details.  A person so desperate to ask a customer for money could take the next step and do something worse.  Dont be persuaded by others asking you to have pity.  The whole thing could be a con or it could be worse.
hm7fyie,HiddenLeafPervySage,11/26/2021,1,I would say go for it but I would tell you to go to the Air Force. I’m in the Army and only joined cause I was “too fat” for the Air Force but the Army let me pick my exact job. I worked in a really hot field in the IT industry and I’m using the Army as a stepping stone to a 6 figure salary. You’re still young so you’d get out at 23 and be very well off if you save and pick a good MOS so if you do go for it do your research!!! Recruiters will literally try to sell you anything

Then the electric secondary heat kicks in.
hmc5i4r,rave_master555,11/27/2021,1,I think that with your work experience I would look into applying for a Fortune 500 company or the public sector. If you have a bachelors degree on top of your experience you could be making about $70k-$80k a year at least. I really recommend applying for local state and federal government jobs instead of non-profit organizations because not only would you potentially gain better experience but you will also have a pension usually good work-life balance possibly make more money have the possibly of tuition reimbursement for a masters degree steady pay raises for ten years (step increments) sometimes you also may receive cost of living raises on top of your step increments possibly of applying for promotions job security union perks and protection etc.   Be careful with non-profits. They tend to pay you quite lower than what you are truly worth and raises tend to be leas often too. Avoid startup companies if you can as well (for the same reason).
hmcfpqn,oldfatandslow,11/27/2021,1,I was that guy at one point. I was offered and agreed to a retention contract that gave me +150% salary over two years (50% at end of year one +100% at end of year two). Super worthwhile for me.
hmauq1c,NoodleDoodleGirl,11/27/2021,1,The old rule is you shouldn’t buy a house more than 3x what you earn but this is dependent on the your other debt and the taxes and cola in the area you are living. Without knowing your situation I would say $450k price based on your total income would put you in a position of being stretched too thin unable to continue to build savings and in a position of imminent default if you have an interruption in your income stream. This is coming from someone in the mortgage industry for 20+ years.
hmbx7hh,MovieJunior,11/27/2021,1,Yes.  Crypto is a weird space but the odds of you making enougb routinely on those investments to beat CC interest is pretty low and it’s just as likely it plummets hard too.   I wouldn’t wager any investment on CC interest rate.

hmclalk,cownan,11/27/2021,1,Thanks fear is a big weakness for me in investing. Ive always been a buy-and-hold kind of investor and when I see my peers make big moves I start to worry and get fearful. I dont think Ive been particularly greedy I just want to make my average returns and be ready for retirement when the time feels right.  Another wrinkle to the equation is that I havent lived in the family home in ten years so on the sale Id need to pay long term capital gains which would be substantial (to me at least). I think Im just going to hold firm for now theres nothing really pushing me to make a move other than my own uncertainty

hmbiu4n,OperaticIguana,11/27/2021,1,A general recommendation is to have no more than 20% of a portfolio in a single stock. The same rule should apply to your employers stock as well. So you should consider strategies to sell as much as possible and diversify.  This is likely a scenario where its worth talking to a CPA (certified public accountant) about how to minimize tax burden when diversifying.
hmb8235,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,You would have to itemize to deduct a charitable donation of that amount and the donation would need to be to a qualifying organization. I dont think an individual would qualify. This is just a gift.
hmc6xqj,Nova_Nightmare,11/27/2021,1,Uh no. Most jobs are at-will and they can make any reason (almost) to let you go. They could say your job hunting during work hours and let you go.

hmc0sgs,johnnys_sack,11/27/2021,1,Dont take a pay cut. At least tell them the offer isnt high enough and see if theyll go to 55k or so. Assuming similar benefits.
hmcns6e,beetle1736,11/27/2021,1,My understanding is that you can put money towards it at any point in the life of the loan and once you get to that 80% loan to value mark done with PMI just call bank to make sure that insurance policy gets cancelled.    separate circumstance but related-  wife and I just refinanced to get better rates and cut life of loan refinance required an appraisal.  In our case appraisal came in quite a bit higher than when we bought house a few years ago.  So in our case were getting rid of the PMI by way of increased property value vs putting money down.
hmch91v,PetraLoseIt,11/27/2021,1,She definitely needs to start tracking her expenses and income/sales *now* and do some work to get her records for the past as accurate as they can be. Also if paying the extra taxes might be a problem: start saving for them now by setting aside any income shes making from now until March or so. Going forward have her set side a safe percentage of her income for this.    If she does keep doing this you guys may need to start paying quarterly estimated taxes from 2022 onwards. See the [IRS FAQ](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/estimated-tax).

hmbggoc,tjmille3,11/27/2021,1,Weed and feed fertilizer will kill all of your grass if it doesnt specifically have your grass type on the label. If you dont have rain gutters they are good investment especially if you have flower beds or anything up close to the house. Putting up a fence is a lot more expensive than you think. Home warranties arent worth the money and will try to get out of fixing anything they can. If you live close to lots of oak trees plan to tent your house for termites at least once every 10 years (at least in Florida anyways). Always call 811 before digging because stuff like fiber cables are usually only about an inch or 2 underground. This is the stuff Ive learned.
hmc06z6,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1,Q3 is 9/15 and Q4 is 1/18  So yes actually in your case it can help. Lookup IRS form 2210 and the method to calculate with varying income.  However if you can bump up withholding in your last 2-3 paychecks it is a much smoother process.

hmc37zb,ionlydrinkIPAs,11/27/2021,1,Having 20% down isn’t really important in the current market as far as financing goes (but will obviously make you more competitive). Plenty of people are buying with 3% down or going FHA with 3.5% down and credit scores in the mid-upper 600s.
hmbquka,lizgross144,11/27/2021,1,This is a terrible idea. Sounds like she doesn’t have the experience or ability to represent your interests well. This is a classics “don’t mix business and family” situation.   If your wife needs ideas of how to tell her you could say that if anything goes wrong in the transaction you don’t want to be in conflict with her.  Edit to add: we bought new construction (home was listed and construction was already well underway) and still used a realtor. I would do it that way again unless we were completely contracting a new build from scratch.
hmb4gel,PurpleParrotFish,11/27/2021,1,I’m a 22 (almost 23) year old who got married at 21. Marriage is cheaper than being single in many ways. For one rent can be combined and you can easily get a 1 BR apartment instead of a 2 BR typically used in roommate situations. Food is also combined which is cheaper. You can also pull from 2 incomes for big purchases like one car needs replaced or one person has a medical expense. My husband and I recently got a house with a mortgage which we never could have been approved for individually. Plus you will still have one income if one person looses a job or looses income in some way. The advice your sister gave of making sure the other person can support themselves is what my mom said too though. My husband and I did it for a year and it wasn’t worth it. We spent so much extra money on rent just to spend all our time at one apartment or the other. My mom said it’s good to make sure the other person is responsible enough to help provide for the family which is hard to tell if you were both supported by parents before getting married. I do have a cousin who got married at 20 after never living alone before and her husband has never worked consistently since and used his degree. It’s been a huge money struggle for her. They are 30 something now. I think this is the type of situation my mom and your sister worry about.

hma3yat,Pezpal,11/27/2021,1,The ones I’ve wored with do. I’ve seen them question a buyer about the $80 he withdraws from his account every week and find out that’s his weed money. They didn’t care they were looking for an actual financial obligation but they ask about patterns of spending for sure.  That’s how they decide whether you’re a good risk or not. If you’re regularly spending money on hookers and meth you’re probably not getting a mortgage.
hm9zfwb,fullactualization,11/27/2021,1,Do you think you’ll make more money in the future than you do today (I would hope so)? If so Roth IRA is the most logical option to choose - the money that is contributed into it will GROW and not get taxed far in the future at the (hopefully) much higher amount. I personally contribute up to the annual limit - I had sufficient amount of money outside of my paycheck so I was comfortable contributing 100% of my money earlier in the year and then scaling that down after I approached the limit (my employer keeps matching every paycheck as well) I wanted my money to be invested earlier and thus grow faster. It’s up to you how much you want to invest - how much do you have saved up and are you planning on any major expenses? (Eg. Buying a house? Medical expenses? Car? Children?). After you think through that decide on how much you think makes sense for you guys.
hmag6g4,Woody1918,11/27/2021,1,Ha! No I don’t think I can change it.  But if I did have that much power first I would change a few other things about the job and second I would be making enough money to not even have to ask this question! 😂😂 - ahhh the problems of the middle class

hma547u,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,You mention you have $67k net after deductions....whats your taxable income? Im guessing youre below the top of the 12% bracket ($83550 for married filing jointly)?    Traditional vs roth is a funny thing roth sounds great - and as long as they dont change the rules on them before you reach retirement they can help protect you from other tax changes in/before retirement but generally speaking traditional is better for *most* income levels.    Look at it this way with todays brackets you have to make more than $109450 to pay more than 12% tax as married filing jointly (this is the top of the 12% + standard deduction). So even if you defer tax (use traditional 401k) you have to withdraw more than $109450 *while in retirement* to be taxed higher than your contributions are being taxed today.    However theres more than that....when you contribute to a retirement account those dollars come off the top. Youre comfortably in the 12% bracket which means every dollar you contribute is taxed at 12% (if Roth) or deferred (if Traditional). When you withdraw money in retirement the first $25900 is tax free (standard deduction) then the next $20550 is taxed at 10% only. Only after that do you start paying 12%.    So even with say $85k gross income married filing jointly all your contributions can be deferred via Traditional contributions and you pay *less than* 12% tax on all withdrawals up to $46450 per year. Only then (for the next $39k you withdraw to hit that $85k number I said first) do you start to pay 12% tax which is the same as you wouldve paid if you used Roth from the beginning.    tldr - Having a mix of both is best for maximum flexibility but as far as paying taxes go Traditional will most likely be better for you *on average* unless you plan to have $150k+ in retirement income or so. So yes Roth IRA + 401k is too heavy on Roth IMHO....go with Traditional 401k to get a 12% tax break now (and keep maxing the Roth IRA) and barring significant tax reforms (it could totally happen but cant be predicted this far out) youll be better off in retirement.
hmcjugx,Real_garden_stl,11/27/2021,1,Would be 12k now? Do your property taxes not go up or am I reading this incorrectly?
hm9mg5j,thentangler,11/27/2021,0,So you are saying you get back the extra 15% or so when you do your returns….. even if that were the case you still aren’t getting the money you need right now for the relocation etc… Again….why must you pay tax on an amount that is committed to help you move.
hm90d5j,ZijoeLocs,11/27/2021,1,Its more like a legal loophole that the agencies take advantage of. Because financial debt is tied to ones social security number they can use that to look up immediate family members and their contact information (just addresses and phone numbers)  You paying on (and subsequently becoming responsible for) the deceased persons debt is the lowest effort and most cost effective avenue the Agency can take. They can only do it with immediate family members however (children siblings grandchildren). Legally they can get your contact information to confirm the death of the owner of the debt but really they use it to hassle you  Option B is they basically just write it off on their taxes. Depends on the original debtor agency amount and type of debt. They lose out on collecting interest but thats really it  Option C is the nuclear option. They can seek to collect from the estate of the deceased which is more emotionally traumatizing than youd think. Before the deceased possessions can be passed on to the family (unless explicitly stated in the will) the original debtor or the collection agency can get first dibs. House car jewelry books electronics. Anything of notable value. However this can be fought in court by the family but its a very emotionally draining process
hmbsaxw,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,You should not lie on your tax return-- take all of the business expenses youre legally able to. Im not sure how youre proposing to make your income look high on your taxes. For example reducing your taxable income by making retirement account contributions wont affect your loan approval chances.  You do need to be aware that the underwriting process is much more stringent for self-employed individuals and theyre probably going to want to see a minimum of 2 years of tax-returns showing that the business income is steady or increasing.
hmbssjd,lizgross144,11/27/2021,1,As others have suggested there may be many other ways to find cheaper transportation. I’d also try to have an honest conversation with your mom to determine what if anything is expected of you at this wedding other than being a guest. Maybe part of why she wants you to rent a car is to help with errands/setup and she hasn’t communicated that. All of this can come out when you explain the “good news” that you’ve found cheaper transportation options. If it turns out the car is needed for *her* purposes… then she can pay for it.

hmcoymt,IceCreamforLunch,11/27/2021,1,$70/mo on a $14k balance is a 6% interest rate which is pretty terrible. Set aside at least three months living expenses into a separate high yield savings account and then put the rest toward the car loan.

hmc24qi,SoraUsagi,11/27/2021,1,When my wife and I bought a house we were making a little bit less than you.  But we also got it in 2013 when the market recovered.

hmbmau6,cadmiumredlight,11/27/2021,1,You could be paying too much. It depends on a lot of factors.

Short answer yes if the numbers are right dont go past that tier.   Long answer if its really true find another bank. You should be getting more interest not less as your funds increase..
hmb9nnd,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,Generally people are referring to gross income in the situation you describe. However when actually sitting down and writing out a budget you should consider your net income after taxes to make sure everything works.   I think the reason we speak in terms of gross income so often is that many personal finance decisions will impact your tax burden.   Eg. How much you allocate towards your 401k HSA IRA. Potential taxable investment events like selling part of your taxable portfolio. Roth IRA conversions etc..
hm8un2k,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,1,Would that mean maxing out the 401k/403B with no match?   I feel like putting everything into those accounts pulls away from our short term goals. I feel kind of uncomfortable having a majorly of my investments in retirement accounts that I can’t touch until I’m 59.5. I think what if my husband and I want just stop working at 39 and 43 but then can’t lol not sure how people divvy those investments up if they retire so young!
hm9pusd,achieve_my_goals,11/27/2021,1,>You need to move out or get a room mate.  Thats if OP has a place large enough for roommates.
hmb4nny,xhoi,11/27/2021,1,You arent too late at all. Start reading up on Bogleheads check out Investopedia and learn about the tax advantaged options available to you (401k IRA HSA) as well as the various platforms for those accounts and normal taxable brokerage accounts.   Check out the PF wiki for some other advice and learn to look at ETFs and mutual funds instead of just picking individual stocks. Individual stocks can be fun but its really just gambling at that point.
hmc3x31,SLOKnightfall,11/27/2021,1,Definitely second negotiating the offer that you got.  They are interested in hiring you and will mostly likely have addition funds for the offer if you at least try and make a case for an increase.  I just recently got a new job and while the initial offer was good I countered with an 15% bump which I knew was a bit on the high end fully expecting them to come back with a lower value. After some back and forth I ended up with an additional 8k added just for asking for it.
hmckvka,sean_wuz_here,11/27/2021,1,No. Maine is not a community property state so the bank will not have to consider her mortgage. However if it were you would likely have to file a form that states she has no right to the property you are purchasing.
hmc5rt3,gines2634,11/27/2021,1,It’s possible he doesn’t remember spending the money. It’s hard to prove this unless you see his account transactions. It doesn’t add up. Unfortunately addicts aren’t the most reliable source of information.
hmcjy2k,gringgo,11/27/2021,1,Planet Fitness will do just fine. Its not just a cardio gym as Ive seen written here. Regular consistent gym attendance and working out are the keys. If you arent interested in bodybuilding then any $10 gym will give your what you put into it.
hmbv4w5,veloharris,11/27/2021,1,Take the offer from your boss but continue to seek other opportunities. You can definitely find a good marketing job in todays market.
hmbe246,ronald_mcdonald_4prz,11/27/2021,1,That’s what I was thinking. Saw some other post who said they would be taxed on more. Which I don’t agree with

hmbzi0y,KReddit934,11/27/2021,1,Thats a thought though Ive got 4 cards already. Can I juggle one more?   Hmmm.
hmbqdc7,iKilledBrandon,11/27/2021,1,Agreed. I was switched over from Simple then to BBVA this year and finally over to PNC. Just due to both banks being absorbed by PNC and I must say their app/website are the biggest pieces of shit Ive ever had to use.  Im not even going to rant about all the problems Ill just focus on the main one...I OFTEN TIMES AM NOT SURE OF HOW MUCH MONEY IS EVEN IN MY ACCOUNT DUE TO THE WEBSITE BUGGING OUT OR IT JUST LISTING AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THATS TOTALLY INCORRECT. Sometimes it shows me having more money than I should so I have to be careful others it shows me as having much less than I should so I have to be even more careful. Never had this issue with BoFA Chase or Simple. They were always clear about charges/pending charges and I never had to bust out a calculator trying to figure out how much spending money I have.
hmcpbur,CSimpson1162,11/27/2021,1,Yeah but dont do that this Monday

hma35n2,RobinKennedy23,11/27/2021,1,Check out r/creditcards  It depends on what type of business spend you are doing. Is there a lot of spend on traveling? Hotels? Or shipping and advertising? Do you make a lot of large purchases ($5000+ transactions).
hmc3oc3,mycoolaccount,11/27/2021,1,Thats surprising to me.    Ive worked for multiple gigantic companies and all of them have it very explicitly codified about how they lower your pay if you go down in position(and thus pay bands)

hmculdx,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1,Yes most banks only report your statement balance to your credit reports once a month. Keep it paid down and around 12/19 they will generate a new statement report the new balance and your score should go back up.

hmc1qbp,LooseMoose-1,11/27/2021,1,DON’T CONTRIBUTE TO 401k — contribute to Roth IRA instead.   I’d personally get your Roth IRA to the annual maximum of ~$6000 before contributing to the 401k. The benefit is this can serve as an emergency fund if you need it (withdrawals of contributions are tax and penalty free) but also serve as retirement if you don’t need it.   I’m 27 and #1 financial regret is over-contributing to my 401k. Now i don’t comfortably have the downpayment for a house in accounts outside of the 401k.
hmc8hn0,DeFuniak1895,11/27/2021,1,If you are not already writing out your monthly budget  start there.  Allocate a reasonable (to you) amount of money that you spend on self care ( clothes skin care and whatever you decide fits this category) . Every month ( or paycheck) you have X amount that you spend on items in that self care category.   I kinda had to start doing something like this after years of struggling financially.  I got to the point where my shoes were falling apart but I felt like I couldnt afford new shoes.  I was working lots of hours making more money than I ever had before and still eating a poverty starvation diet.   You have to take care of yourself.  You deserve it.  Its hard I know.
hmd8ikw,Psychological-Cow-21,11/27/2021,1,Yikes thats very unfortunate. Thats what I dont want to happen to me.
hmc8q7t,tony_boxacannoli,11/27/2021,1,depends on the gym.  at pf ...fir $10...you get?...weights...tons of cardio equip...smith machine...etc.  at the $30 gym....same stuff?  either offer a trainer?...cost there?
hmc577d,nutoreddit,11/27/2021,1,Thanks. I am just blindly dumping into SWPPX and got worried suddenly because of all the VTSAX conversation here.
hmc86yf,chunkycornbread,11/27/2021,1,Something else to consider is that you don’t want to be “house poor”. Just because you can afford something doesn’t mean you should. I was approved for a $300000 house for my first home. I would have been an idiot to purchase a house for that much. I wouldn’t have been able to do anything other than pay bills.
hmc2mg3,its_a_metaphor_morty,11/27/2021,1,Whats the best methodology to do this? Also did you downvote my preference to be debt free? Thats weird.
hmbhiz6,veloharris,11/27/2021,1,They can be part of it. If youre starting paying into a 401k and/or IRA youre definitely not too late. Invest in a target date fund and youll be set.

hmd1da7,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,Correct but OP also dont say its in a taxable account. So you cant say that they will owe taxes on the capital gains either.  /u/FN2187_JEDI is correct that there wouldnt be taxes if its sold within a retirement account.
hmcqzz8,DeluxeXL,11/27/2021,1,Yea that person is called a co-signer.
hm9aen1,ExpensiveCategory854,11/27/2021,1,I was in your boat I neglected to get any free money into my TSP.  I also wasn’t going to stay in the military yet ended up putting in 21 yrs retired and looked back at 9 of those years lost.  The amount of money lost is significant.    Even if you chose to leave you’re leaving money and growth on the table if/when you get out you can always roll it all into one.

hmbiqaz,Wahoo2K8,11/27/2021,1,Insurance won’t pay for fees while their investing still is ongoing.  OP has the responsibility to mitigate damages and excessive tow fees can absolutely be deducted from the settlement amount.  And finally if they don’t accept liability OP will be responsible for fees anyway so of course he or she has the incentive to minimize fees.
hmbm27z,Stoic_Chief,11/27/2021,1,Yeah pretty much what I was thinking - was just hoping there was some other angle I wasnt aware of.   Ill call them on Monday and see if I can negotiate. Ive been looking for new places all day today and Ive found some apartments that are comparable to where I am now (some even better) and that are closer to the rent I use to pay. Moving is just a hassle lol but Im prepared to do so.   And yeah I know owning is the way to go. This is actually my first apartment (only been here a year) - my goal was to maybe rent for 2-3 years and would have hopefully saved enough for a down payment on a Condo/ Townhouse. This is why I really dont want to pay too much rent.
hm9tomh,batwing71,11/27/2021,1,Back in ‘08 my 401k balance was about 60k. Through the crisis of ‘09 it dropped down to near 25k. I was concerned. I started thinking about my ‘drop dead number.’ For me I decided at 15k I would sell and buy into the cash investment. It started going up at around 24k. Through the whole drop I continued contributions and even raised it a bit. By 2012 I had near 180k. TLDR stay the course for the long term increase contributions if you can. When stocks drop your current investments/contributions can buy more.
hma14e6,WolverineTherapy,11/27/2021,1,Think of a mortgage like a necessary evil.  You have minimum payments sure.  You want to own the house outright as soon as possible though.  Its easier to pay off $250k than $280k.  If your payment is $1500 per month you should pay extra toward principal each month to own the house faster. Lower minimum payment leaves more cash for extra principal payments.  You also want to avoid keeping up with the Joness.  Who cares if the Joness hae quartz countertops and a sub zero freezer?  Do *you* want those things for *you*?  I would also caution you against buying a house with somebody not your spouse or business partner (in an LLC).
hmc6sjl,bigbaltic,11/27/2021,1,Ah. Well then that depends on what you wanna do. If you just wanna do cardio go to planet fitness. If you want to do free weight exercises then you should go somewhere else
hmbtslv,6BigAl9,11/27/2021,1,Definitely do not sell your car in that case. Im comfortable fixing cars in my driveway (no garage) and I would not trust a $3k car that I had to rely on considering what $3k gets you in this market.

hmd3hjm,Key-Emu5781,11/27/2021,1,Hi yes! I max this out but I read that it’s generally best to pay out of pocket if you can and keep the money in the HSA so it can grow tax free and use it later on (down payment on house?) Any thoughts?

hmbzl2c,Default87,11/27/2021,1,I would instead look up the concept of a 3 fund portfolio.  then it depends on where this money is.  if this money is in a tax advantaged account (like an IRA 401k HSA etc) then just sell and rebuy your new portfolio.  there is no tax implications of that.  if this money is in a taxable brokerage account then it depends on how much money we are talking about.  if this is only $10k then any tax implications of selling and rebuying will be minimal so its likely a good idea to just rip the bandaid off and fix it.  if you are talking about $100k+ then your tax implications are likely significant so I would at least make sure new contributions are going towards a better portfolio balance and then look for strategic opportunities to sell these old holdings to minimize taxes and work to get your portfolio turned around.
hmcbvtu,IndianaNetworkAdmin,11/27/2021,1,My resume is always online. Employers that are worth working with should not have any problem with resumes being kept up to date and online because they should trust that they are offering you something decent.  Its not really a sticky situation. Its your employer suddenly realizing that youre not going to stick around much longer. Theyre going to drop you once they have some other person they can shove into the position.  The course training thing sounds great except it would eat into what already sounds like limited spare time and Im sure it would connect with some kind of guilt We cant give you a raise but we paid for you to get more educated or Youre leaving us but we just paid for you to go to a class while you train yourself out of a job.  Disclaimer: I am a pessimist. I assume the worst from everyone.

hmd4l3a,Temporary-Ad-1531,11/27/2021,1,Ive seen this go way sideways many times with a bait and switch. In my state if you buy before marriage its separate property and doesnt become joint until the person that bought voluntarily adds their spouse to title after marriage. Ive seen several times where person before marriage and tells future spouse Ill add you when we get married then when they get married they bait and switch and refuse to add them
hm9u7cy,txholdup,11/27/2021,1,Please stop thinking of 401k IRA 457b as retirement accounts and instead think of them as tax sheltered wealth building accounts.  See problem solved you can never put too much into wealth building accounts.  And your Roth IRA especially isnt limited to retirement.  You can pull out your contributions when you are 40 or 32 but in the meantime all of your earnings grow tax free.   And dont forget your taxable stock/mutual fund account.  They will be your godsend if you decide to quit work early.
hmceksd,vettewiz,11/27/2021,1,I would contact your title attorney. They are the ones who validate things are cleared and paid.

hmbgu63,CQME,11/27/2021,1,> I sincerely hope that I can turn my investment to double  All I can say is caveat emptor.  Standard advice is to not put things youll need in the short-to-medium term in the stock market.  Yes in the long term stocks outperform just about anything else but short to medium term anything can happen and I mean anything.  Good luck =)
hmaefb2,raznog,11/27/2021,1,Yeah I have a few banks. USAA was the first I could deposit checks with phone. Now they pretty much all have it. Though I have to say last few years USAA has really gone the wrong way. Their support is not nearly as good as it used to be their services are subpar and very expensive. It used to be amazing but I’ve started dropping them because they aren’t nearly as good as they used to be.

hmcj8e6,pokeybill,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the info this is a good summation of some of the concerns Ive voiced over living in a rural area I grew up in a mixture of rural and city areas and know I dont have the extra time in my work schedule to maintain the property (we would likely wind up needing to pay someone to do at least some of the maintenance).  Im thinking of looking for something right on the edge of town with access to city utilities (especially sewer).
hmbpqle,brandonmadeit,11/27/2021,1,Just put it in a “high” interest yielding savings account and use discipline. It’s called an emergency fund because it’s for EMERGENCIES!
hm9lvsy,Danny0Shea,11/27/2021,3,OP being anxious about a big decision like this is totally normal even in your financial position. Youve done everything right and are prepared to buy a house but you need to get comfortable with the decision.  Ill just add quickly that dont feel like you need to buy youre at an age where flexibility is valuable. Opportunity at work in another city? Woman of your dreams lives in another state? If you can keep the cost of renting below your interest expense property tax insurance HOA fees and annual repairs and maintenance then renting can be a great deal.  If you buy keep all those expenses in mind in addition to the mortgage principal. Put as little down as you need to make your monthly budget comfortable. Your cash is better used in an emergency fund and invested rather than essentially earning your mortgage rate in the house.  If everything somehow goes wrong for a long period of time your worst case is living with your parents again. But for most Americans over a long period of time buying a house has been a net positive to their finances.
hmadpnp,digitalhelix84,11/27/2021,1,The money is physically moved a few times daily but the largest banks all operate pretty seamlessly and most people can easily transfer instantly.  Faster Payments and Osko are effectively the same as Zelle with the same solutions for smaller institutions.  The US also has several alternatives like Venmo or PayPal which can use the card payment networks for instant transfer.  Some people prefer the anonymity of that since you can set up an email just for your PayPal and Venmo rather than giving strangers your phone number or other similar identifying info.
hmams0t,420throwawayacc,11/27/2021,1,Do you have the ability to do gig work? If so do a few hours of gig work each week and put those towards the private loan. Once the private loan is payed off put that minimum towards your student loans.   It sounds like you dont have access to anything like a HELOC or Home Equity Loan and taking more student or private loans will dig you deeper. In this case Id say get some gig work like doordash and pay it off quick with a snowball.
hmd0dj9,wookibus,11/27/2021,1,I have nyseg and they usually do estimates for a few months and then do an actual reading and charge/reimburse the difference.  You should call and see if they did a reading when they switched the account over to you.  I called to have them set up my account when I purchased my home and I believe they did a reading shortly after.  &#x200B  I believe the estimates are also based off of the previous years bill so you might be using more gas and electricity than the previous owner.  There was also a gas leak for a week so that most likely gave a good increase to the usage.

hmcl7ia,daaamber,11/27/2021,1,My mom was trapped in a marriage that made her miserable. She was a SAHM with no more than a high school degree and only fast food or maid jobs under her belt. My dad also controlled what she could spend. So often had clothing in poor condition because it was not in the budget for her to buy new clothes -we got new clothing.  She made it very clear to me that I needed to have my own career and financial stability so I’d never be trapped. Its also good to have your own account so no one can control your spending.   Joint account should be for joint expenses or joint decisions only (home car food vacations). If you both have an income the remainder is up to you.

hmcbrdm,68_Bullitt,11/27/2021,1,Many of these funds are duplicating holdings. You could do a simple 2 fund portfolio and accomplish what you want.  For example Im with Vanguard. Im 70/30 VTSAX/VGT. That allows me to capture the entire US Market with a portion dedicated towards Technology. This makes me technology heavy but thats my personal preference.
hma8tjo,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,> Does anyone have an opinion on ESG funds as part of a portfolio of index funds?  The top companies in ESGV Vanguards ESG fund include shit companies like Amazon Facebook Google United Healthcare Comcast PayPal Bank of America McDonalds and AT&T just to name a few.  If ESG funds are supposed to invest in ethical socially conscious companies then theyre picking the wrong companies to invest in.  ESGs exist so people who dont actually look into the underlying investments can feel warm and fuzzy about their choices but theyre still investing in the same garbage companies that everyone hates.  Thats why I stick with total market index funds. I know most of my investments are in some truly terrible companies whose disappearance would make the world a better place. But investing in them is a necessary evil and I get the added diversification of the whole market.
hma79zv,FindFIREsomeday,11/27/2021,1,Thats also after your AGI (adjusted gross income) so that means take your gross pay and subtract your reg 401k contributions AND also subtract HSA contributions if you have one AND anything you pay for your health insurance premium.  Then subtract your standard deduction.  So if you make $90k and spend $200/mo on your Healthcare plan and save $800/ mo to your 401k then your taxable income is only $78k.  Then if youre single your standard deduction is $12550 (real number for 2021).  So your AGI or taxable income is $65450.  Now Im going to make pretend tax brackets:  Under $60k is 10% above $60k is 30%.  So youd be taxed: $6000 on the first $60k and  30% * $5450 = $1635 So your total taxes in my pretend tax system are: $6000+$1635= $7635  No where close to the $19k youd owe if every penny was taxed at 30%.
hmc7gz6,rroobbyynn,11/27/2021,1,My husband and I pay more in taxes while married. I make less than him and he makes about 1.5x as me. So I fall into a lower bracket he falls into a higher one and together we fall into the higher one.

hma91nk,Calm_Tomato,11/27/2021,1,You’re 24. What matters most when planning for retirement is the amount of time that money you invest has to grow. Put in at least the 6% have an emergency fund then pay off that debt fast. Once your debt is paid off put in as much as you possibly can for retirement. And do the Roth. You’re young and taxes are low.
hmc2x4n,LightSkinAdonis,11/27/2021,1,Probably not. I was paying more than that when I was younger and I only had a V6 Mustang. That being said my step father or as I like to call him my mom’s long term boyfriend was overcharging me for car insurance for years before I found out about it. I had no idea because I couldn’t get the car in my own name with no credit so I had my mother co-sign for me and he handled all the bills.  Moral of my little story is sometimes you can’t even trust people in your own immediate family.

hmabv5q,donniePump39,11/27/2021,1,Good point. Both DGRO and SCHD contain mostly bluechip stocks in top holdings which are already included in VTI to begin with. I was thinking extra income producing holdings may be better in case of bull markets where id reinvest the dividends and be better positioned on the next uptick
hmcxjku,Neither_Volume_1154,11/27/2021,1,Ok cool thats good!  I have a few months to figure this out but that makes me feel slightly better.
hmbb1ip,CPLeet,11/27/2021,1,1st off.. that 8% 401k match is great Pay!  Pay off the mortgage with the higher interest first. Sell the home at the higher marked up cost of how much are nowadays.  Then you can pay off your home and pocket the rest.   Work for about 2-3 more years to just save up and invest. Then retire before you turn 55.   The time you get in retirement is limited. Life is so short and you should spend as little of it as you can working. And as much as you can traveling vacationing or just sitting back taking daily naps.
hmcimut,IamLeven,11/27/2021,1,Yes 0 and high six figures is a large disparity
hmazqu2,cownan,11/27/2021,1,Ive even had trouble getting a cashiers check. Also for a car purchase negotiated the deal and the trade in on my previous car. I had transferred $30k from my investment account to my checking account a month previous. After everything I needed a cashiers check for ~24k. When I went to my local branch they kept me waiting for 45 mins while they called various people. They needed a signature at a certain level for the check I ended up needing to leave and come back the next day. It was a hassle and this was at Wells Fargo (not a little local bank)

hmbjwls,Anonymoose2021,11/27/2021,1,The tax implications of ISOs and NQs are very different.   This often leads people to exercise and hold ISO but to do an immediate exercise and sell of NQ options.   The NQ option gain from strike price to market price will be treated like W2 income.   The strike to market difference when exercising an ISO is AMT income but not ordinary income.   There is an AMT exemption amount so you should be exercising ISOs to just below the point where you owe AMT.  Co-workers particularly your boss (since he knows your option grant sizes) are generally a good place to start with your questions.   They may also have recommend stations for CPAs or CFPs that can help you plan the best way to handle the exercise of these options.

hm9kup1,Morepaperplease,11/27/2021,1,Illinois is the state she lives in.  I called the police because I didn’t know who to call.  They put her in a mental health facility but she had been in a hospital before. You need social services and express that this person is not capable of taking care of themselves.  They will ask if you want to be responsible and I declined- as difficult a decision as that is. But seeing her washed and not living on a urine soaked couch and not eating or going outside - it’s better now. She can go outside every day she goes to eat with people with prepared healthy food they do the laundry and give her medical care when needed. They took all her assets but who cares when the basics aren’t there- I didn’t need her to have her house- she needed help.  I let all the money 14k her car and her house which was a giant disaster and behind on mortgage and taxes anyway.  She is better off. And she’s okay.  Edit. She was in a mental facility until they could find a spot in the nursing home -4 weeks.  FYI. That’s just a place that they use to assess to sort this out then to the best place for their abilities is used. They did consider assisted living apartment but the self care just wasn’t there.

hmajsj6,3rdIQ,11/27/2021,1,Did you mean to ask Which fund?    There are thousands upon thousands of mutual funds and hundreds of brokerage companies that sell mutual funds. A mutual fund is not a silver bullet they are only one option investors have to choose from and their share price goes up and down with the market.  Investors have to have a comfort zone so they dont worry about their investments so they need to choose funds stocks ETFs etc very carefully to balance risk and safety because even good fund managers can have a bad year or the economy goes south or like we saw today a new COVID outbreak caused a dip in the market. But to answer your question here are three funds that have similar objectives and returns. They all have the same big tech companies making up 40% to 50% of their holdings.   APGYX  TRBCX  FBGRX
hmbf42v,CQME,11/27/2021,1,>I have 3k in debts at a 5% interest and 4k in emergency funds with 55k in stocks which I want to leave as a long position but I could pull them out on a 3 day notice for extra emergency funds.  It sounds like youre aware that a prudent thing to do would be to further pad your emergency fund a bit so that you wont have to sell stocks in an emergency.  If an emergency like say job loss occurred concomitantly with a recession (happens all the time) your stocks will get pummeled and youll have to sell precisely when you want to be buying.  >I think the problem with this is we are basically paying out 39% of our income to pay for our current place with both of us working 44 hours a week. Ideally I want that to be closer to 30%.  Yes good.  >So if I got a condo for 240k. Sold 40k stock as a down payment and then our payments would be 1100 a month before insurance and utilities.  Youre going to need a (much) bigger cash cushion.  If you get a condo youll probably have HOA fees on top of taxes and insurance.  This will probably make your condo purchase significantly less affordable on a monthly basis than what you are doing now.  Youre also going to have to set aside optimally $15-20k for unexpected maintenance issues...after all its your condo you have to fix it.  IMHO I dont think youre ready for this yet you need more planning and ideally more cash.  You can instead pay a lot less down and hold onto that extra cash for these contingencies just be aware that your monthly expenses are likely going to go up not down if you make your planned purchase.  >Would planning on doing something like this in 24 to 36 months be a bad idea? Hoping by then Im making 15% more and her too. Im not sure if hone ownership is feasible for a couple making 90k in annual before taxes in this market.  This sounds feasible especially if both of you work towards saving up cash for this purchase.  You may also want to consider getting out of the stock market now if you are going to rely upon those funds for your down payment in order to decrease risk and volatility.  >What things do I need to think about financially for the next few years getting married etc?  This is a much bigger question lol...depends upon what yall want to do after getting married.  =)

If i still work Ill contribute up to the match and invest rest of the money in individual investment account
hmcvapd,colterlovette,11/27/2021,1,If this is a thing it’s certainly not in violation to the constructs I’ve explained. Perhaps it’s some unique state reg or similar but in those cases the banks involved with the sale wouldn’t allow for that kind of risk to the note holder there will be some kind of insurance against the risk of undisclosed or unknown financial exposures like this specific to this state(s) regulatory atmosphere.   I’ve seen stranger things but I can’t fathom how a contract with one party could become the responsibility of another party without some kind of agreement from the new party (blind or not and in the sale of a large asset there are many well informed players).   In either case there’s more complexity here that is disconnected from the needs of this post and in the end it’s still not the asset that holds the account.

hmaptdg,AlphaCurrency,11/27/2021,1,Being on the mortgage doesnt matter. That just liability for the loan. You need yo be on the DEED to the house to have partial ownership.

hmaxgm4,wanna_be_doc,11/27/2021,1,Download an app like Mint or You Need A Budget.   The first goal of budgeting is figuring out exactly where your money is going.  These apps can help you track your expenses on your credit cards so you’ll see exactly how much you’re spending on various categories.  If you’re spending a thousand dollars eating out each month then you know what to cut.  If it’s clothes then it’s that.   Find where your money is going each month and then work on cutting back your major line items.
hmd6dvt,kaiserbun,11/27/2021,1,Just a thought. You might want to check with the local municipality to make sure there are no open permits. Youre not supposed to be able to close on a property with open permits but it happens.

hma94yx,MathandMarketsCFA,11/27/2021,1,>Overweighting dividends (especially when young) isn’t the best strategy since you’re giving up on growth when you ostensibly have a very long time horizon.  This isnt true under the assumptions of an efficient market. The expected return of any name you own assuming equal levels of systematic risk should return the same amount: dividend yield + expected capital gains. If this werent the case and a name was expected to return more via capital gains + dividend yield then the price would rise until the levels of expected return are equal.   The key difference not yet mentioned is the differing tax regimes for dividends and capital gains.  In a regime where dividends are taxed more favorably youd hold a higher percentage of dividend yielding firms than otherwise and vice versa.  This all gets a bit more complex when you take into consideration individuals have different risk aversion coefficients than the market as a whole but most do not get so into the weeds.

For example if youre what would be considered a homebody spending more on a space that makes you more comfortable outside of work could be a good thing overall. If you value traveling and going out to eat / drink a lot it would not be.  Ultimately this is a decision only you can truly make.

hma0wyt,PR2NP,11/27/2021,1,You have to consider that when you buy a house you’re not just paying rent. You are now paying for all utilities if you weren’t before all maintenance and repairs taxes etc. I’d probably buy a place that is closer to what your rent was and save/invest that extra money. If in a couple years you find you can easily afford to upgrade consider selling the house and upgrading if the house property value hasn’t fallen.

hmd6eyz,not-now-im-redditing,11/27/2021,1,ICompound growth applies to stocks. Compound interest generally does not.   Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) simplifies the growth of an asset that has increased in value over many years to an annual rate of return. That rate of return is the equivalent of compound interest earned each year. For example the stock market has an inflation adjusted historical CAGR between 6-7%. People therefore that invest in a broadly diversified US index fund will often use 6-7% as the growth rate to determine the value of their investment at retirement.   CAGR can also be used to compare results of various investments but there are limitations and assumptions usually in the data being used so YMMV. But in general any asset that goes up in value has a rate of return. The investor may not being paid interest but they are receiving value.
hmbmfol,AGrainOfSalt435,11/27/2021,1,>I was shocked how much went to taxes instead of the Roth. I stopped doing that.  Roth is great! Assuming your future income is going to be in a higher tax bracket than it is now. Which is the case Im in. I dont mind at all paying the taxes now to get the money tax free later with tax free growth. Gonna be very sweet to take that out later and it not impact my future taxes. And my tax bracket now is pretty low compared to what it will be in a few years.  I will change to pre-tax contributions later once our salary increases to get those sweet tax savings.
hmau324,dleskov,11/27/2021,1,I would still argue that money on average can buy time. One can die prematurely in a car accident or otherwise but if they dont would not better quality of life and access to better medicine usually result in a longer lifespan? And money can certainly buy you free time.

hma230t,silkysilkk,11/27/2021,1,I wouldnt worry too much about that. Having worked for a Honda dealership for a while these things happen way more than you think.   One of two things happened. 1. Honda Financial services have all these metrics in place that automatically flags any potential risks. 9 out of ten times all the dealership needs to do is rehash the deal(finance manager calls Honda financial services) and this will be resolved in less than two minutes. Since you said you were current before getting this new vehicle the system did the initial diagnosis and pushed it through but the secondary check pulled up your missed payment and the system rescinded the approval. This is merely optics  2. The dealership did not push your deal through but assumed you would be approved based on your history with Honda. This is a very common practice. They probably got a conditional approval from either Honda or another bank and they took that and ran with it. Sometimes these banks would come back and request additional information or more documents. I doubt that is your situation since you have history with Honda.  I wouldnt stress. The worst that could happen is that they may bump you down form Tier one rate to the next level down which might make your payment go up about $20. Honda values loyalty so as long as you are current with them they will push you through. Goodluck and enjoy that new vehicle.

hmbgkb6,wanttostayhidden,11/27/2021,1,$19500 is the limit for the employees pretax and Roth contributions combined. There is another limit of $58000. The 58k limit includes the employee and employer contributions.
hmabko5,_c4rli3,11/27/2021,1,Thank you so much for this!
hmb2lec,Zootallurs,11/27/2021,1,Sell the current home and redeploy your capital to a proper investment property. The rent-to-value ratio is too far out of whack. You either won’t cash flow will have terrible Return on Equity or both. Bonus that your capital gains will be exempt if you sell now.
hmbx5uv,Anxious-Ad1868,11/27/2021,1,Where the hell are you in the SE that a starter home is 500k?  That is ridiculous.  I can not even imagine Atlanta is that crazy but I may be wrong.
hmbgnnz,cownan,11/27/2021,1,Thats good feedback thanks! Im not super anti-debt (at least as far as mortgages go) I do feel the market is overheated and due for a maybe substantial correction. I think thats the source of my stress. It does feel like real estate is a good hedge right now stashing cash in the mortgage is a good thought which would let me retain the tax benefits of holding the mortgage - and I could always get it back through a cash out refi if I needed it.
hmbnh2i,Valendorf,11/27/2021,1,My resume has been online since having resumes online became a thing.  I update it after every noteworthy change.  Keep looking.  If current job gets worse take pay cut and keep looking for better and leave when you get what you want.  As long as you don’t show this as a pattern aka a new job every 2 months for a solid year or two it won’t be an issue in the future.
hmbryow,El_Zoid0,11/27/2021,1,Not married but after watching in sickness and for worse with my own eyes theres a lot to think about especially in the post covid times not to mention how your lives will change after college.  My mother had to go through the court system for conservatorship for my dad after he fell ill and couldnt do shit for himself. We were turning him every two hours and feeding him through a G-tube replacing his condom catheter deep suctioning his tracheostomy. For 3.5 years until he died. This shit is marriage too. You gotta talk about what happens if you get COVID or in a car accident all that then put it on paper have witnesses so there arent fights when someones in the hospital or over property when the worst happens. If you do end up marrying get conservatorship and your advanced directives in order.  If you guys are in decent majors and can be gainfully employed soon after accumulate wealth pay off college debts then think about a wedding. Just because you love him doesnt mean you need to let your guard down. My mother always emphasized being stable alone was the pathway to independence. You guys will be stronger together overall and alleviate stress in your relationship if both of you are better off financially independently.  Theres no reason you cant play house before getting married either. Youll still learn how to live with each other outside the drama and confines of college life all while saving on rent and planning that wedding.   So what are you rushing for? A marriage or a party?   Also you can keep wedding costs down by doing a courthouse wedding or having a personal friend who is licensed to marry you. Skip the church location and have both ceremony and reception at the same spot. Just go into it knowing you might be upcharged for a venue if the word wedding comes up.  If you need a personal rec for a high end photographer lmk but if you want nice professional photos hire someone thats not your friend/fam that has their own website. If you wanna cut on expenses in photography you can look to find someone who will do only digital and will send you all the raw images for you so do what you wish. Make sure you find someone that goes over the ultimate shot checklist.    Remember its a party so get creative and savvy wherever you can.
hmb43aa,theEucalyptus,11/27/2021,1,The 2021 limit for 401k contributions is $19.5k that is inclusive for both pre- and post-tax accounts. Because youve already reached the 2021 limit with you previous employer you arent eligible to contribute any more this year.
hmcf2fc,yellowcanvas,11/27/2021,1,I’m recovering from an injury right now but i used to do a lot of deadlifts and hip thrusts when I was working out.  Edit: context from another comment: I had a nice home gym setup where I had a treadmill a combination machine for upper body and a barbell and bumper plates going up to 240lbs.
hmagjlg,TK_TK_,11/27/2021,1,You should have her info as well and make sure that you are on your way to 1x your combined income by 30.   That income will almost certainly be higher by then so some of every raise should go to retirement until you reach a 15% contribution level. Some people count company match toward that % and some don’t I’ve seen.   Also because I know more than one person who made this mistake 5% from you and 4% from her doesn’t mean you’re contributing 9%. (I know it’s really obvious but I just have to throw it out there.)   I started with 6% at age 24 and just upped the contributions with every raise and promotion and am now in the position of retiring early if I want to. So it’s definitely doable to save more than adequately without even feeling it—but do pay attention to it over time. Be sure to get your partner’s info and get on the same page (also see whether either of you has access to an HSA?) but it sounds like you’re off to a good start.  I wouldn’t add more to taxable accounts until you’re maxing all your tax-advantaged space. Remember that you can access your Roth contributions (not growth) without a penalty if you ever need to so you don’t have to worry that all your money is locked away until retirement age—I know that’s a common concern when retirement is decades away.
hm90sfg,TuesdayGamby,11/27/2021,1,Refi for the lowest rate you can. Be wary of the cash out the money spends easy and paying it back is not. I know people that tap their equity every few years to spend and after doing that for 30+ years have a house that still has a 30 year mortgage  You can always get a HELOC if you want cash.
hmbzql2,dequeued,11/27/2021,1,SWPPX is a good fund with a super low expense ratio.  I think the only significant difference is that most Vanguard **mutual funds** are more tax-efficient because of their unique fund structure (this only applies to Vanguard mutual funds that have also have an ETF share class). This only matters for taxable accounts though. (Of course if you already hold SWPPX in a taxable account and it has already increased in value I wouldnt recommend switching those shares to anything else because capital gains are generally something you want to defer as long as possible and that matters more than a minor difference in tax efficiency.)  Beyond that:  - I have a slight preference for US total stock market funds over S&P 500 funds because they also include small cap stocks but the historical rate of return is basically the same.  - I also have a slight preference for Vanguard index funds because they tend to be *ever-so-slightly* better funds on average compared to similar funds from Schwab Fidelity iShares etc. on measures such as number of holdings tracking error cash percentages (lower is better in stock market funds) etc. Nowadays the difference is so small that it barely matters though.  - Edit: Youre asking about a Schwab fund but just to cover the bases: The Fidelity ZERO funds have an additional strike against them for taxable accounts because they cannot be transferred outside of Fidelity (unlike most other mutual funds and unlike all ETFs).
hmcngx9,ElderberryLoud5990,11/27/2021,1,An attorney seems appropriate. Thank you!
hmab9kp,ErikRogers,11/27/2021,1,I think theres a couple of things at work here...bear in mind  Im not an american and have only visited a handful of times.  Some companies especially among lower paying companies push employees towards receiving pay via some kind of cash card. It must be cheaper for the employer than doing direct payroll deposit. These cards arent *quite* bank accounts but likely work for most of the employees needs (can use it at the store or an ATM). Transfering money from one of these cards to your bank account is possible but the cash card company charges a fee for that...and its not instantaneous..  Heres the part where Im really speculating: at a Walmart Money Services counter you can get a cheque/money order to send your landlord and pay for it using a card. Is it cheaper than transferring to a bank account and writing your own cheque? No...but its faster and your rent is due and you didnt have enough on hand until payday.  Also if the cash card is good for 95% of your needs and it costs money to transfer to a bank and many chequing accounts are not no-fee you begin to wonder why bother with a chequing account?
hmb7v1u,mrisuckwithmoney,11/27/2021,1,I know nothing about cars so I agree with you
hmcosat,1nd3x,11/27/2021,1,ehh....depends....yes it may cost me money to learn of a termite infestation and fix it myself...  but if I just wait...my emergency fund only needs to cover the cost of my insurance deductible when my house actually falls apart.  edit this isnt to say you shouldnt have if i lose my job for an extended period of time emergency fund...thats different...
hmcn1dp,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,>	Ultimately I want a news platform that will inform me of upcoming stocks mutual funds ETFs and index funds to invest in in hopes to make a lot of money later down the road.  That’s not a thing.  No one knows and if they say they do they’re selling something.   Buy the market.
hmcklty,SubaWho1337,11/27/2021,1,Hey buddy my first suggestion is start watching a few people on youtube. They can kind of get you started. I would suggest taking the information and then doing your own research to make sure its sound because it will include opinions and potential beneficial directions for them in there. Andrei Jikh is a great channel and so is Graham Stephen. They are pretty down to earth and fact based and relatively unbiased. usually the standard ideas are 401K from employer or roth 401k = to what the company matches because it is free money. Beyond that next steps are build an emergency fund = 6 to 12 months of your monthly expenses as savings in case anything bad happens. And finally max out a Roth IRA. This info should give you a good starting point :). Best of luck!
hmc1c23,The0Walrus,11/27/2021,1,I own the house I live in. No mortgage.
hmaxgmr,invenio78,11/27/2021,1,There can be some financial risk.  For example if your spouse is sued they may now have access to their combined wealth and assets.  But overall getting married should not be a significant financial burden or benefit (presuming you dont go into debt to pay for some lavish wedding or something of that nature).
hmbbwc3,ShortHandz,11/27/2021,1,I would keep it for $25 bucks a year. You never know what the future will hold in store. Maybe it is worth $1000 now maybe its worth $100000 in 30 years. I would just keep it.
hma7tlj,Dilettantest,11/27/2021,1,Good news my partner says I erred.  Since the check was made payable to Provider B not to you you would not face penalties.   So I’m going to delete my earlier post.  But please track that down ASAP.
hmcfox8,PM_ME_GLUTE_SPREAD,11/27/2021,1,It might be worth making a call to the public service commission. I’m not sure if they have any power here but in my area when there’s an issue with water service PSC’s word is law and they don’t fuck around.   At the very least they should likely be required to give out the rates and verify that the meters they use are functioning properly.
hmat738,hopingtothrive,11/27/2021,1, >bank teller for 40 hours or less a week or some easier retail job.  Bank teller with limited English isnt going to happen.  Retail does not pay well and is rarely full-time. Usually sales associates do a certain amount of stocking and moving merchandise around. If she only getting 2 days off a month she must be getting overtime and shes not going to make that kind of money anywhere else.   Can she look for another pharmacy? That would be an easier transition than a new career.

hma9dpz,goldenmoca28,11/27/2021,1,Former chase employee here. They can get the date it was cashed and where it went. The branch employees need to call banker support and put in a research request. I did this all the time. It is entirely possible.
hmd9agg,BrianKill,11/27/2021,1,Honestly you are talking about $1/day.    I have no doubt you could panhandle that $1 on the way to the gym so it costs you nothing.    Youre young so I assume you like to go out for drinks with friends.   A glass of crappy wine or a cocktail made with house spirits is now $12.   A decent latte is $4/day.    If you think the guys in your free gym are creeps would you pay $1/day to not have to deal with them?   You are taking this to the absurd.
hmcokx3,iSOBigD,11/27/2021,1,You should always want that.  Theres no advantage to having to rely on someone or bringing no income to your household unless youre home with kids...which can also lead to problems if theres ever a breakup.  If youre not well off financially its probably best to save and invest that wedding money.
hmcc6dd,Xlotus,11/27/2021,1,That’s not always how it works though. I’m usually on board when we’re talking about massive companies who have massive year over year profits but OP is referring to a startup business and the pay doesn’t sound like the main issue anyway. My own business which is on the bottom end of a medium sized business is not really making much money but has a lot of potential. There is such a huge pay range for what our employees could make elsewhere (much less or much more depending on the business) but if I handed out raises to everyone who could possibly find another job for money elsewhere I would be personally broke within a few months and everyone working for me would ultimately lose their job. This is especially true for employees who fall into the overhead category as they aren’t directly contributing anything towards the break even number (though in many respects they are the most important to the company functioning on the day to day and growing).  Edit:This was supposed to be a reply to one of the commenters suggesting that a company should just pay more if they have a key employee instead of having a backup plan in place.
hmcclkt,nothlit,11/27/2021,1,It basically means the actual ratio of US to international stocks in the real world is about 60/40. So if you want your investments to mirror the real world thats the ratio youd probably want. Going with 70/30 means youre tilting toward US stocks i.e. overweighting domestic stocks out of proportion to their actual size.
hmbkqor,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,OP can you see your meter (or is it locked on your building)?  Turn everything off in your apartment and look at the meter. Is it still spinning like a carnival whirly-bird ride?
hmb3wm1,Cetun,11/27/2021,1,Get it from the tow yard presumably the cost of towing and the time in the tow yard is recoverable from your insurance. However with damages there is one caveat you have to do everything within your power to reduce the amount of damages. So if you have the power to get the car from the tow companys lot and you refuse to do so and it makes getting the car from the tow companys lot more expensive you may be responsible for that entire bill.   You have a duty to reduce damages the car in the lot is increasing damages get the car out of the lot send a bill to the insurance company.
hmagyju,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,Lets say in retirement you need $80k/yr net income.  If you use Roth only all of your contributions now are taxed at 12% (because your marginal bracket is 12%). In retirement you take out $80k - its all untaxed which is great because you effectively already paid 12% on the entire thing. Which means you paid $9600 in tax to get a net income of $80000 = 12% effective tax (9600 / 80000).  If instead you use Traditional for the entire thing all your contributions now are taxed at 0%. In retirement you take out $87k because youre going to owe some tax. Your first $25900 is $0 in tax (standard deduction) your next $20550 is $2055 in tax (10%). Your next $40550 is $4866 in tax (12%). Your total tax paid = $6921 giving you a net income of $80079 = 7.955% effective tax (6921 / 87000).    So with a retirement income of $80k net if you paid into Roth only from the 12% bracket your total tax paid = 12%...if instead you paid into Traditional only and deferred tax your total tax paid = 7.955% for a similar net income.    As for why max out the Roth IRA at all now it gives you flexibility. If your retirement income is $150k later because you did really well the 12% you paid for the Roth will be better than paying 22% on the dollars in the 22% bracket. ($83k to $178k). It can also shelter you from higher taxes if tax laws change by the time you retire assuming they dont change Roth tax laws by then. Plus its pretty easy to hit the $6k limit and then put any additional back into traditional 401k anyway.    EDIT: Additionally with a Roth IRA you can take contributions out early without penalty so you could use that to help you retire earlier than 59.5 if you wanted to...which you cant do with traditional (you would pay tax *plus* a 10% penalty).
hmbce02,RedditVince,11/27/2021,1,Thats after OP shells out $4-5k to put the land in their name.
hmcswlr,CyberMatrix87,11/27/2021,1,Do spouses co-sign a house? For a car the co-signer is also on the registration. At least in the U.S. This puts them nowhere but the responsibility to pay. A mortgage also isn’t a primary/co-signer deal. I’m asking not telling.
hmc8i4s,UMfan11244,11/27/2021,1,So if she had $30k in transactions that doesn’t mean it’s $30k in profit. You need to find out her expenses.
hma9ojz,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,If you are not doing anything illegal you will be fine. The bank has to report these things so they can try to find the real bad guys. Nothing to worry about
hmbo7pa,MakeItHomemade,11/27/2021,1,Yep.   My dad just sold his income property because the management kept raising rates and they were making more off of it than him.   It is an easy rental .25 miles from a major university older home but everything updated in 2006 at time of purchase. They have painted freshened up over the years.
hma9eiu,Cjkust,11/27/2021,1,I think what you think and what is happening are two different things. You have a balance now which shows me you are not good with credit cards. I would focus on fixing that before you go down getting another card with rewards.  Just my opinion you do you.
hm8wve3,iliveonramen,11/27/2021,1,Your dad isn’t dumb at all. Having enough savings to last you through an emergency is smart. Paying off student loans is conservative but once again smart. Student loans are the one debt that can follow you to the grave.   He’s giving you conservative financial advice which isn’t wrong at all.
hmcu6ou,daviongray,11/27/2021,1,Because he wants to make a larger purchase than his credit limit? Ive seen people do this for car purchases to get the points.

hmanq1y,extrapolatorman,11/27/2021,1,I would keep it but if you really want to get rid of it quit paying the taxes on it and the County will put a lien on it and take it off your hands for free.
hmc1h49,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,>It does not matter. Utilization is not a building factor since it has no memory: it only cares about the last reported number from each account so you can usually manipulate that factor as desired in 5 weeks or less.   Just stay within budget and pay full statement balances before the cutoff time of the due date.  THIS \^\^\^\^.
hmbfksn,Wermys,11/27/2021,1,If they didnt cash it.  That means the check either was received and they lost it or they didnt receive it at all.  Claiming that it is already paid isnt going to fly here.  Bill pay really is just a check that is sent that is all.  It isnt PROOF that the payee received it.   Go to the bank ask them to pull the records see if it was cashed and then send proof or if not cash void the previous check and resend.    Not really much to it here.  Most people are reasonable as long as you can show proof of what happened.
hmcksz0,quelindolio,11/27/2021,1,Check out North Leander. They have a good school district. I believe you can find something relatively reasonable (for this area and time) toward liberty hill that will check most of your boxes.

hmb66di,ApatheticAbsurdist,11/27/2021,1,Being married doesnt cost more per se. Weddings cost a lot. Having a spouse that is bad at money costs a lot.  There are some savings to be had... cohabitating saves money. Depending on what you have for health insurance if one spouse has better health benefits at work that could lead to savings. There can be some tax benefits filing married but its not really as big as many people make out.  But if you have a very expensive wedding that can lead to a lot of debt. And if you mix your finances and the other partner is bad with money... their debt is your debt.  Cohabitate live together without mixing finances and see how it goes. Get to know the inner workings of the other person. Many marriages fail because of incompatible financial attitudes and living together will give you better insight into that. Hopefully everything is great and then you can tie the knot. But I will tell you one thing that is very expensive is divorce.  One other thing Ive learned about relationships (as Im at least twice your age) Ive been with my partner for more than half of your entire life span and it will sound weird but part of the reason we feel we last is that we both are capable of walking away from the relationship. Not that we want to but if we did we wouldnt be here. We know both of us are here because we want to be not because we need to be. If one person is I cant live without you (either emotionally financially or for whatever reason) the relationship becomes imbalanced and that isnt healthy. Having some financial stability to the point where if he wasnt there you could on some level support yourself (even if its painful) helps keep that balance in check.

hmc7wti,dswpro,11/27/2021,1,Speak to an accountant about a schedule C or other options  If she was buying and selling there may be an audit trail you have not thought of that can lead you to a reasonable estimate of the cost and profit in these items. Certainly she should keep accurate records going forward. Youd be surprised how many businesses start exactly this way. No reason for her to discontinue making money.
hmd3r7d,klekaelly,11/27/2021,1,I just paid $400 for a year at my local private gym. That comes out to be a little over 30$ a month.

hmawat8,Breakfasttimer,11/27/2021,1,I want to echo the others here and say that budgeting software can be very helpful in keeping track of your money.

hmd33mw,xantharia,11/27/2021,1,Being married with children is usually advantageous tax-wise. That assumes you’re not going to get divorced which is often incredibly expensive and cancels out any prior tax advantages.
hmb3718,Its-a-write-off,11/27/2021,1,Depreciation recapture is likely the biggest tax hot theyll take here so it matters. They have probably reduced their basis to just a million or so by now.  Any chance theyll be doing a 1031 exchange?  They pay capital gains on just the profit.  But they pay depreciation recapture on the difference between their basis and 3.5 million and that at their marginal tax rate. So probably 37% just for federal.
hma4tv1,plowt-kirn,11/27/2021,1,Employer contributions (match safe harbor profit sharing) are always Traditional period. Regardless of how you contribute.   Your 401(k) basically has two hidden sub accounts - one Traditional and one Roth.

hmao5j7,MasinMadasHell,11/27/2021,1,Your sister is not wrong but neither are you. Its two different perspectives. I didnt get married until 30 and by then I had been on my own and managed my money. We had a few hiccups with merging finances but were fine now. I have a friend who got married at 22 and they had years and years of adjusting and disagreeing about how to manage money. They are fine now however.   Keep talking to your boyfriend about money and how youll manage it together shared financial goals etc.
hm940nv,Chris55730,11/27/2021,1,Thanks! I didn’t know how that worked. I always fall well between the 54k and next bracket so never had to think about it until now
hmanyjw,420throwawayacc,11/27/2021,1,Home Equity Line of Credit. (You need to own a home to have access to something like this. The interest is typically much cheaper than other debt consolidation  ans its a long term so its an attractive option if you have lots if equity or debt.)  Gig work is good for filling in the gaps. Even if its an extra 50 euros its something you can put towards the debts.   Are you able to make both payments? Can you pay more towards them than the minimum?
hmae74v,sf_torquatus,11/27/2021,1,You dont want the purchase of a car to set you behind financially. Use whatever rule you prefer to estimate a reasonable auto cost (10 % rule etc).   You can get a decent car for new or near-new for the 19k-24k range. But if I were you Id buy $5k car of a reliable brand and keep it running for a few years. Even if it costs you $1k/yr in repairs you will still be ahead on the costs of a newer car. Save up for whatever car you want and try to outlast the price inflation.

hmcg1xi,PM_ME_GLUTE_SPREAD,11/27/2021,1,They’ll have treadmills likely other cardio machines like ellipticals various machines for strength training (think those hammer curl machines and tricep pushdown machines and the like) some dumbbells (I think they go up to 60 pounds which for most exercises are plenty adequate) and smith machines that can be used for more powerlifting type exercises though they aren’t recommended by most to be used for these purposes.   You can also likely go in and ask to just tour the facility to see what they offer. I’ve never been to a gym that wouldn’t let somebody walk through and check out to see what they have.

hmcscb6,VicMackeyLKN,11/27/2021,1,Open a Roth IRA if you’re fully contributing to employer 401ks
hm92ck1,WhatIsQuail,11/27/2021,1,Read the wiki. Are you missing a match by not investing in TSP? If so then you need to start contributing to get the match. You can always move out of the TSP if you EAS.  Other than that a Roth IRA might be a good call assuming your have low enlisted income. Youll have to judge for yourself on youre savings balance but if thats just an emergency fund then I imagine its pretty high considering you shouldnt have rent or many other expenses right now. You might think about using some of that to fund your IRAs.
hmd8su6,jhairehmyah,11/27/2021,1,There are a number of issues in medicine that aren’t life or death and can be a choice.  Just last month my Doctor recommended an MRI for my bulged disc. I refused. Because I’ve been working out and my new strength has made the pain less and what will an MRI tell me—that I’m SOL and have to live with it?  That said isn’t the purpose of insurance to help you cover costs AFTER something has gone wrong? AFTER your home gets hit by a tornado AFTER you hit the other car AFTER you lift the thing the wrong way and go on temporary disability? And all those cases have a deductible.   If your checkup (free) finds a skin cancer a heart murmur high blood pressure etc it’s done it’s job. It’s helped you identify an issue before it gets worse and more costly (and in heath fatal).  I hate the system as much as the next guy but let’s stop pretending that insurance doesn’t work this way: with deductibles.
hmb5ukl,kingbitchtits,11/27/2021,1,Who doesnt want or need land! This isnt financial advice but just pay your taxes and forget you have it until the phone starts ringing!

This question shows that you have room to learn more. I think Im earning around $8 per month on a $20k balance right now and thats in a so called high interest account. Your money is not growing in the bank.
hmcft1z,PetraLoseIt,11/27/2021,1,Are you now investing in low-fee broadly diversified index funds and/or ETFs? I hope so. They will probably do much better (over the long run dips are going to happen too).
hma91ty,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,We just paid off all of our credit card debt using a bonus my husband got from leaving his previous job in August. We were both credit card debt free in the beginning of October. So right now we only have our student loan debts since we dont have a mortgage under our name yet. Now were running small debts that we pay off immediately to build our credit. We are currently both above 700 because of it but the mortgage broker says he has to take the middle score I guess and mine is around a 660 or 670 because of some delinquency issues I fell into 5 years ago.
hmadk8d,fawningandconning,11/27/2021,1,Yeah it doesn’t factor in because it’s no longer consistent or guaranteed. If it is in the same industry some underwriters will go a bit easier on the 2 years length but as he’s already seen it’s not going to be easy.
hmcoqgt,Curious_Tony,11/27/2021,1,Not sure the interest rate off the top of my head but it’s about 70 extra dollars a month right now. No emergency funds but I would have 4-5k after paying it off. I make decent money and I own my home and my monthly bills are pretty low.

hmd2x3t,Jaynett,11/27/2021,1,For the future do you have access to an HSA plan? It allows you to put pre-tax money in an account to be used towards medical spending including your deductible. Its a GREAT deal - look up the tax benefits but you can invest what you dont spend and it grows tax free.
hm8vy4j,Frankwillie87,11/27/2021,4,Youre getting down voted but thats just how strongly people have been conditioned to view their bank statements as the correct way to do accounting.   Its really just designed to make the job easier on the bank tellers that have to deal with those customers.
hmabm8z,Thelton26,11/27/2021,1,Marriage like most anything else can be as expensive as you want it to be. And whether or not youre married you are both buying food paying rent and utilities etc. The wedding itself and the ring can be extremely expensive but youve already talked about that and want it to be reasonable.  As far as combining finances I personally think its a good idea. It keeps you on the same page and there wont be any debates about my money and your money or one of you paying for something. The money is both of yours and goes into a pool.

hmc1eop,terpischore761,11/27/2021,1,The 6K goes towards the 58k max.
hmcjc1x,Frozenlazer,11/27/2021,1,When you have a procedure done at a surgery center or hospital or other facility its not a package deal. Typically youll get billed by the facility (for providing the location and equipment and non physician staff) and then by each doctor that treated you. So for a regular surgery a bill from the surgeon and the anesthesiologist are expected. If you had any xrays or other imaging done  youll likely get a bill from a radiologist for reading your images and telling the other doctors what they see.  Also doctors etc do nothing to guarantee results.
hmbo5pu,jbchris3,11/27/2021,1,call the finance company  immediately.  the last thing they want to do is repossession. they want you to keep making payments. a similar situation  happened to me and I was able to work out a 2 month grace period. they just threw the missed payments to the end of the loan. I ended up paying  a little  more than I would have like die to the unpaid interest but I was able to keep the car. I also had to pay a $100 dollar  administration  fee bit it all worked out in the end
hmcpt8i,Fun_Personality1201,11/27/2021,1,Only on an FHA loan will they consider her debts. Even if she’s not on title or the loan. Conventional loans do not care.
hmcqrc8,nothlit,11/27/2021,1,Roth IRA? See error #1 here: https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/fix-backdoor-roth-ira-screw-ups/
hmbmos9,Adorable_Tour_2892,11/27/2021,1,Awesome thanks again for the advice. Nice to just have somebody to bounce your thoughts off of to ensure Im not crazy. Ill get the backdoor started before they take away the opportunity!
hmbsotj,leuno,11/27/2021,1,I wouldnt be so quick to assume youd be training your replacement. Companies want things to run smoothly and I think its on you to communicate that you being a one person department is not sufficient. If it just cant be done well that way they want to know that. Sure they also dont want to pay for 2 people if they dont have to but employee retention is almost always preferable to replacement. So if your boss has gotten the idea that thats whats going on and that this should really be a 2 person department then that is what they want. It just has to be proven to them.  So then the question becomes: what is your work like? Are they satisfied with it? Because then the issue is youre saying you need help but youre still getting youre work in on time and its good therefore you are wrong. But if the work is suffering along with you then whats best for them is to actually have 2 people doing a good job. They just need to experience your burnout through the quality of your work.  Your boss sounds reasonable enough not to chew you out for looking for a job so talk to them and see if you can work it out. Just be honest and say youre only looking because youre burning out and this is a 2 person job. Dont say you specifically need help because that could be translated as Im not good enough just say this is a 2 person job. Convince them its in their best interest to have 2 people and you should be safe.
hmcl88j,DriftWithoutCar,11/27/2021,1,Isnt strange in r/personalfinance thats for sure.
hmcgjxd,housespeciallomein,11/27/2021,1,I don’t have much to add. I think this response and birdy_cephon’s are really good. One thing I would add is that since he’s been abuse you should limit your involvement perhaps identify some boundaries for your involvement ahead of time. Sorry you’re going thru this (and your dad).
hmcqha8,alanmitch34,11/27/2021,1,Two thoughts for your consideration: 1. As others have mentioned sell for tax loss purposes to offset some gains. You can always buy the stock back in 31 days to avoid the wash sale rule (if you have regrets or still like the company)  2. If you have 100 shares or more of a stock and decide to sell consider selling a call option instead.  Get paid a little extra to say goodbye. You can sell these in the money (higher probability of selling away)...or press your luck and if needed keep writing new calls after each expiration to generate a nice dividend until you sell them away.
hmaah5q,raznog,11/27/2021,1,Most banks just call it “bill pay” and for major businesses they can ACH the funds otherwise you put in the address and account info/name and they mail the check out. It’s very handy.
hmax8kt,PieceofTheseus,11/27/2021,1,That sound really wrong price for that type of an ER visit.  The visit should cost around 2.5K with the CT being around 1-5K.  For Gallstones mine was 3.8K with CT and ultrasound.
hmazeh1,unbalancedcheckbook,11/27/2021,1,There are certain marriage penalties in the tax code so dont expect to save on taxes unless your income levels are wildly different.  Anyway dont do it or not do it for financial reasons. IMO  the main reason to get married (as opposed to just moving in together and agreeing to share everything) is that it legally codifies your relationship.  If youre legally in the grey zone between single and married things can be a lot more complicated when it comes to property ownership children medical authority etc.   That said Im not saying to rush in either... Just that the idea that you should be financially independent first is not really that relevant.   Sharing living expenses is a great thing to do financially however.   If you have one dwelling instead of two you will make a lot more headway in your financial goals.
hmbk9jn,bobcats2002,11/27/2021,1,What do you mean hard mode? Is it factoring in my credit score because its in the mid-700s.
hmbbqj0,SolutionLeading,11/27/2021,1,Online grad school would be cheaper especially for you since you could continue to live at home and save money on living expenses and gas. And some schools offer discounted tuition for online degrees. I don’t know much about social work but it seems like an online degree vs in person wouldn’t matter so much. I would definitely look into it.
hmbk366,Undercovergreen,11/27/2021,1,Its pretty east for you to check what it would cost from another provider. That said its not crazy for you to be paying that at your age if its comprehensive
hmc8t7g,notoutofcontrol,11/27/2021,1,Agreed. You’re crazy not to be always looking to improve your position which often means having your resume public. No normal employer should have a problem with that. Also you don’t have to feel compelled to stay just because your employer paid for training assuming there isn’t a contract of obligation in return (definitely don’t sign something like that!). Take the training because it’ll improve your value and keep looking for something better.   And don’t take a new thing unless it’s obviously better.
hmd4e3b,DigitalPelvis,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for being reasonable regarding the “don’t buy with someone other than a spouse” advice. My partner and I have been together 9 years own our second house together have owned multiple cars together joint finances have a kid…just not sure marriage makes financial sense for us right now based on our incomes.
hmd3vqi,Key-Emu5781,11/27/2021,1,It turned out that I have just some abnormal beating (I don’t remember exactly what she said) just that it’s not harmful everything is fine but just developed beating more on right side or something ? I don’t remember I just remember being relieved it wasn’t harmful.
hmaj0q0,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,>My sister believes you shouldn’t marry someone till you can support yourself completely financially because she doesn’t want to rely on them.  I dont need to read past that sentence. Your sister has stated her priority. The rest of her financial advice is anchored in that priority.    I am not saying your sister is wrong. I will say that my wife and I did not have this philosophy when we got married right out of college.
hmd7kdv,fenduru,11/27/2021,1,The $19500 limit is just what you contributed and does not include your employers contribution (the combined limit is $58000)
hmb7cin,Quality_Manager,11/27/2021,1,They have a cpa. I am just asking. I don’t really talk to them about it that’s why I am asking out of curiousity
hmbjev6,UGA10,11/27/2021,1,1.  $65000 is a lot. Nothing wrong with putting some in a brokerage account.  Just make sure you have a 6 month emergency fund NOT in the market.   2.  A Roth IRA is a good option but you would need to do backdoor roth contributions.  Do you have any pre-tax money in a Traditional IRA currently?  If so you will run into the pro rata rule.   3.  1.8% is low enough that you are most likely better off investing money over paying extra towards the loans. That said nobody will fault you for trying to get out of debt faster.

hmd28s3,sunsoutbunzout,11/27/2021,1,Info: can you substantiate your payments between February and August? Have you proven date of ownership to the utility? Some utilities limit liability of past due accounts only to others who have benefitted from the service which wouldn’t apply to you if you just moved there and can show proof of service/housing elsewhere during the time the debt was incurred.

hmboq04,throwaway1937725,11/27/2021,1,You’re not giving a lot of details here - like your income or expenses. Life is expensive and it’s 100% possible that your sister doesn’t believe you and your SO make enough (or will ever make enough) to survive on your own and she’s just beating around the bush.
hm9q2ei,roombataxi,11/27/2021,1,You have to look at your time horizon - how long until you want to have the money.  Over the long haul there are going to be significant ups and downs and you have to ride them out if you dont intend on using the money in the short term.  When you get closer to needing the money thats when you start transferring to a less risky / more safe investment like bonds or money market funds.   Think about your time horizon and that will let you know how much you should be considereing whether to move the money or not.
hmbyqg6,Sveet_Pickle,11/27/2021,1,I know prices have gone up but I bought my house in SC last year for 120k. Just shy of a quarter acre 1300 Sq ft
hma30eb,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,> I thought it had to be taken out of paychecks.    401(k)s have to come out of paychecks but IRAs you can contribute to at-will but only up to as much as your earned income throughout the tax year. So if your earned income is $4k your IRA max contributions is $4k. If its $6k or higher your limit is $6k/yr....but you can 100% fund it in Jan as long as your earned income by year end is $6k or more.
hmavt0d,Duplicitous2,11/27/2021,1,One of the worst offenders for this is buy here pay here car lenders and they make money on the down payments not the financing. Imagine if you could collect 1000 up front on a car worth about 5k total knowing you would have to repossess in 60 days anyway. Then you get the car back and sell it to the next person rinse lather repeat.

hmdaryl,Varathien,11/27/2021,1,>Ask Family for Help. Pride and insecurities are really getting in the way of this but Im considering it.  If you have family members who are wealthy enough and generous enough to loan you $23000 this is by far the best option. The blow to your pride is a good thing... maybe itll deter you from cathartic spending in the future.
hmdapax,McFuzzen,11/27/2021,1,Same here. The only scenario I could come up with that would make the PPO worth it over the HDHP was a single large event like a really expensive visit to the ER with no follow up appointments. Even then it barely was cheaper.

Your policy is still valid in case an insured title problem arises. Keep that policy as long as you own the property. It will even protect your heirs from title risks.    https://covenanttitle.com/2018/04/25/insurance/how-long-does-title-insurance-last/

hmbd3y1,SCwareagle,11/27/2021,1,See if he would be interested in checking out The Money Guy. I liked Dave and his philosophy and it was my intro to personal finance. But I like the Money Guy approach even better.   I would say Dave is perfect for those who really struggle with the behavior side of personal finance and need very strict controls and boundaries. Money Guy is better for those trying to be as efficient as possible. Tons of overlap in philosophy though.  Also watching or listening to some of it together and discussing could be a good tool to make sure you are on the same page in terms of financial philosophy and goals.

hmbrdis,ZookyTheClown,11/27/2021,1,If allowed in your state ask to share the commission she makes with you and your spouse.
hmc9196,TheophrastBombast,11/27/2021,1,Maybe the person making less money could technically pay more than they would have otherwise. Taxes are typically taken out of each pay check ahead of time so maybe more taxes are taken out to cover the higher tax brackets. Maybe they would expect a big tax return but now that doesnt happen. Or maybe their partner didnt get as much tax withheld as they should have and now they have to use their savings to pay their owed taxes and they do it equally but in really one was paying more taxes the whole year and now has to cover half the others bill.      Granted that doesnt really matter if you combine income into a single account but if they do it in another way it could skew the balance.
hma0a7o,Zootallurs,11/27/2021,1,You’ll probably be fine. A few things to consider.  1) I’d want quite a bit more liquid before leaving my job. Sure you’ll get that small pension but who knows what happens with your “second career?” It could take a long time to find the role you want it may pay a lot less than you expect you may end up hating it and want to leave after 6 months.   2) Take a hard look at your retirement savings. General guidance is that you want 6X your salary by the time you hit 50. I’m assuming the savings numbers you shared are for you and your SO combined and your salary is just you right? Even if your SO makes 1/2 what you do that means you want ~$800k in retirement accounts by 50. You can back your pension out of that if you don’t want to be so aggressive.   3) Get serious about the real estate. You didn’t give a lot of info but if the rents just “cover the mortgage” you’re losing money. I would liquidate the rental properties and redeploy that capital to better RE investments. I personally think REI is the best retirement plan but you have to be smart and disciplined about it.
hm8zse9,Adept-One-666,11/27/2021,16,I’m just a Joe Schmo but I do have some banking background in my life. This bank teller is out of his mind change banks immediately. This guy knows your bank account amount your home address your social security number. Who knows what this guy could be up to?

hmbzzwu,Discipulus42,11/27/2021,1,You just need to be using the card each month.  Just pay it off in full every month so you don’t end up paying that interest rate.    If you don’t already have them set up you should establish a checking and savings account for yourself in your own name.  Ideally in a way that has minimal or no cost to you.
hmculfr,bgabu84,11/27/2021,1,Doctors don’t handle billing. Period.
hmae6t6,Earthquake14,11/27/2021,1,I think my 5% was like $125 per paycheck so with company’s contribution it’s around $500 a month iirc. After the raise it’s gonna be $166 so $666 per month with company’s match. I’m 25 so I’m pretty comfortable with this amount for now. Not 100% sure of my partners numbers.
hmaabzz,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,Thank you! This helps so much. My husband and I have a great marriage and cant see ourselves divorcing but he is the child of divorced parents (and Im the child of parents who should have gotten divorced) and we wanted to be realistic. Friends of ours are also going through a somewhat messy divorce currently so we just happen to be seeing what a bad one can look like. Its not on the table nor do I think it ever will be but the idea that I may not have rights to certain assets in a divorce (even though Ill be paying toward the mortgage with him each month from our joint account) was nerve wracking. Thanks for the info!
hmbchfd,cm253,11/27/2021,1,This needs to be higher.  Marriage is cheap cheaper than two people being single.  Divorce is expensive.  Its costs are not only financial but the financial costs are high.  Marry because you want to be married not for any perceived financial benefit.  Stay single because its the right choice for you not because you think marriage is too expensive.  My husband any I spent about $1000 on our marriage rings included.  Still together 12 years later.  We went from broke as a couple of jokes to early retirement.  Money was not and has never been the reason.
hm9iesa,UserName4lreadyTak3n,11/27/2021,1,It’s maybe 2-week turnaround from experience. If your parent have multiple cards and no fraudulent transactions observed maybe spread out the re-issue..?   Banks would rather pay for a rectangular bit of plastic than be on the hook for tens of thousands of fraudulent transactions so free re-issue if you report your card as being skimmed etc is worth it for them  The gotchas with re-issue:  - Need to re-establish billing for subscriptions  - Autopay may stop working
hmd9whe,Cheddar_Ham,11/27/2021,1,I make $450k around your age and still have a great life as a single guy spending $3300/mo pre-pandemic then $2900 during pandemic in NYC on the upper east side. I havent wanted for anything. I think you can definitely afford $4500 but Id ask myself what you are getting for that price that you cant get for $1k lower. Either way the world is your oyster!
hmbeeso,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/27/2021,1,Think of spending money on your happiness as an investment — one to keep you productive.  You could also try to hunt for deals to combat your ingrained frugality.  Eg get a $400 pair of noise cancelling headphones on sale for $150 maximize the miles and points game to get a $300/night room for $75 worth of points etc.  That way you could treat yourself while also meeting your impulse to be frugal.
hmc2i2q,Nova_Nightmare,11/27/2021,1,Im curious how it would be tax fraud? Is there some rule that they couldnt sell a vehicle for almost nothing if its coming from a business?
hmd47dt,one_ugly_dude,11/27/2021,1,Ive seen a lot of people take a step down and keep their salary. In fact I once went from a department manager to assistant department manager and got a $1.20/hr RAISE.
hmb2okw,lippoper,11/27/2021,1,You want a safe investment. But are afraid of the rewards?  I’m confused. You want to get paid less for your dollar then buy bonds under your parents portfolio?
hmbr5un,Ok_Employee_9612,11/27/2021,1,You didn’t give people much to work with.  The simple answer is yes but like everyone else said if you don’t change the behavior it’s pointless.  I was you in my 20s and 30s.  Had a ton of CC debt paid it all off with a real estate transaction then found myself in the same situation 5 years later.  I finally said enough is enough got after my debt and focused on raising my income.  Now in my 40s I basically have a mortgage and that’s it.  Not sure how old you are but the sooner you make the change the better your older self will be.  I would call myself really good with money now but in my younger days I was a train-wreck!  My wife had to change too so you need to get your GF on board too.
hm91ifn,beldaran1224,11/27/2021,75,Target does this with both internal and external theft. Theyll deliberately wait until it is a felony amount.

hmb8ztq,antifaction,11/27/2021,1,For a 700 sq foot apartment I would expect the heating bill to be about 200 dollars for an average daily temperature at 40 degrees with electric heat. Do you know you over all cost per kilowatt hour? There may be something wrong with your heating system- the meter is likely fine since it was working all year.
hmd24bp,FutureBarrySeal,11/27/2021,1,Just remember you can’t take it with you to the grave.  One day the music stops for everyone. The amount of money you have then won’t make much difference… I have an uncle who is like you. He’s a MULTI millionaire who never eats out never buys anything new and has almost no bills at all. His clothes have holes in it and his children are doctors who are very wealthy. He doesn’t even get surgery for his hernia because he doesn’t want to spend the $5k for it. So lives in pain. None of us know why he does it but he does. His wife hates him for it and his relationship with his wife has crumbled towards the later stages of his life…. And all for what? To die with $10m+ in your bank which just goes to your kids?   Being frugal isn’t a bad thing but there is limits to it. You make enough to be able to save a good amount of money while having a really good QOL. That’s what the money is being made for. It’s made so you can make your life better. Why give that up? Reap the rewards of your hard labor. Start living my friend. You can buy new clothes and keep the cost low… I personally enjoy wearing clothes from Walmart and target. They’re like $10-$20/ per item… maybe even less. Shop around for deals….   Just relax and start spending some money.
hmc3zo6,hopingtothrive,11/27/2021,1,>She is a realtor is name only has never sold a house  >She doesn’t speak English  You need an experienced realtor. Its going to hurt feelings but its your wifes job to talk to her mother and tell her the news. Do not be pressured into getting a messed up job done just to support your MIL for a year.  Dont assume that realtors do nothing. This is a legal transaction and things can go wrong or get complicated. Would anyone hire a person who didnt speak the language to handle a legal contract?
hmage4j,RoastyMcGiblets,11/27/2021,1,> Land is one of the best things you can own.  Absolutely not true.
hmb3q4l,kalli007,11/27/2021,1,In our state Texas documenting the expenses has zero effect if you are married (or if someone is trying to prove you are) as it’s a community property state. A contract would absolutely be beneficial in this situation as the lack of written agreement has been used to imply common law marriage. Fortunately the bar is set pretty high in Texas courts since the addition of the third criteria in 1989 - but the vast majority of the common law suits brought in the state boil down to property disputes due to lack of written documentation/contract.  I don’t say all of this to be argumentative I say it having experienced it as a bystander and watching someone go through a six month long process costing thousands of dollars and wishing they had taken proactive steps to protect themselves in the beginning. People can get really shitty when they think they can get some money.
hmbls82,Alwayssunnyinarizona,11/27/2021,1,Nevermind the OP never specified *where* in Wisconsin.
hmcwxyo,TodaysMenace,11/27/2021,1,Top dollar for these usually comes from auctions. Find a local auction house that will list them for you either in lots or as single items or both. Make sure the auction house utilizes online auctioning.   Good luck!

hmcgd7a,Realistic_Honey7081,11/27/2021,1,Not stopping educationally. Continuing to learn.  Networking. Finding suitable interests that allow you to meet people outside of your routine where you can form bonds based upon your mutual interest. Examples: political grass roots campaigns tennis full contact no protective gear rugby amateur MMA fighting bird spotting geo caching sex clubs really what ever. Just anything with a social element. You can get the scoop on once in a life time opportunities or have somebody let you into the back door of a business that doesn’t normally let you past security. Super helpful if your trying to sell your mix tape.  Staying mentally and physically healthy. Huge medical bills inability to pass in generational wealth or crashing and burning won’t help you.  Actually enjoying your life in general. What’s the point of anything if you don’t have some measure of pleasure and satisfaction. This can tye back into the networking activities. Making friends while y’all are both pursuing happiness is a powerful network leverage.
hmd0xqr,Bort_Bortson,11/27/2021,1,Probably along the lines of what others suggested. You were assigned an account for profit sharing or pension but since you left after 18 months most if not all of the money wasnt vested meaning you lost it.  The net benefits and fidelity make sense the previous job I had was with a large cpa firm and the profit share went into an account with almost the same name if not the exact same name but that could be super generic idk. It was treated the same as a 401k match just a lump sum. It also deposited to a default target date fund my first year so future years I had it changed to match what I was investing in out of each paycheck.  From that job 20% of the first years amount was vested increasing 20% till year 6 when everything prior and that year was 100% mine so even though I left Id December I kept the entire amount from the 5 prior years plus 95% of year since it was prorated just a bit but still I made enough time to take it all with me.  So if was similar and your old job followed the same plan you might have been able to keep 20% of whatever they deposited.

hmcpj6j,dj92wa,11/27/2021,1,Thats.....thats not how emergency funds work. You want MUCH more than your deductible. Emergency fund is meant to cover a period of time i.e. you get fired or injured and arent being paid 100% while youre temporarily out of work or something happens that insurance wont cover or will only partially cover. If your house burned to the ground it could take MONTHS for the insurance claim to be processed through. With what money do you buy temporary shelter food and new clothing with if you didnt have an emergency fund? Credit cards? Dig yourself into debts that could have been totally avoided?
hmbx9gr,BastidChimp,11/27/2021,1,Stick to no annual fee credit cards that offer points or cash back. Use them only on essential purchases like food and gas. Pay off the balance every month.
hm8ymgg,ssjhook,11/27/2021,1,dad definitely isnt dumb some financial advisors may even suggest you cut off your 401k completely until your debt is gone and you certainly need an emergency fund
hmavwgo,Johnny09876,11/27/2021,1,It seems like they always raise rent but not enough to make it worthwhile to move.  Anyway just see if you can go month-to-month for a few months.
hmclkwq,lzwzli,11/27/2021,1,Wow. So assuming you get a 4% raise every year in 4 years youll be contributing 20% of your paycheck to your 401k?  Im assuming you did the math so that you dont exceed the yearly contribution max and lose out on the company match?
hmced5e,Ameteur_Professional,11/27/2021,1,I wont disagree that theres no need to rush but also not everyone is going to want to wait 10 years.  Marriage can be a very important legal and financial prerequisite to a lot of things. Marriage comes with a lot of tangible benefits and if you want to marry someone theres no reason to wait 10 years because your 20s is so early  The way OP phrased their comment sounds like theyre at least entertaining the possibility of kids (based on their comment of their sister not wanting them) and especially if you want several kids it generally makes a lot more sense to start in your 20s rather than your 30s.  Most people consider marriage as something they want before having kids as well as often something to do before buying a house with someone.  OP should get married when they truly believe this is the person they want to spend their life with and are ready to commit to that.

hmcih6g,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,1,Im in the exact situation except with my current employer there is a 1 year waiting period until i can begin 401k contributions.

I plan to transfer my old 401k as soon as possible once i hit my 1 year mark. It’s actually next week so I’m excited to get that ball rolling again.

hmabif6,joeshmo39,11/27/2021,1,The non negotiable travel expense may well need to be negotiated but your budget needs a bigger makeover.  Where is your money going? Youre grossing 8k a month so maybe 5500 a month net. 2600 is essentials where is the other 3k going? A few hundred a month to travel but you have credit card debt so youre living outside your means. You need a line by line budget you need to pull and review your credit card and bank statements.   Youre also not in a good spot cash wise. 10k total liquid cash with a mortgage and maybe a kid is not nearly enough. Youre substantially behind on retirement unless theres a government pension in the mix and maybe even then.  Throw in daycare expenses or a parent leaving their job to stay home with baby and youre broke.  Sorry I know the advice on this thread has been positive but I view this as more precarious. Im 34 with young kids so do consider this perspective.

hmb3bhv,bigbura,11/27/2021,1,Arent financial woes one of the top 3 reasons for divorce? Pre-marriage counseling should cover this issue and many more.   What or how other people think about handling money doesnt really matter to any one couple.   What is important is how a specific couple feels about money issues.   The best time to find out how well their feelings align is prior to marrying hence the advice for couples to make the time for pre-marriage counseling.
hma67xd,DeluxeXL,11/27/2021,1,> It would have been better for you to sign Provider B’s forms to allow a direct transfer of funds from A to B (without any checks being involved).

hmc0efn,bicyclemom,11/27/2021,1,Its actually cheaper than living apart because you are combining expenses.  Still her advice isnt bad.   Being able to support yourself is important period.

hmd7x3w,TinyTerryJeffords,11/27/2021,1,Yeah it doesnt make sense because the author misspoke using the term interest but returns on a stock do also compound if the stock continues increasing in value. If you sell every year you realize those gains instead of letting them compound. In this case it would be referred to as a return on your investment not interest. But it does still compound over time.

hmblzul,metstickets719,11/27/2021,1,If you plan to invest in vanguard funds it probably makes sense to open a vanguard account as I believe Fidelity charges extra fees for investing in those funds. You could also look into the fidelity equivalent of the funds you wish to invest in. I am into the Bogleheads approach so Im roughly 75/25 split between FZROX & FZILX which are the zero expense funds with Fidelity. FZROX is similar to VTI while FZILX is similar to VXUS.
hmci6fg,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,In that case the 3% they put in the 401k isnt connected to what youre putting in the 403b. Theyre 2 completely separate plans. They do share a limit though. Employee contributions cant be over $19500 for 2021 across both plans.   Not clear why they have 2 but it may be because 403b plans are exempt from discrimination testing and 401k plans are not.

hmajqnk,93195,11/27/2021,1,The high interest rates.  If you’re charging 30%+ and even if 1 in 4 defaults you’re still fine.  This is the argument payday lenders use to even stay legal and be allowed to operate - they provide a “service” by making loans to people that no one else will.

hmct25u,TekkerJohn,11/27/2021,1,My college gym was an inconvenient walk. I ran the mile there and mile back and made them part of the workout. I think your looking at that part wrong. Somehow you pay for the college gym. Why pay for two gym memberships.

hmd1hpr,Onwisconsin42,11/27/2021,1,Its ok to be frugal but sometimes being frugal comes at its own cost. How much would I pay someone to do my dishes? Not much I can do it myself. How much would pay someone to make me a meal when Im tired and on the go? Heres 10 dollars. How much would I pay someone to fix scars all over my face? Thousands of dollars. But it doesnt cost that much you are already insured talk to a doctor about this acne and you can likely get a prescription at little to no cost covered by insurance even better if you have access to an HSA or FSA.
hmarxhh,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,As long as you pay (at minimum) the statement balance before the cutoff time of the due date is fine. This will avoid interest (on all but the most predatory of cards) and give you the paid on time mark.  &#x200B  You can pay for things as soon as they post (show on current balance) but that is unnecessary. Think back to the days of paying by check and mail and how annoying that would have been for everyone calling up every few days to check balance and sending out multiple checks each month.
hmd4itk,Earthquake14,11/27/2021,1,For my occupation average salary in California is about 15% higher. But yeah idk how you do it.   Maybe it has to do with the fact I’ve only been working for less than 3 years and don’t have enough saved for a larger down payment. If I had more to put down I’d go up more in total budget.
hmaubbg,Motobugs,11/27/2021,1,You havent paid yet. Wheres the rip off? Dont be too dramatic.
hma6dwp,cballowe,11/27/2021,1,Thats what theyre getting to at the moment. They get told were shipping you X with options A B C and then they sell it. You can try to negotiate but theres pretty much no room to move in that as theyll have a buyer at full price.

Once your 401k is maxed Roth is maxed HSA is maxed and youve set aside a comfortable amount for emergencies then lifestyle creep is generally ok.  Im a similar age to you went from ~70k 5 years ago to ~120k total comp now. My take home pay is almost no exactly the same after all contributions. Thats how you battle lifestyle creep.

So dont worry and dont waste time on that. If it is an error then IT IS THEIR ERROR. not your. Specially you didnt sigh any new contract for a new wage. I am sure this is illegal if they want to take those money back.    Good luck and enjoy the money.
hm999sr,roombataxi,11/27/2021,2,Assuming car prices are 10-20% overpriced then youre looking at an extra 2000-4000 youre paying that you wouldnt otherwise pay.  So for your $20K you spend youll be getting $16K worth of vehicle.  Its not ideal but it will get the job done for what you need. Shop hard for a good deal but get it done so you can have wheels when you need them.
hmaiurc,raznog,11/27/2021,1,Oh I have many great stories too. But they all stopped a few years back. As of about 4 years ago everything went from amazing to very lackluster but they still have their high prices. There was a time I was okay with the extra cost because I knew they were good for it. Not so much anymore.   And a bank returning money due to fraud is t exactly unique to usaa. That’s a bare minimum requirement for a bank.

You should definitely be angling for that.

hma8iob,psalm139x,11/27/2021,1,Also Michigan here.   First your budget is awesome. Nice job! Im impressed with how dialed in you are.   The two things I noticed is that your gas/electric with most likely be higher than $70. I have a pretty small house and keep my thermostat low but in the winter my gas is at least $70 alone. In the summer its the air conditioning. Factor in Christmas lights for a few months and it might be more like $120 together.   You also might want to add a Charity category.  There is always something to give money to. I see the gift category but I have found that setting aside some money every month for others makes me less of a miser.
hmbnu5w,burn-my-dread,11/27/2021,1,That is a possibility but it also possible that the other company wont work out. If they gave you the counter off you mentioned they want to keep you.
hmc5pwp,ConsentIsTheMagicKey,11/27/2021,1,Over the lifetime of the loan $25000 isn’t much. If the nicer house will suit your needs better over a longer term then buy it. You will still be able to have a nice savings. And consider maintenance costs updating costs etc. The more expensive house could end up being cheaper than the less expensive houses.   Are you getting married? How will the ownership of the house be addressed? You should have some kind of legal agreement.
hma1x2i,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,Thank you. I appreciate your response! I had kids while I was a married SAHM to someone earning $80000. He became physically abusive (in other ways too) and nearly killed me one night. That was the last straw and we separated soon after that. (Yes I should have left him much sooner.) He was highly opposed to me working (He wanted me to be completely dependent on him just to control me.) and I will always regret that I didnt pursue my Masters degree or other educational/career paths earlier.   I agree that I need more income but how? I just spent two hours this morning searching entry level jobs on Indeed. Probably 90% of the jobs I saw pay as much as what I currently make teaching preschool. Others like recruiting engineering banking etc. pay more but I dont think I would get hired for any of them because I literally have no qualifications experience or interest in those jobs. I did see something about becoming a behavior counselor for kids with autism and they seem to want people in the evenings so maybe I can try that as a second job but childcare is an issue.   Also one of the major reasons I teach preschool is because this school gives me an enormous childcare discount to bring my own kids with me. In the past I worked in a public school but then my childcare expenses were triple what they are now (and I would not have qualified for any assistance) and I was basically in the exact same boat. In addition this preschool transports my children to their elementary schools which would be almost impossible for me to do myself if I had another job. And I dont have any friends or family who can help me with babysitting or transportation. My kids arent old enough to stay home by themselves.   Im working on a Masters degree in education. Where I currently live Ill start out earning $76000 once I graduate and the salary increases by about $2000 - $3000 per year after that. Is it the best path? Im not certain but considering that I have NO other experience besides teaching and caring for kids...it seems like the best way forward for now. I have considered trying to get some IT certifications in the future as another career.
hmcjqw0,Frozenlazer,11/27/2021,1,Since youll need both incomes to qualify for a loan as big as you are talking its kinda a moot point unless you want to wait and work on his score.  However you might find that the difference in actual costs on your loan arent that huge. Youll just have to talk some lenders and see .
hmappdp,AutoModerator,11/27/2021,1,Heres a **[link to the PF Wiki](/r/personalfinance/wiki/index)** for helpful guides and information.  *I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

hmb62fc,atx78701,11/27/2021,1,there is something called the rule of 72. Divide 72 by the interest rate and that is how many years it takes your money to double.  Historical returns are around 10% in the market so your money doubles every 7 years. At 25 and a retirement age of 65 you have around 5 doubles of any money you invest today. Every dollar you invest right now will be worth about 16X at 65.  If you save and invest 30% of your pretax income in the S&P 500 in about 25 years your money will be making as much as what you live on (about 50% of your pretax income).  If you dont want to do research just put your money into an S&P 500 index fund.  You do want about 6 months of expenses in cash in an emergency fund.
hmbupsf,Anonymoose2021,11/27/2021,1,The other factor is time until expiration of the option.   Im guessing that the $15 NQs are older than the $26 NQs.    I would exercise and sell the older NQs and then also exercise some of the older ISOs but not sell them.    How much of the ISOs you exercise depends on how much cash you have and at what point you would have to start paying tax on them. AMT exemption is about $115k and phaseout starts at taxable income of just over $1M (married filing jointly) so you should be able to exercise about 2800 shares of the $9 strike ISO and not owe any tax from that exercise.   That of course depends upon your other income and any AMT preference items you might have but that is a good guess for a start.     In other words you have an AMT exemption each year that you should be using to your advantage.  AMT exemption for single filer is $73.6K and phaseout starting at $523K.
hmbs669,cshermyo,11/27/2021,1,Have you thought about 3D renderings for real estate developers and other construction projects? That’s a somewhat niche but profitable market and seems like it would mesh well with your experience and education.

hm9mom5,decaturbob,11/27/2021,2, - depends on location.  - most people who comment on mobile homes have never lived in one or bought one/  - I bought a brand new one when I was in the USAF and owned it for 3 years and sold it for practically the same price I paid for it.  My cost of housing then boiled done to the lot rent and the utilities and I was way better off than all those who rented. My guess at the time. I spent less than 25% on OWNING and living in a mobile home than those who rented. The other 75% went into my pocket

hmda1sw,etblo,11/27/2021,1,True it was a very small leak but when i first looked at the house the realtor asked if i smelled gas i couldnt smell it. After i closed on the house the guys from the water department got the water turned on and smelled the leak so they called nyseg guy for me to come fix it. So my guess its been a tiny leak going on for at minimum a month before i bought the house but at most could be at the last reading date listed on my bill which was 2019

hm9wfw3,aaaaij,11/27/2021,1,The great thing about investing in highly diversified index funds is that there really is absolutely no reason to worry. If your investments go down so does everyone elses. There is no need to check - the news will tell you if something major happens and when the next 2008 housing crisis or 2020 pandemic comes along where things really tumble you will definitely know about it and can do what you can to BUY MORE while the price is low.

hmcvdcu,SlowlyTowardsTheCake,11/27/2021,1,Just went through this in the same situation. My salary is high credit is good (700ish). Wife’s salary is $0 (SAHM) and her credit is 800+. The catch for us was that we went through a credit union and had more than 20% down so we didn’t need PMI and thus the CU didn’t have to adhere to federal guidelines in approving us since they would hold the mortgage until payoff (it won’t be sold). In our case they used my wife’s score in determining approval
hmd4q4c,Ainulindala,11/27/2021,1,Id second the advice to pay down the 1.8% student loans at the regular non-accelerated rate and invest the extra money instead. Lots of places you can get more than 1.8% safely. (For instance both you and your spouse can buy $10000 in i-bonds each year. They have a variable rate that tracks inflation so the current rate is like 7% or something crazy like that. Hopefully that doesnt last.)

hmcop24,Rxew,11/27/2021,1,If you can pay the taxes on whatever balance is in your IRA out of pocket then go for it.  If not - best to roll it into your 401k first.
hmbu58a,Riza101z,11/27/2021,1,If we get married when I graduate college that will be in about 3 years. My sister is currently 20 almost 21
hma5grp,Ecstatic_Assumption5,11/27/2021,1,obviously no one forced me Im not very good at writing
hmbsk9c,GreedyNovel,11/27/2021,1,How do you plan to handle taxes?
hm9b4ke,Julia_Kat,11/27/2021,1,Yeah throw that fact in too. This WOULD have been our 4th car we bought here. Shame were gonna have to find a new dealership. I dont think the what? $180 over the course of 6 years is worth losing a customer over.
hmd35qq,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/27/2021,1,It’s a finance subreddit and lenders want to know about regular expenses before they determine what they are loaning out. They’ll be curious about that.
hmcy4j5,DeadlyDuckie,11/27/2021,1,Wasnt a problem at all but they wanted like 6 months of stubs and I think 3 years of tax returns? I cant remember for sure but yeah they didnt have issues with it
hmd13a2,JennItalia269,11/27/2021,1,I’ve done it for small amounts due to timing etc.  I would ask them if you could or they could allow for a small credit increases (less likely to be granted) or just split the purchase between that card and cash at the point of sale.
hmca1pr,LiveResearcher2,11/27/2021,1,Can you clarify why “Young and attractive” matters for this particular topic?
hmakwa2,Its-a-write-off,11/27/2021,1,Not directly. Hed have income from the business and then a separate endeavor investing in real estate. He may or may not have losses from the real estate and may or may not be able to deduct it against his other income.  But the initial investment isnt a deduction no. Its an investment.
hmcxxtt,SewOnAndSewForth,11/27/2021,1,Whenever I get a raise I split it between my retirement savings and a savings account. So if I was getting a 4% raise I would divert that percentage of my pay between the two.
hmd5zoo,DarklightNS,11/27/2021,1,Show your contract to an lawyer.  Even if our first instinct says no way i can imagine a toxic company trying such stunt. Lets hope its just that a stunt without legal foundation to back it up and thats quite possible. (Source: Family members had to do with a shady employer just randomly doing toxic things and asking for stuff.)   Obviously we can hardly check it for you and even if we could most of us arent in the position to give you legal advice so thats your best bet.
hmclnpq,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,Autopay full statement balance by due date to avoid interest charges.
hmd3wzb,starberd,11/27/2021,1,Yes.   It’s called direct billing versus submitting your bill to your health insurer.
hmblluv,trexmoflex,11/27/2021,1,Is this true? I honestly don’t know but a family acquaintance buys it up then like… restores it and sells carbon credits off the land. Makes a lot of money doing this.
hmcwrse,Educational_Lobster6,11/27/2021,1,It really depends on how frugal you are overall and how creative you can be with your meal preparation to keep your food expenditures to a minimum. In theory you could pull another $500 from savings every month for more than a year and a half which would give you $1000/month for living expenses above and beyond your rent.   I would view the savings as a safety net while you get out of your abusive situation but don’t plan to drain the account to $0. You need to find a better paying job to give you more income to work with. If you are in an expensive city as you say more and more retail health aid and food service jobs are paying $15+/hour which isn’t “enough” of course but more than double the minimum wage you are making now.
hmc15c1,Iz-kan-reddit,11/27/2021,1,Youre saying your buddy is a scumbag?
hmbwbir,tetondream,11/27/2021,1,You might be paying for your neighbors heat as well. I would turn off all the circuit breakers in your main electric in panel.  See if your neighbor complains they have no heat or power.
hmcv862,happy-cig,11/27/2021,1,Even though you pay off your credit card it wont immediately reflect on credit reports. It also depends on when the data is pulled.
hmbob7k,mrchaotica,11/27/2021,1,Thats true but the inconvenience risk and expense to accomplish that devalues the property compared to one that has frontage on a public road.
hmaktib,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,If the card hasnt come then it is likely not even On your report yet so canceling quickly should cause zero impact.
hmcd0j6,Gotanis55,11/27/2021,1,So initially I was planning on putting just over 20% down.  I talked to my lender today and we had a discussion about it. His suggestion was that I put the minimum down for the best interest rate (5% down) ride the wave and when it perks back up sell off enough to pay an additional 15% off  canceling my need for mortgage insurance. This seems like a good compromise.
hmcu212,Smgt90,11/27/2021,1,I support this approach. 21 is too young why rush a marriage?
hmafsbu,ASDF0716,11/27/2021,1,Same.  I switched from BoA to PNC in 2011.  Nothing but good things.
hmd14rm,DoomBuggE,11/27/2021,1,RN here. This is simply the peril of having a high deductible plan. This is not a coding mistake or a billing mistake. You were charged for a diagnostic exam because by definition that’s what an echocardiogram is. It’s not possible to code this as preventative without committing billing fraud. The echo was ordered in response to an abnormal finding and that’s where you go from “routine preventative visit” to “problem visit” therefore your deductible applies. Talking to the doctor’s office won’t change that.  Very few services are considered preventative care. If you have any work up of anything abnormal at all - abnormal EKG cough/cold symptoms abnormal paps etc. Your $1800 deductible applies for all of these things.  Also why is your GP doing EKGs? This is not routine unless you have cardiac symptoms like fainting dizziness etc. I would actually be surprised that an EKG would be covered as preventative even if results were totally normal.  It’s open enrollment for many. Change your insurance to a deductible you can handle if you can.
hmcb4g1,michaelyup,11/27/2021,1,Agreed and this is where you spend a little money on an accountant to make sure you do things right.
hmcuy2z,keepngoal,11/27/2021,1,Sell the car buy a less expensive mode of transportation (if you can come out ahead as used cars are hot right now).  Look at e-bikes mass transit.  Cars are expensive by nature and depreciate fast.  Otherwise look to refinance at 1/2 the rate you are currently at.
hmd1g76,LatexOne,11/27/2021,1,You are correct utilities follow the property.
hmb8tgj,Pleasant_Carpenter37,11/27/2021,1,I think you replied to the wrong comment
hmbb3z6,2greygirls,11/27/2021,1,That sounds high. A few things I did when living in my 700sf condo with electric heat were: -Keep heat at 64-66 all of the time stop going up and down. -use blankets to keep warm on the couch get used to wearing slippers and a sweater. -use small space heaters for short amounts of time to warm the space you are in rather than cranking the heat for the whole house. -If there are seperate thermostats in bedrooms keep heat lower in there and keep doors closed. -Use area rugs to keep floors better insulated. -use thermal curtains and/or those plastic kits for windows
hmcz8cz,kenji-benji,11/27/2021,1,Not always. Public employees are often in a 457.
hmcdgc8,username156,11/27/2021,1,Stay and take the courses hes offering to pay for. Unless its just too much drama anxiety etc. Then move on. Its a workers market right now and employers are slowly starting to realize that. It sounds like he doesnt want to lose you youre an asset and it sounds like youre not easily replaceable which is a problem hes trying to get ahead of.  As far as a pay cut goes I wouldnt leave for less.  As far as them seeing that your resume is online everyones resume is online nowadays. Im happy at my job. I left a job of 4 years to go where Im at now with a 22% bump in salary. My resume is still online.
hmamsnb,Careful_Height4146,11/27/2021,1,Me? We live in an average home in an average neighborhood. No mortgage fully paid for. Weve customized some things over the decades that make our daily lives better
hm96a9q,AkaCadberry,11/27/2021,1,If you’re that worried about it talk to payroll at work?  Are you sure you didn’t work the same amount of hours twice in a row?  If not… congrats on the extra $226.39.
hmauy1y,lcburgundy,11/27/2021,1,Are you under contract? What does your lender or loan broker say? You need to communicate with them and follow their directions. Making a major move during the purchase and underwriting process with assets you disclosed as being the source of your downpayment may cause your lender to bail and financing to fall through if you are doing it without their permission.
hmd83m1,MediumExplorer,11/27/2021,1,True but the Toyota doesn’t have instant torque and doesn’t go 0-60 in 3.2 seconds :/ that’s a life experience I wouldn’t be getting. But alas $900k is a lot of money to save for
hmctbxa,Jacuul,11/27/2021,1,Warranties are always highly recommended because 99% of the time its just free money for them theres always clauses for them to either not have to actually fix/replace the item or the item just doesnt really break which is the best case scenario but is still just you giving them free money
hm9w9kc,lolzveryfunny,11/27/2021,1,You can mention the counter offer to new firm to get more from them.  Tactfully.  And go from there.
hmbm1s3,bobcats2002,11/27/2021,1,Sorry. What numbers should I focus on?  I have GAP so I understand the car is essentially covered. I dont know what Im paying the insurance for. The maximum for bodily injury is only $60000 on our plan so its not high enough for any severe injuries.   Its my first time really paying attention to it so Im open to any advice.
hmcqinj,LyricalPig,11/27/2021,1,>We cohabitated in an apartment before I purchased the home so we were already comfortable splitting expenses.  Expenses arent the problem.  Its a a breakup with messy legalities depending on how the deed is structured.  God forbid one of them dies now they jointly own a home with the departeds next of kin.  Theres also work and disability benefits that wont apply if they arent married that could benefit them.  Buying a house with someone youre not married to is a dumb idea regardless of how well it works for us!
hmbi6km,lousy_millennium,11/27/2021,1,In the US there are considerations for health care too.

hman9tx,el_rico_pavo_real,11/27/2021,1,What are some of the key benefits of VXUS? Would you recommend I add that to this simple Brokerage account for the exposure to international markets? Dont worry I am just picking your brain not taking your response as formal financial advice. I personally like the idea of exposure to the international markets.

hmb6p87,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,Are you afraid of something specific related to money? I see your mindset with people who grew up poor(ish). Theyre just constantly in a scarcity mindset. If you have some harsh childhood trauma around money maybe you need therapy. That will obviously cost money so youd have to bite the bullet.   Your take home is what? 5K/month? And youre only spending 1000? Not sure how thats possible in VHCOL without 10 roommates.   Did you ever think that maybe you could make *more* money in your life if you had a calmer living situation? More confidence from better skin and clothes?   Finally most of the stuff you mentioned is really not *that* expensive usually. At least not if you just buy a bit at a time. Clothes? Youre in a big city Im assuming so Uniqlo is great for affordable basics. Banana Republic is almost always 50%+ off and has fine business casual office clothes. Skin? You probably have decent health insurance if you make 130K. *Go to a dermatologist.* Thats maybe a couple hundred if you havent met your deductible. For scarring a retinoid is your friend (probably). Differin is over the counter for like $12 and a tube should last a month.
hma5de8,HemingwayHuxley,11/27/2021,1,I make $55k of 96k. My 401k matches 25% up to 1%. So I am contributing $6k to 401k and 6k to Roth IRA. My wife has a pension and puts 15% towards it. Is VTSAX its own entity separate from a Roth IRA? (Sorry Im financially illiterate)

hmadci6,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Depends on the desired quality of life.    You too can retire today if you are OK living out on the street.  Maybe OP is moving back home to a developing country where the population survives on $1 a day. You would only need $17k to survive like that for the rest of your life.
hmctp75,WolverineTherapy,11/27/2021,1,Why would you do this?
hmd59vt,Lurker117,11/27/2021,1,Why would you raise hell with the poor person on the other end of the phone at the insurance company because you dont understand how your insurance works and youre too timid to ask a simple question or two before getting non-emergency procedures done to you?  This Karen mentality needs to go.  Accept responsibility and move on with more knowledge and understanding than you had before.  Dont ruin somebodys day who is just doing their job answering the phone at an insurance company because you are mad at yourself.

hma6z7t,wickedkittylitter,11/27/2021,1,Time is your friend...and a budget.  Set budgeted amounts for every expense category included an entertainment/fun expense category.  Start your budget by figuring how much you want to save every month then set the other categories by how much youve been spending on rent/utilities/food/etc.  As each month passes and you realize that you are able to meet your savings goals and still cover all your budgeted expenses your anxiety should decrease.  If it doesnt a few sessions with a therapist might be needed.

hmb8evn,alto-sun,11/27/2021,1,Im afraid of something terrible happening (cancer natural disaster parent illness recession) and spiraling losing my emergency fund and really struggling. I have struggled with mental health in the past and as a result never feel like any job I have is secure even when it is on paper. So I feel like I need to stockpile money in preparation for the worst.   My parents pull in decent money (I think) but are also frugal and never spend it on for fun things. As a kid I was used to not asking for things and assuming what I got was all we could afford.
hmbhhlr,xxxsoap,11/27/2021,1,There is some solid advice here. To reiterate paying off a debt is a guaranteed return. Having debt isnt a bad thing but theres a difference between a 3.4% Auto Loan and a 16-23% variable interest credit card.   Cryptocurrency markets are volatile so you might be able to get a higher return than 23%. However if the interest owed is lets say 15% on 9k you have to get at least a 45% return on 3k of Cryptocurrency just to break even. Just crunch the numbers but tbh itd be best to pay off the debt and cost average back into your investments.

hmajtpx,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,Others have suggested putting 10 or even 5% down for a house. With how expensive cashing out stocks are relative PMI that might make the most sense.

hmdao1j,ZeroAfro,11/27/2021,1,Wanted to say that in situations where the employee has been overpaid Ive seen it several times where the company has successfully and legally been in the right to ask for money back. Not saying that it would be legal here but but it could be.
hm9oa4c,trollreign,11/27/2021,1,Extremely bad advice in my opinion. Personal finance is not a math problem. It’s 80% personal and 20% finance at best. Life will mess with you you lose your job or you get a divorce or you lose your parents etc. Shit happens.  It’s way better to set up an emergency fund and get rid of student loans first then you can start saving for retirement and investing. Financial stability is the basis of both a satisfying life without worrying and building wealth.  You need to be stable in the present before you can work on making your future stable
hmda0ob,ppardee,11/27/2021,1,You might want to get some counseling.  This sounds AWFULLY like obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Youre doing something you dont want to be doing and its causing you distress but not doing it causes you distress too.

hmaxdr0,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,> the more beneficial your investment will be    This isnt usually true for DCA. Lump sum investing beats DCA in terms of investment growth around 60% of the time meaning lump sum investing will be more beneficial in the long run *on average*. DCA though as you point out is about reducing volatility. It does reduce volatility but on average it returns less over the same amount of time as lump sum does.
hmbn850,Ok_Salary5884,11/27/2021,1,I was able to get ahold of my bank. They said this person spent money my card declined.

They aren’t sure if a refund is possible. I did get rid of my social I was able to find my birth certificate and hide it with that. As far as my money back. I don’t think it’s coming back. But that’s okay. Lesson learned.   Thank you so much for a really considerate and down to heart reply. It helped me coupe a bit.

hmcyzh2,WizardofOssification,11/27/2021,1,The EKG is covered but there is a lot of conflicting data on whether routine preventative EKGs do anything helpful in the absence of symptoms or specific risk factors.  But since they found a “problem” the echo will not qualify for preventative coding.   May be worth declining EKGs in the future for regular preventative things. Insurances may pay for it but not helpful clinically for screening if low risk and recommended against getting by the national preventative health body.   https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography
hmcz49j,not-now-im-redditing,11/27/2021,1,You need to get a full picture of your grandma’s assets and liabilities and income. That’s the starting point. You also need to obtain a copy of her husbands will and a list of assets that were co-owned including joint bank accounts.  You can pull your grandma’s credit report to get a starting point for identifying her debts.   It’s a lot of work but it’s doable once you are organized.  I don’t know anything about social security benefits for elderly widows. The pension may include a survivorship option that if elected may cover your grandma. It varies from pension to pension but the idea is that an individual gives up a small portion of their pension in exchange for surviving spouse benefit. You can probably call the company handling the pension and ask them about generalities if they won’t talk specially about your grandma. The name is probably included on a statement.

hm9da1d,radwagonier,11/27/2021,1,A few thoughts:  If you had instead inherited $300k cash would you have bought a big old house with that money? Probably not.   The upside is that a 24yo inherited a house instead of cash. Most 24yo’s who inherit that much cash end up living with a lot of regret.   One thing you could do is sell the house buy a small starter home in a place you’d like to live and spend the proceeds putting yourself through school to enter a lucrative career.   Do not buy the next house with your girlfriend. It’s your house.
hm9q8qb,GoatzQI,11/27/2021,1,Tell them the truth. You were in a rear end accident  and didn’t realize the damage was as bad as it is until further inspection at home. They will advise you as to what steps you need to take. Contrary to popular belief not all rear end accidents are the fault of the car in the rear. If it is deemed your fault then it could raise your rates. If she is at fault and her insurance covers the damage you should be fine.. Assuming she even has insurance. I’d definitely file an accident report if you can so that it is on record. A lot of places allow you to do this online.

Once they figure out you are under the miles or on pace to turn it in with much less miles than you paid for in the lease terms they will try all sorts of sleazy bullshit in order to get you to turn it in and not buy it out.

hma6v4a,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,> It would have been better for you to sign Provider B’s forms to allow a direct transfer of funds from A to B  You are describing a Direct Rollover.  There are a few ways Custodians can choose to execute Direct Rollovers.  One of those involves checks.  A check is issued from the Old Custodian that is payable to the New Custodian For Benefit Of (FBO) _c4rli3​.  This is a process that is not uncommonly encountered in the 401k/403b world.  OPs statement indicates that this was the method used.  >> check that would be addressed to the proper contact at Provider B.   Thus the 60 day rule does not apply in this case.  That rule is only for indirect rollovers where the check is made payable to _c4rli3.  > Why didn’t you send the check to Provider B yourself?  The process that OP has described is a normal one that can be expected from some HRs.  Some HRs have processes that require them to be the ones to submit/mail the rollover checks/forms to the custodian.  The problem here is not with the OP.
hmbx0r1,DrGreenMeme,11/27/2021,1,Why do you think I said “more than minimum wage” if I expected people who made minimum wage to meet these saving goals? Move it up to $15/hr whatever you’re splitting hairs. But also if you’re able to make it paycheck-to-paycheck on minimum wage or close to it working 40 hours you can absolutely find a way to save $100 extra a month. Even if that means delivering pizzas or mowing lawns for a couple extra days a month.
hmb8idr,arisaulrich,11/27/2021,1,Would it not be immediately accessible if held in a Roth IRA uninvested (basically a money market account)? I wouldnt be buying anything with the funds just parking them in the Roth to reserve the space. This would be a Charles Schwab Roth IRA alongside a Charles Schwab checking & savings account.  Thank you for your reply!
hmahatg,Calm_Cod_5266,11/27/2021,1,Right from what I can tell many ESG index funds are similar to market ETFs but just screen out oil and gas companies. Which I guess is good that it still tracks the market but doesn’t support a few companies that are bad for the environment. Doesn’t do much outside of that it appears. They do have ones with stricter guidelines but they are smaller funds with less history.   I do feel motivated to allocation at least a portion of my portfolio to ESG but trying to figure out the right mix. Thanks for sharing.

hmchjvv,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/27/2021,1,“Crashes” are natural and isn’t as bad as people make them out to be. Other than the 1929 crash no other crash has gone down more than 25%. The S&P averages about a 15% return every year. If you keep it in there for five years you’ll get a 75% return. If a “crash” happens you’re still up 50%. It’s basic simple math yet people think “crashes” are the end of the world.
hmcsz62,blablahblah,11/27/2021,1,Where does it say you have this debt? They should give you access to your full credit report so you can see what account has the outstanding balance.
hmca4o4,User3992,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for this answer! Youve definitely given me a couple different ways of looking at this.  I do have to keep in mind that a house is an investment and not a depreciating asset like pretty much everything else.  So Im not really losing the money I put into it aside from interest but in theory the house should gain in value to cover that.  My parents purchased their home in the same city about 30 years ago for $100k... it is likely worth close to $500k now.  I hadnt considered looking at this from the past to now.  Barring some major economic collapse I can see this trend continuing somewhat for the future.

hmcm6vw,whyamilikedis21312,11/27/2021,1,That makes me so happy 😭 $700-800 is more than possible I could easily find a place for this with a roomate. I also think because I’m so used to low spending my food bill will be way lower than the average person.   I’ll look into other cities because living alone would be awesome especially if I could spend less.
hmcs1tq,jethammerford,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for all of this information. Very very helpful. I’m still a bit confused. Do you know what he means by “come in Monday to do the paperwork” when I don’t have a vehicle that I’ve settled on? He’s been on the look out for a rav4 hybrid xle but before he told me to come in on Monday he told me that they are all sold out of all rav4s. (And that’s all within the same conversation.)
hmb4cj1,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,Simply getting married isnt expensive just a nominal fee for the paperwork at the courthouse.  Getting divorced can certainly be expensive though. Many people change drastically in their early to mid-20s.  Its not a reason to avoid marriage necessarily but certainly a factor you should consider. Make sure youre ready to get married in general. Money religion children family involvement where you want to live conflict resolution etc... the list goes on and all of it is important in a marriage.   Id recommend pre-marital counseling and taking it seriously. There are paid services like traditional counseling but you can also run through question lists online. Good ole Reddit supplies a decent list in the thread linked below. Sit down individually and write out your answers slowly and thoughtfully over the course of a few weeks. Then come together and compare your answers.

hm9ujv8,ihavereddit2021,11/27/2021,1,I would consider whether its really worth putting down 20%. Debt is still cheap in the mortgage market. An investment only needs to make ~3% to out pace your mortgage rate.  You could put down 5% keep the remaining ~$45k in your investments and likely make well over whatever youd save in mortgage interest.
hmcq20v,Eon_PNW,11/27/2021,1,But don’t banks take into account all debt? For example assuming all other things equal:  Person A: 20% down payment + 1k cc  Person B: 20% down payment + 1k cc + 30k student loans.   Wouldn’t the bank go with option A because less risk?
hmceap0,PM_ME_GLUTE_SPREAD,11/27/2021,1,To add to this “free weight exercises” is going to mean different things to different people.   Bench/squat/deadlifts are fun but if you’re looking to get into shape they aren’t needed. A PF is more than adequate equipment wise for the vast majority of people to get into shape.   Imo if you’re just starting out at going to a gym chose the cheapest option. Once there if you realize you want more find a gym that offers that. If you find out you still want more keep looking. PF is a fantastic start since they are cheap and have a lot of basic equipment.
hmatv8a,blacklassie,11/27/2021,1,Since you say you want to hire a management company you should look into the costs associated with that. Those costs can eat into your profit enough that renting may no longer look that attractive.
hmd2fex,jmainvi,11/27/2021,1,You say that houses are much nicer in the 275-285k range where youre at OP. Thats fine and thats good to know. You and your partner can sit down and have a decision about whether thats worth the extra mortgage payment.  The point at which it becomes lifestyle creep is when you and your partner decide ok our new budget is 280 lets start looking and then you suddenly start to realize that the houses are MUCH nicer than what youre now looking if you get in the 305-315k range.   There is always another step up. Make conscious decisions about whether its one thats worth taking.
hmaxcyi,Ok-Grapefruit-1072,11/27/2021,1,Trust me you will never find a reliable car for 3k. Youll find one on Craigslist for that much but it will be old high milage and penny you to death for repairs. 10k is a good amount to spend on a car. Keep it for as long as you can.  This situation sucks I have the same problem but with student loans and medical bills & dental bills. How many hours a week do you work? What is your monthly income? You might benefit from working PT in retail or fast food around your doordash gig and dedicate that money to your debt without sacrificing your income but I cant say %100 because I dont fully know your situation.

hmbfpga,cactushugger8,11/27/2021,1,Makes sense!
hmckc6y,myroommateisgarbage,11/27/2021,1,If you make minimum wage would it be an option to move to a smaller (and cheaper) city that isnt too far away and take a different minimum wage job?  The two options for you here are 1) find the cheapest living situation possible via roommates and 2) find a better paying job. I know the latter is not ideal for your situation.
hmcoj9p,baddad49,11/27/2021,1,im guessing with 18 months of employment it might be a good bit more than that but who knows? you may be in for a very nice surprise once you get the account setup done though...good luck to ya! :)
hmd9bcj,Brilliant_Guru843,11/27/2021,1,Or you can just buy United States I-Bonds from the treasury and get the 7.12% interest. Just have to keep them for at least a year
hmc4x8n,fnbr,11/27/2021,1,I have automatic payroll deductions set for investing. I raise that amount by a large fraction of whatever raise I get. So if my take home increases by $50 per paycheque I increase my automated investments by $30. So I still get a raise but my investments also get a raise.   This way I don’t have to feel guilty about spending the money in my chequing  account as I’ve already invested a reasonable amount.
hmd80h3,keller892,11/27/2021,1,I can see that pov but doesnt it boil down to OPs tolerance for risk and likelihood of lifestyle changes? For example if they might suddenly have to relocate for work or the housing market crashes or they plan to start a family. But without data from OP we spectators cant make a blanket call. A lot of ppl in 2007 thought they needed to get on the housing ladder at any cost overextended themselves and got badly burnt the following year. Given that pretty much all asset classes are overpriced right now despite a once in a lifetime pandemic that (omicron) may be about to kick our asses again I would remain cautious about big illiquid purchases of any kind. The primary argument against that is inflation of course.
hmcrb1b,LivelikeJune_2021,11/27/2021,1,I would say your asking the wrong question. Marriage is as expensive as you want it to be like life.  Divorces can also be expensive. That is awfully young to get married. But everyone is different. You and your future partner have to be on the same page. You should never pressure someone into marriage. If you marry right away will you be able to have your own place to live in. Stuff like this matters for the relationship. I thought I would get married earlier but we waited until he was 30 and I was 29 and we were more financially stable and could finally have our own place with no roomates. Most importantly if you do get married that young it would be great if you have parents that can help you because life is expensive and having support from family. Also pay attention to what your partners family is like they will be your family too. 💕

Remember this when you’re pinching those pennies because you might not ever get a chance to spend them on the life you wish you had.
hmajnkn,lcburgundy,11/27/2021,1,Review /r/scams before pursuing any further remote employment. Generally speaking all remote work positions should be assumed to be scams unless you can establish otherwise. No legitimate employer will ever send you thousands of dollars out of the blue for equipment.

hmc15bt,ratmouthlives,11/27/2021,1,Flip side is employer might have projects with key integral work being done by a key employee and don’t want issues if that key employees leaves and takes all their knowledge with them.   It’s still about making money of course but i think this reasonable… depending on the field and assignment.
hmclvd6,cownan,11/27/2021,1,Thanks! I appreciate it I may sell the family home if it turns out I dont move back. But it is generating a little income for me now and it feels like a big hit to give up my tentative plans and pay capital gains on the house when I dont have a strong reason. Who knows the housing market may crash too but from my memory of 2008 prices didnt really drop so much as stay frozen for almost a decade

hmd897k,Bostonosaurus,11/27/2021,1,Ive never heard of converting to a different loan. I think your primary residence mortgage typically states that you move in within 30-60 days of closing and live there for at least 12 months.  It may be in your advantage to live there for 24 months. That way if you sell within the subsequent 36 months (60 months from your move-in) you get a huge tax advantage if it increases in value and you decide to sell.  Ive asked similar questions to yours in the past and I didnt get much of an answer to: 1) Can I hold two mortgages at the same time? Are the terms similar? 2) Does rental income count in my debt to income ratio when getting the 2nd house (my new primary residence).  Im guessing holding two mortgages may be the biggest challenge to this plan but not knowing income and house costs its hard to say. If you make $1000000/yr have no debts and the houses are each 100k youll be fine. Beyond that Im not sure what numbers work as you already mentioned its kinda hard to Google. I DO believe that you will be required to have more money in cash assets when getting the 2nd mortgage in case the rental property is vacant.

hmcol6o,colterlovette,11/27/2021,1,I don’t know how this particular utility company works but if they didn’t do a meter check on account change-over that’s on them not you and that’s easily provable when they cite the prior meter reading that was taken under a different account as their starting reference.   They can’t prove the usage is yours in order to levy the charges. While sure you taking a picture would have made the logistics to resolution easier here it’d also be you doing their job.   I’d be calling them up daily and possibly including the state utility regulator consumer complaints office if I didn’t get it cleared up within a few days.  *edit* To clarify this is all data. Start date end date rate etc. if any of those parameters fall outside the time stamp on account creation they made a boo-boo and it’s on them to clear it up.

hma7qt9,ThisIsAMonere,11/27/2021,1,“I was under the assumption it’s better to save than pay off mortgage early.”  Spending money on a vacation isn’t “saving” and even it it was the assumption above is incorrect.  I think you meant to say “it’s better to *invest* than to pay off the house early.” This *can* be true but only if you’re committed to putting the money available to throw at the house payment into investments instead. You’ve clearly said you’re not doing that (you’re spending your extra $7000 a year on vacations not investments or savings.)  Anyways none of the above really matters. What matters is your values and priorities.  Right now you value your vacations *more* thank you value your retirement. That’s okay and it sounds like we won’t change your mind.  You just need to know that you are *choosing* to retire many years later than you otherwise could if you put some of that vacation money into retirement investments instead.  You also need to know that from one perspective the vacation it doesn’t really cost you $7000 it costs you the value of lost gains over the next 30-35 years as well. See example below:  Assuming you put that $7000 into investments instead every year you’d gain about $400000 in interest over the next 30 years.  So you’re choosing to *not earn* $400000 for the sake of these vacations. Again nothing wrong with that! You just need to know that over the course of the next 30 years these vacations cost you $400000 more than you are think you are paying.   Again and I’m going to sound like a broken record: This is a fine choice and there’s nothing wrong with valuing your vacations more than valuing your retirement.  Just know that in making that choice you’re choosing to work for however many years *longer* it will take you to retire since you’re not investing that money. (Perhaps you can retire at 75 instead of 60 due to prioritizing these vacations? You’d need to put it into a calculator to be sure.)
hmcsn0q,dendari,11/27/2021,1,That fee is way too high.a personal loan to cut interest rates isnt generally a great idea but if you arent going to rack up more debt it can be a good way to cut the amount of interest you pay( with a minor hit to you credit score).  If you want to do this you should be able to find a personal loan without any fee.

hma1lz1,wickedkittylitter,11/27/2021,1,Dont buy a house with a girlfriend.  Its messy when/if there is a breakup.  If you insist on going ahead with your plan use your first couple of months extra cash to pay a lawyer for a legal agreement detailing what happens to the house if there is a breakup.  You also need to specify how expenses will be handled while you live in the house.  Some points to include:  how maintenance costs will be split how any home improvement costs will be split how the monthly mortgage payment will be split who gets the house if you breakup a requirement that the loan be refinanced after the breakup within X amount of time or the house must be listed for sale at a reasonable price.  Your lawyer should have lots of other suggestions.  Its impossible to tell whether you should move into a higher price range because you havent listed any income or debt obligation information.  You also need to remember that houses come with more expenses than the mortgage payment.  Your utilities could be higher and more numerous than you are currently paying.  Youll need to buy lawn maintenance equipment and basic home maintenance equipment.  Youll need to occasionally replace/fix something like the water heater we had replaced last week.

hm9bmkz,PM_ME_YOUR_CALICOS,11/27/2021,3,This happens and it sucks that it happened to you.   If youre worried about them just doing this to switch the loan ask him how he messed up the miles. I knew our dealership finance manager well and it happened and he was the least malicious or sales-y finance guy Ive met. They are human beings and as such make mistakes which sucks when it happens to you but isnt malicious.  We had people type the miles in and I know of one sake where it was typed in like 53000 and the car had 56000. We caught it and resubmitted the deal before they signed but I know the bank bumped it from like 2.14% to 2.19%.  Any finance manager worth a damn would not risk unraveling a sale to get whatever the commission difference may be. If he wanted to shop this to banks the time was before you signed. Id chalk this up to be a genuine mistake.
hmd6unu,Anddrol,11/27/2021,1,Then even if they ask which there should be absolutely zero reason for them to know about it you can easily explain everything and should be good to go. But seriously at this point her mortgage coming out of a different account that doesn’t have your name on it might as well be a strangers 😂 you should be just fine! Hope you find exactly the place you want.

hmd2q3h,Pie4mePie4u,11/27/2021,1,You should be taking that advanced CTC and paying down your debt since it wasn’t something that was figured in your monthly budget to begin with
hmcodi4,KReddit934,11/27/2021,1,Thanks Ill look at that then.

hmba05x,kevinmci307,11/27/2021,1,Pay your debt off.   I’m a believer in crypto but you never know it could go down 80%. And then you’re in a much worse spot. Pay your debt off and you’ll still have plenty of crypto exposure.
hmcezac,brdblkguy,11/27/2021,1,All I can say is go with your gut feeling the boss/training. I have been in a couple positions where I had been told to train people and after the training manual was complete and I got some experience training people I was let go. To me it seems weird for your boss to find your resume online like it wont be there anyway. I assumed yall talked about issues you are having since they are offering to pay for courses for you and such. Go with your gut. Me personally Id probably start the process of leaving.

hmc1p5x,UpperMaintenance5108,11/27/2021,1,I live in a super hot market and if you can’t put AT LEAST 20% down plus probably extra over asking price you will never get accepted.
hmcz43h,phoenixmatrix,11/27/2021,1,Weddings can be cheap. Just dont give in to the peer pressure of the family who will want you to invite 400 people and go over the time. Its your day not theirs. Im fairly well off and we still spend less than 1 month worth of income on our wedding and easily could have spent much much less.     As for finances getting mixed since youre really young you may want to sign a prenup agreement. You dont know if one of you may hit it off and become wildly more successful than the other. Then since people change maybe things dont work out and now one of you get completely screwed (this will depend on the laws of the state youre in of course). It may not be the most romantic thing in the world but IMO its the responsible thing to do.     Do consider having separate accounts so you can keep some level of financial independence. Not only will it make it easier to get out if things go to hell but it also makes it a lot easier to hide birthday presents )     Then if you want a joint account on top of that make it clear ahead of time how much of your incomes will go in it vs how much you keep for yourself.
hma4vpp,badlero,11/27/2021,1,The landlord hasn’t just noticed now. The OP says the landlord has been asking for the money since early this year.   I’m honestly surprised the landlord has been letting this continue this long. With the bank not being able to confirm the money has been paid it’s obviously the bank’s error since banks track all money leaving and entering. Cash paper checks echecks wire transfers bill pay doesn’t matter. It’s tracked and has confirmation numbers for every step of the way.   Pinky promises that a checked cashed is a great cause of concern and points to who fucked up. Now they aren’t willing to make it right with the landlord so the OP needs to while fighting to get the money from their bank.
hmbjpew,cosmos7,11/27/2021,1,I dont understand that at all... sounds like complete bullshit.  For a simple estate there is no need for an estate lawyer and thus no real fees to speak of.  Simple deed transfer doesnt cost $4k even if you have some other party do it for you.  If there is an estate lawyer involved for some reason neither OP nor the other parties involved are obligated to pay them.  Its dependent upon the locale but is generally limited to a percentage of the estate and should not be $4k for a property only worth $5k.  If they want money they have to collect from the estate anyway... I would just walk away at that point.
hma23al,taurusfeeling,11/27/2021,1,What’s wrong w them?
hmcwbss,yellowcanvas,11/27/2021,1,this is a very good point thank you!
hmcc11h,startrektoheck,11/27/2021,1,Pay attention to this guy. An increase in salary can easily be offset by lower retirement contributions and higher medical expenses. Add up *everything* and make sure your new job beats it if l you’re changing jobs primarily for more money.
hmcrqs4,Appropriate-Yam-1160,11/27/2021,1,I do risk management consulting for banks.
hmd4pfz,Duffmanlager,11/27/2021,1,That is true. Gotta make sure you also get an owner’s policy for the little extra.
hmbgm6m,Ferret_Faama,11/27/2021,1,This is something people always vastly underestimate. There are so many random expenses that it always costs more than you can easily account for on paper.
hmbqz87,MDfoodie,11/27/2021,1,^ this is a great point. By avoiding the situation entirely you remove the chance that things get nasty *when* she messes up due to inexperience.
hmd8guu,feistyfeline483,11/27/2021,1,Good idea -- the main call out that I think will be really helpful is if the utility company did not physically come out to read the meter once you opened the utility account in your name as the new owner. My guess is that this is typically their policy and someone got lazy or it now needs to be added to their policy for opening accounts. They know they have no leverage with the old owner because that person likely already paid their final bill and fully closed their account.   I really cant imagine how they can try to make you pay this since this really seems to their fault unless they have fine print about this on anything you signed.  Also you may want to mention reaching out to the utility commissioners office to ensure they dont shut off your service while you look into this. If that doesnt work Im sure there are some city officials you could call/email and worse case reach out to the utility companies executive team on LinkedIn.
hmbg6cb,Mayor__Defacto,11/27/2021,1,With scheduling you don’t really need it to be processed instantly. Plus it allows for transaction reversal where instant processing would leave people with less recourse.  RTPs do exist in parallel also processed by the ACH system. But it isn’t just banks - it’s also because of the way companies operate too. Most companies prefer batch processing because it allows them to review all the transactions for the day to approve the disbursements all at once. Additionally companies prefer to get paid as soon as possible but pay vendors as late as possible.
hmc30rt,clooneh,11/27/2021,1,It would make more sense yes but its not beyond believability especially if youre excited for a new job and arent trying to stir the pot
hmbhcaj,LooksAtClouds,11/27/2021,1,Why would it cost that much to do that? If OP buys the land from the estate wouldnt it be a rather simple transaction?
hmcrfah,just-another-lurker,11/27/2021,1,Some couples combine income and some couples keep it mostly separate. I dont think there is a right way or wrong way to do it. Whatever works for their relationship.

hmc7sho,Peelboy,11/27/2021,1,How many shares of each and can you have been selling CC on them? Even if it is a little at a time I makes a big difference.  This may not be the way to go for you but if you are thinking of selling anyways what can it hurt to be paid to sell.
hmdate4,Critical-Cell-3064,11/27/2021,1,Yes it’s 0.5%. You can also get double for 3 months when you refer someone (the person you refer gets double as well for three months. By double I mean an extra 0.5APY.  I am not sure what other options you looked at but this is what I use and it works for me.

hmcsp15,hsc_mcmlxxxvii,11/27/2021,1,The echo only rules out a major structural problem or wall motion abnormality.

hmd5wi6,Technical_Touch_4676,11/27/2021,1,This is 100% illegal the only way it would is if they paid the entire years salary and were asking for the rest of it back. I assume she was payed weekly or so. Reach out send emails go speak to the boss in person. But most importantly if they keep pushing go get a lawyer even right now this is probably something you could sue over.
hmamoqx,el_rico_pavo_real,11/27/2021,1,Ok so DCA is nothing more than the average price paid over the course of the investment. Makes sense. I always thought of it as the strategy itself.... buy a little here buy a little there and not concern too much with lowest entries possible. Thanks for the insight!
hmd2fqt,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1,Ask for credit limit increase and apply for a 2nd card. Most banks only report your statement balance to your credit reports once a month. Dont stress too much because past balances arent factored into your credit scores. However in the short term if your reported balance exceeds 10-20% of your credit limit its going to start dropping your credit scores.  Read these:  https://www.asksebby.com/blog/how-to-aggressively-increase-your-credit-score-short-term-strategy  https://www.asksebby.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-credit-score-long-term-as-a-millennial
hm8vc86,heavy_metal_20,11/27/2021,96,Right?! Its frankly embarrassing to see what people are begging donations for these days. No sorry Im not interested in funding your second vacation to Germany though Id love to go too.  If you agree this sentiment [please consider chipping in $50 or $100 to my GoFundMe here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) - were climbing Kilimanjaro next summer and you can help give us the greatest experience of our lifetime!
hmbngme,6BigAl9,11/27/2021,1,Its very easy to get quotes from multiple providers online. Geico Progressive State Farm etc. there are plenty of options. Just make sure you are comparing similar coverages.
hmd0oxm,the1gofer,11/27/2021,1,Yes you’ll just have to provide different docs.  Talk to a broker.
hmcnrnx,rivervalism,11/27/2021,1,A friend of mine had a lot of trouble bringing a new out of state car to CA (but this was a long time ago). They seem to assume you are trying to avoid tax and emissions restrictions. At a minimum you should be sure the car is legal to buy in CA. I would personally wait and get it in CA or buy used.
hmb0qzx,Layne205,11/27/2021,1,A trust inherited it. To transfer it to any single person would cost money. If the trust keeps it they cant close the trust.
hmcnd64,colterlovette,11/27/2021,1,Interest is somewhat irrelevant if you can pay it off faster (I.e. just start throwing cash at the balances as fast as you can).   In my experiences consolidation loans are typically a PIA have terrible interest rates themselves and leave a nice dark mark on the credit history for any future underwriting agent.   Some may have differing opinions but unless a typical retail bank is willing to lend you a personal line you’re better off trimming the budget to the bones and getting these paid off asap.   The exception to this is if you have some asset of value you can loan against.   Most likely: buckle down get it paid off.
hmcu4z2,series_hybrid,11/27/2021,1,Imagine you buy the car under those circumstances. Then...a week later they contact you saying that they discovered the lie and now you dont qualify for the financing they promised so they are offering you a much higher interest rate.  The car has a week of miles on it and can no longer be sold as new so you would be liable for the lost value plus you still need a car and the down payment money is gone.  Do you like being taken advantage of by unscrupulous scammers?
hmd6gwx,tobesteve,11/27/2021,1,Probably a dumb question but if were taking traditional IRA or Roth IRA it doesnt matter right? Theres no offsetting gains with losses?
hm9rv6f,yut777_,11/27/2021,1,Am aware of this and its kinda why Im considering changing jobs to get a healthier job environment
hmbu48d,SuchLovelyLilacs,11/27/2021,1,> it will sound weird but part of the reason we feel we last is that we both are capable of walking away from the relationship.  This doesnt sound weird to me at all. Ive told my husband I love you but I dont need you and I think he feels the same about me. We both stay because we want to stay not because we have to.
hmd6c3x,6AMDxGMxCrypto9,11/27/2021,1,Yes Im sure an Investopedia link can describe in detail. I was a CS for Invesco (shittiest place to work don’t do it) when we had 403b account holders contact us to make a withdraw we had to relay to the client that they have to fill out a paper form get it notarized then get the TPA or plan admin to sign off the forms send it all back to us and proceed as soon as we confirm docs.   The TPA/Plan Admin has authority to not allow a clients request for withdrawal for any reason termination is practically the only way YOU can initiate a for sure yes on your end. Though it still requires the participation of the company so if you leave on bad terms be prepared to wait for weeks after having to go another route that requires more paperwork.

hmbnuso,Hiddencamper,11/27/2021,1,Call your insurance company and see if you can submit a claim for the services. The insurance company may be able to just cut you a check.  You could talk to the dr office billing as well. But since you already paid they may have the account settled in their system.   You should be eligible to claim this either though the dr office or directly.
hmb4a83,reyrey1332,11/27/2021,1,Are you serious about it growing in the bank???  Youre actually losing money when you count for inflation.
hmade4x,MathandMarketsCFA,11/27/2021,1,Had to edit this as I replied to the wrong person at first however it doesnt matter what type of fund it is. Its about sharpe not ex-ante return expectations everyone wants to avoid vol if they can.
hmatkrr,lainey822,11/27/2021,1,Why wouldnt it be possible to rent cheap? Perhaps getting roommates to lower down the cost? Perhaps that person who lives in a high cost area cant afford it? All the things I said are all common sense.  And you said it is not possible for everyone and perhaps those people are not willing to sacrifice to cut cost. But I do understand building wealth is not for everyone...only for the few who understand what it takes.
hmbvvvt,PickleJuice_DrPepper,11/27/2021,1,Unless it’s different in different states generally the seller pays the realtor fees right? You wouldn’t be the one spending the money.
hmd259x,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,You want the traditional 4-5 year hardship program that theyve had forever.   You wont find much Covid help.

hmd4s7r,kindrudekid,11/27/2021,1,Why run the credit check ? I mean I get it its interest free.  Most credit card companies are getting in on the buy now pay later schemes like afterpay and affirm but integrated into their credit card statement for individual purchases.  Chase has My Plan and Amex has Plan It..and most of them are offering 0% fee till end of the year. I just bought a new house and almost all my purchases have gone on my amex with 24 month plan setup. I get great amex support and amex points which are much more useful to me.    They even run promotion lower rates. Basically its prepaid interest.
hmd4rrg,impressive_specimen,11/27/2021,1,Not really at the point of being able to invest dont know nearly enough to pull it off. Just need to have a local account and not sure which of these offers is the better deal.
hmc9cm5,moopuppy1995,11/27/2021,1,I am so with you! We have a joint credit card and a joint bank account that we each give a percentage of our income to and then everything else is separate. Rent groceries insurance and anything that is for the both of us goes on the joint account. Anything else is separate. I definitely would not be okay with having one account between the both. Way too risky and also I want to pay for my own things and want him to pay for his own things.
hm9rfze,OldGrady,11/27/2021,1,I was able to get a Signature Guarantee on form 5444 from Bank of American.  Don’t try for a medallion stamp they are much more difficult to obtain.
hmbmik0,formerprincess,11/27/2021,1,Have you seen your actual insurance bill? Or are you paying your father $250 because he told you that was the cost?  The rate for your share should be itemized on the bill.   When you know that amount you can get quotes from other companies to see if it is reasonable.  You will probably pay more to be on your own policy. However if the other cars on your fathers policy are flashy you could be paying too much.
hmbh74b,ApatheticAbsurdist,11/27/2021,1,Buy the house after youre married. It will be a lot cleaner legally. If you want to do it before the wedding one person buys the other pays rent equal to half the mortgage once married it will become shared property.  Two areas to focus on with your extra money: 1) downpayment for the house and 2) retirement investments. 3) Debt   Roth is ok but youre getting up there in salary to the point where the benefits might not be as good as they were when you were making less. But it doesnt hurt to diversify. Either adding more money to your 401k or your Roth wouldnt be bad. But if youre buying a house prioritizing socking money away in a high yield savings account wouldnt be a bad option in the interim.  If all your debt is below 5% it probably makes sense to pay those down at minimum payments as your retirement and house investments will probably outpace that debt. If you have debt with 7% or higher interest pay those down faster.  The higher your downpayment the better your options are and the lower your monthly payments will be (because of reduced principle and interest/PMI). Waiting til closer to your wedding to purchase might be good. The housing market is also a bit crazy right now so if renting lets you save more you could end up with something better a little down the road.
hma4c3g,Annonymouse100,11/27/2021,1,Yep you are just going to have to do the math based on your two potential properties using one as a rental and paying interesting on that amount of unrealized equity on your new home. Don’t forget the hassle of maintenance/ being a landlord (does you current home have large expenses coming up in the next 5-10 years?) and future capital gains on the eventual sale of the rental. No one is going to be able to give you a standard formula as there are to many variables based on the properties.   California also has a few base year transfer options for those over 55 disabled effected by natural disasters etc.

hmcdhnm,brawlrats,11/27/2021,1,Yes they likely need to make a corrective contribution.  Tell them you’ll contact the DOL if they don’t get a attorney familiar with employee benefits involved to straighten out the situation ASAP.  It will be much better for them to self-correct than have the DOL get involved.
hmcmv0z,o2msc,11/27/2021,1,Just put your money in an S&P500 or Total US Market Index Fund and save yourself the stress and likely losses. Just set it and forget it - ride the market.

hmd1s38,inkseep1,11/27/2021,1,Since the prior owner had estimated readings that were never adjusted with an actual reading it will take some time to sort it out.  But they will.  There will be a way that they do this that is permitted within the regulations.   No one will be 100% sure that you get charged correctly for your usage down to the dollar but it should be close enough.  Probably what they will do is just prorate the unbilled usage for the time you owned it.  If it is a good system they will figure it based on the season and the average heating / cooling degree days over that time.  I guarantee that they have done this before.    Dont pay the bill yet.  At least here and I would assume other places the investigation will halt the shut off.   They cant shut off everyone because they dont have enough employees.  Cut offs are done on a scoring system involving amount owed the length of time that you are behind on payments new usage and other things.  If you just now got a notice you are probably still scoring low in the routing system that sends the field crew out.  They are not ever going to tell you that because the threat of cut off is supposed to make you pay.   And the investigation should automatically halt the routing.  That is how I designed ours to work.    However utility payment reports might affect your credit rating.  So if you do pay it simply request a refund.   Or you can also call them and complain that not paying should not appear as a negative on their reports.     Do you know what utility companies hate the most?   Customer calls.  The call center costs money and does not generate any revenue.   Probably the second most hated thing is Public Service Commission complaints.  File one of them and they will have to provide the PSC tedious documents to resolve it.    But give it most of a billing cycle for them to sort it out.
hmd4p1s,Varathien,11/27/2021,1,VTSAX gives you pretty much every American stock.   VTIAX gives you pretty much every international stock.   Thats all you need as a young person.   Once youre closer to retirement youll probably want to add some VBTLX for bonds.
hmbuyia,lizgross144,11/27/2021,1,We have both. For us the HYSA is the money we don’t plan to touch without a well thought-out decision (our emergency fund). There are smaller balances in LYSAs for vacation savings short-term savings etc. It works for us.

hm9up58,lala614,11/27/2021,1,Was in a similar situation with a parent. I opened him a traditional IRA since he won’t really be earning more than now. Maxed it out at 7K and he will be doing this going forward. Made him a budget for this. Put some of his  other savings in a an I-Bond (though know it can’t be touched for at least a year). Lowered/negotiated some bills like phone internet and car insurance. And looked into his social security savings situation to see what that will look like. There’s a website where you can login and see how much you’ve been saving for retirement there super important to review in case of mistakes!

hm9jcpm,PersonalBrowser,11/27/2021,1,It’s not a big hassle at all just takes a week or so to get the new card. That being said if their credit card is ripped off it’s not a big deal as long as they actually check their statement every day or week or billing month to make sure all the charges are authorized. The whole point of a credit card is that if the card is stolen and used you aren’t liable.
hmd94b8,Darigaazrgb,11/27/2021,1,Its meant to be that way. I finally got health insurance after not having it for like 10 years. Before when I went to the doctor without insurance it was $120 flat fee paid in advance. I just got the bill for my first doctor visit to the same doctor I have been seeing and they billed my insurance company almost $500 of which they negotiated to only paying $170 and me paying $30 for a total of $200.

hmcupnn,Bryan995,11/27/2021,1,What’s your outlook on salary look like? Maxed out? Or can you get to 600k in 5-10 years? If room to grow then enjoy it. Go big! You would still be saving plenty. I value a home / apartment quite high since you can spend 60-100% of your time there.  Value per dollar is high.
hmcbz2c,Tough-Case-3836,11/27/2021,1,Chances are you really don’t know what you’re doing but walk the plank and do it. Good luck
hmbx065,j-christopher,11/27/2021,1,No one cares about inquiries and they barely impact your scores (if at all).  The more significant score factor would be the new account reporting which will lower the average age of accounts.  This may also be a non-factor if one has a deep long credit history.
hmbk8m9,CommiePatrol83,11/27/2021,1,Its not much but I think I can help here give me the land and Ill figure out what to do
hmcwp8m,daviongray,11/27/2021,1,Why 5-10 years? You can buy a house with as little as 3% down. No need to wait that long.
hmccqbg,Daredizzle,11/27/2021,1,Remember thats the minimum youll pay each month. When you rent its the maximum.
hmcwlrq,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,It is an attempt to measure how risky it is for banks to lend to you. On your end it can determine which loans and credit cards youre eligible for.  >Why is it bad to have a low credit score  Better scores have more and better options available to them. Great scores can get auto loans at 2% or less APR while poor scores may be facing 15%+.  >does it stop you from being able to buy things?  It can make getting auto loans and mortgages either impossible or with worse rates and/or terms.  Some employers also check credit as part of the hiring process. Edit: Also bad credit may exclude you from some apartment leases.
hmbrp70,93195,11/27/2021,1,FICO.    But if someone asks you feel free to use whichever one best suits the message you want to convey as either answer is true.  Most people don’t even know there is more than one anyway (there’s actually at least 10 scores including different FICO models - I think they’re up to about FICO 10 now).
hmcta2p,vtlatria,11/27/2021,1,This. Your score takes into account your overall revolving utilization not a cards utilization.   If you used the balance transfer to pay off an installment account it *might* negatively affect your score - if you actually transferred another credit card balance it should have no effect.   Reducing interest paid and being able to pay down debt more quickly is worth a temporary hit to your score unless you need to pull your credit for mortgage rental or auto application in the near future.
hmacgw4,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Regarding why it is in your name.   Reminder there are some folks who cash the check pocket the money and never get the damage fixed. Thats an OK thing to do.  Or maybe you take it somewhere cheaper and then pocket the difference.  The insurance reimbursed you for the value of the damage. You are under no requirement to actually go through with the repairs.  Anyway... They write the check to you so you can have control over all the above.
hmd62j7,bigpun32,11/27/2021,1,What was going through your head that made you think wiring $3000 outbound was a good idea?
hm8vuof,TooMello27,11/27/2021,2,100%   I bought the awd like you want to do bc iv always wanted it bc im in WNY.   B4 my awd I had a fwd that I bought snows tires for.   The snow tires on the fwd out do the awd in every way.   Awd and snow tires is the absolute king. economically speaking if I coukd go back Id stick with my more fuel efficient fwd with snow tires. It handled better and was better on gas  Ill be going back to fwd and snows after Im done with my current awd without a doubt.  Admittedly I really just wanted to mess around and do doughnuts with the awd lol

hmas7in,R0cketdevil,11/27/2021,1,Please consider this the land may not have much financial value today but wetlands are some of the most valuable carbon sinks in the northern hemisphere.   On top of that theyre an increasingly rare environment which makes them more important for biodiversity. Direct ownership of land is one of the most powerful tools for conservationists
hmbiiqx,Blah12821,11/27/2021,1,You should adjust your W-4 if it’s a job you are keeping. Better to do it now and allow time for processing. It’s better to take care of it sooner rather than later so you don’t forget about it.

hm8z883,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,GMAC is General Motors Acceptance Corporation now Ally Financial.   They appear to have turned a debt you owed over to a collection agency. Did you maybe not make a complete last payment?
hmbytuk,BastidChimp,11/27/2021,1,Start by prepping your own meals. Use only no annual fee credit cards that offer points or cash back. Use them ONLY for essential purchases like food and gas. Pay off the balance EVERY month. I use the Chase Ink Biz Cash card. Its a no annual fee credit card that offers 5x points for internet cable and cellphone bills. It also offers 2x points for dining and gas purchases. There are YT videos on how to apply for this specific card. Ask your employer if they are willing to help pay for your grad school tuition. Some businesses have programs like this for employees.
hmcn7sy,Pelian_Pines,11/27/2021,1,Some deductions do not double if you get married (the SALT deduction for one). The one I see affecting young people the most is the student loan interest deduction. If both people were deducting the max getting married will cut that in half. Also if one person was itemizing and the other was taking the standard deduction their joint return will have a smaller combined deduction. Higher income couples can also run into some issues with investment income tax brackets (which do not double) etc.
hmbqpiq,93195,11/27/2021,1,New credit and hard inquiry will ding your credit a bit.  I literally just did this at Macy’s a month ago when the wife bought about $500 worth of stuff.  Anything less than $100 in savings I wouldn’t have done it.  My FICO score just updated and took a 13 point hit.  No big deal it’ll come back I had that and more to give but if you need “real” credit soon and are desperate to improve your score realize that doing this will ding it a bit short term.
hma83oz,DeluxeXL,11/27/2021,1,[Ubiquity](https://www.myubiquity.com/401k-resources/rolling-over-your-401k-follow-these-steps/) isnt a plan custodian. It uses Charles Schwab Matrix or TD Ameritrade to actually hold the funds. Thus you would have the rollover check payable to one of these.  401k is a complex machinery behind the scenes where administering holding paperworking/compliance can all be outsourced to different companies. If you are interested here are a few articles to explain the differences:  * https://blog.investbcm.com/dna-of-a-401k-plan/  * https://401ktv.com/difference-record-keeper-third-party-administrator/
hmbdh9u,CQME,11/27/2021,1,I dont have experience with these but I understand the concept and what the super wealthy do with these kind of positions - they borrow off them and use loans to pay for things so that 1) they dont have to pay any capital gains tax and 2) they can still fully participate in their companys hopefully bright future.  In fact they could probably write off the interest if set up to do so and offset income.  Depending upon how much you have a wealth manager at a big bank could probably get you started or at least familiarized with how your situation works no commitment necessary for a consult.
hmconka,michaelcheck12,11/27/2021,1,So I was able to drop my PMI a few years back. You can pay extra to begin with but I recommend something else.  What I did was to take advantage of the growth in value of my house/land over a few years while paying extra on the principal. I was able to also invest extra money I had.  When I talked to the bank about dropping the PMI because I made a reasonable estimate that a new appraisal would show that the house/land was worth more than it was when I purchased it they required an appraisal.  I paid for the appraisal couple hundred bucks and it came out higher than I expected. I spent less money in additional principal payments because of this. Also because I wasnt only focusing on paying down the principal I was able to invest a lot in my retirement account as well.  With the way the real estate market is nowadays you may be just as lucky as I was.
hmcooh0,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,It will be weird when your investments yearly compounded earnings make more than your yearly salary!
hm9746z,vgacolor,11/27/2021,5,For everyone else. Learn this lesson from OP. Employers have their payroll online and once you leave their job access is cut off. Before you give notice go in there and download the last paystub.  It might not be complete since you are probably going to get one more but it will give you an idea and help you reconcile.    Do this in case they let you go immediately if you give notice. And if they dont let you go and you have access until the real last payment is made then download the updated one.
hma028g,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,Thank you so much! Ill check it out.
hm9icbp,decaturbob,11/27/2021,1, - nope and again employers can set their own standards if they are more stringent than federal or state. Where I worked hourly everything over 8hrs in a day and over 40hrs in a week was 1.5OT and Sundays/holidays was 2OT ( hoiliday pay not included)
hm9ftub,Desert-Mouse,11/27/2021,2,Thanks. Im in a similar boat. By the time my kids would be going to university I should be retired unless things dont go as planned by a long shot. Appreciate the share.
hm9yg63,ghostrecon11,11/27/2021,1,I’m going to burn bridges with the new employer if I decide to stay which is not great
hmc98ez,HairyWizard2,11/27/2021,1,I was trying to set up GoodBudget but my issue with that one is Im trying to budget each month by using my first paycheck for the first half and my second paycheck for the second half but I dont see a way to do that. They have a twice a month budget but not a way to out some expenses on the first half and other expenses on the other and share others. Like I want to put bills that are due before the 15th into one 2 week budget and everything after the 15th on the other plus add variable stuff like groceries gas and others on both. Maybe Im making it too complicated and I need to rethink how I want to structure my budget but I get paid every 2 weeks and want to budget so that everything is covered by those 2 then 2 months out of the year well have bonus checks that we can use for paying off debt or just using for whatever we want.
hmc4af2,pr1ncesspeaxh,11/27/2021,1,i plan to use it sparingly. do you have any advice for building perfect credit though? like 800+? i’m sure plenty of people use their credit cards responsibly like this but i’ve heard everywhere that perfect credit is really hard to get. but it seems so easy to stick to using it a small amount so what’s the big deal?
hmd11s0,brainiac2025,11/27/2021,1,This is an idiotic take. A echo shouldnt be $700 to begin with so yeah Id say it is a case of being screwed on that front. However even if you ignore that people shouldnt have to pore over the fine print of their insurance coverage to find out that a diagnostic test that a doctor is performing at a wellness check is not considered preventative.
hma50bu,Signal_Icy,11/27/2021,1,Papers would actually be expensive lmao I can prolly find a cheap reading tablet I don’t know what u call it but of course I wanted to ask advice first
hmbg9fn,Liu1845,11/27/2021,1,You should have gotten an EOB (explanation of benefits) from your insurance showing the doctors office charges what the insurance paid and how much you owe yourself. If you didnt get this call your insurance. Many have websites you can check this on. Then take your EOB and proof of what you paid to the doctors office to show them. They should be able to get you a check within 30 days. Only give the doctors office copies keep your originals.
hmaw9g4,ooglieguy0211,11/27/2021,1,Not all tow yards and Id love to see your source on that. There are deffinately scummy predatory tow companies out there but putting them all inder the same umbrella is pretty crappy.
hmc8blw,Default87,11/27/2021,1,you can refinance but it will still be considered an investment property.  that typically requires a higher than normal equity position (typically 20-25% which you have here so this isnt an issue) and typically comes with a higher interest rate (generally 0.5-1.0% higher than owner occupied mortgages).  so if you currently have 4.125% and given current prevailing market rates you may not be able to see any interest savings here at this time.  once you move back in and it is once again an owner occupied property you could look at refinancing and see if you have get a better rate then.
hmbw9i2,o2msc,11/27/2021,1,Buy a house when you are ready to buy a house not when “friends” graduate. Also don’t rent to said friends. Bad idea. Also don’t depend on rental income to pay the mortgage. If you can’t afford it without renters you can’t afford it.

hmcj4f8,BastidChimp,11/27/2021,1,If you invest in a chin up bar and gymnast rings you dont need to spend $30 a month for gym fees. There are excellent bodyweight workouts you can view on YouTube. Trust me you would be surprised at how many people cannot do bodyweight exercises let alone using free weights. Besides there are no covid restrictions in your own home.
hmcwrwy,Environmental_Put_33,11/27/2021,1,It is a number that proves to the bank you are a dedicated borrower that pays his debts on time. Higher the score usually means more money over a longer period of time was borrowed and repaid. For an average person it determines a lot more than you would think. From being able to finance a car rent an apartment buy a home insure a car and in some cases obtain certain jobs.
hmcmi2p,proteinfatfiber,11/27/2021,1,My husband and I bought our first home less than 3 years ago. We wanted to do the homestead thing but also worked so we bought a home on 2.5 acres less than an hour from 3 metro areas (one major city two regional cities). We got stupid lucky - were now selling and just accepted an offer for almost 200k (44%) more than we paid. With covid people are wanting more space and working from home more so commute is less of a concern so youre likely to have a bigger value raise in a more rural area near a big metro area. That said you cant predict the future and prices are currently through the roof so buy what you can afford and want to live in.
hmd33mf,Careful_Strain,11/27/2021,1,Lifeprotips. Go for annual checkup the week before your companys open enrollment. If they find anything that needs further testing change your plan from HDHP to PPO then schedule it for next year.
hma1efb,Chess01,11/27/2021,1,These guys were most likely just after your money that’s all.  The biggest risk is then selling your personal information.  It’s one of the oldest scams in the book.  They ask you to deposit a bad check them wire them the difference.  You wire the money and then the check bounces and you’re left with nothing while having lost whatever was wire transferred.
hm9ajpm,Phillip_Jae_Fry,11/27/2021,2,Yep. Specifically its called debit resequencing. Banks have lost multiple lawsuits in the past and yet still engage in this practice. I would suggest that those affected look into Ally Bank. Not only have they never engaged in this practice they recently announced that theyve [eliminated all overdraft fees on their accounts.](https://www.ally.com/overdraft/)
hmblf8d,quelindolio,11/27/2021,1,This. My dad worked as a retail pharmacist for decades because it pays the most. He got so sick of it that he took a cut in pay to go to a mail order pharmacy. That place had its own issues but no more screaming customers was much better for him. He ultimately switched back to hospital pharmacy because it was much more interesting. There are many other pharm tech options. It’s an in-demand skill.
hmbl9qw,thememeconnoisseurig,11/27/2021,1,There is a difference but for my purposes they have identical uses.  Frankly they are so similar I cant quite remember the differences. I believe ETFs are traded like stocks and index/mutual funds have SLIGHTLY different terms.  I suggest googling it to find the exact differences if youre curious.
hmb0qh3,lolaya,11/27/2021,1,Height isnt an issue. Just be fit
hmctplw,Useful-ldiot,11/27/2021,1,Im not op but I do something similar so maybe I can way in.  Yes the percentage direct to 401k means a raise equals more savings. But I also contribute a set amount to my seperate investment account. That number is a set amount per month that auto transfers from my back. When I get a raise I increase the dollar amount
hm9ny2n,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,It’s not?
hmchdmh,TakeYouOnAJourney8,11/27/2021,1,Here’s a good use of a raise in this situation depending on where you live you may have the no expiration on gift cards clause.  If that’s the case you can invest small amounts into gift cards for a place you will likely buy your furniture from so that it can bought outright without the added expense of an APR for financing.  It’s not the same as investing but it is an investment to save from lump sum payments in the future or financing fees.  Consider getting a investment portfolio up and going otherwise that’s more tailored to your comfort zone for investments.
hmbjr3b,footballer2323,11/27/2021,1,Its divorce thats expensive.  If you are going to get married and *stay* married (everyone thinks they will) then marriage can be a big boost to your finances.  If you married too young or married in haste and reconsider then you will have to get divorced and that will be a financial disaster.  Dont get married unless you are *sure* this is what you want for the rest of your life.

hmcunom,dleskov,11/27/2021,1,Oh yeah I am totally with you on your second paragraph.  And yes money cannot buy an infinite amount of time just like it cannot buy an infinite amount of land gold or Bitcoin. But I still hold on to my opinion that stating it cannot buy time at all is not perfectly correct.
hmcdsvw,Ameteur_Professional,11/27/2021,1,Its worth noting that in some states you may have entered a common law marriage without realizing it.
hmb227o,Fish-Weekly,11/27/2021,1,Are you sure it was a friend? It’s not necessary for someone to take pictures of your card to get a hold of your account numbers. This type of thing happens all the time. It’s also not necessary for them to have your SSN to post a fraudulent charge to your card.  As others have said call your bank (the number on the back of the card that was compromised). Tell them there is a fraudulent charge on the card for a purchase you did not make. They will investigate and almost certainly return your money.

hmd84v8,kilonad,11/27/2021,1,Circle A does this. Its all above board.
hmcmr45,myroommateisgarbage,11/27/2021,1,Yes!

hmdanys,Anonymoose2021,11/27/2021,1,AMT calculations are not always obvious.   You have to run your taxes both ordinary and AMT method to see of AMT is higher.   With $72k income your ordinary tax rate is not very high so you wont be able to exercise a lot of the stock without having to pay extra tax.   Definitely OK at 500 shares maybe 1000 but there isnt any shortcut.  You have to do a mock tax return both ways to see how much you can exercise without additional tax.
hmczide,nothlit,11/27/2021,1,Its a classic scam that relies on people thinking that funds available means check cleared. The check is fake or fraudulent. The receiving bank makes the funds available after a few days as required by law but the check itself can still bounce days or weeks later. In the meantime the scammer uses various tactics to get the victim to send some of the money back to them leaving the victim ultimately in the hole for whatever they sent after the check inevitably bounces.
hma0h0k,jonsonmac,11/27/2021,1,It could be helpful with lower interest.  I personally took out a debt consolidation loan about ten years ago.  It helped in the short term but I didn’t change my spending habits.  My credit cards got maxed out once again and I filed for bankruptcy last year.

hma6ysj,ErikRogers,11/27/2021,1,Yeah its still something of a common business-oriented language.
hmah4jr,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,They dont need someone to pay off the entire loan in order to be profitable. They need them to just make interest payments for a short period of time.    Lets say someone takes out a $2000 loan from a scummy company. They pay $500 a month for 6 months. Most likely they have barely touched the principle.    Right about now the customer is catching on that they will never get out of this debt hole.    So the customer already paid them $3k of Interest on a $2k loan. The company has already made back its original $2k and made $1k of profit.  Customer can default now and they still made a profit.  They are predatory... They find desperate people and suck them dry just long enough to hit their profit goal.

hmd62e0,Anddrol,11/27/2021,1,As you stated in an above comment you’re paying the other mortgage payment. That payment assuming it’s coming from your account that they will be looking at might garner some questions. It might stressing the might part be factored into your DTI. I had to explain everything that came out of my account that was a payment whether or not that debt was on my credit report or not.

hmbugm1,Joloven,11/27/2021,1,Oof. Thanks for the reality check. It seems key. I did look up properly taxes and its around 1200 a year around here. I can see 1500 easy so the real ownership cost of a home is like 25% higher as a rule than it appears.  I appreciate the emergency fund advise too. All of thus is key to planning

hmb8srm,TodaysMenace,11/27/2021,1,Came here to say this. Your credit card is a revolving account. You also should have a history of making amortized payments. To build credit for my wife I opened a CD and borrowed the exact amount against it. Worked like a charm.

hmd98mq,SnooGuavas1745,11/27/2021,1,They must not accept too many different insurance types because I have not experienced that at all. As a patient or as a biller. (Note: I do live in a highly populated area so I’m not sure if this makes a difference at all. Many places have waiting lists to even be seen.)
hm9rwka,tastygluecakes,11/27/2021,2,Seems like you should be doing the exact opposite then.  In an emergency it’s difficult to access the equity in your home.  But selling some stock in your brokerage account can be all settled up in 3 days.  If it were me I’d do post tax investing > extra principal.  You are still saving to have a safety net if you need it but going to get a better return over the long run.  The reason to put extra principal down is to not have a house payment sooner.  But consider how long it will take for that to actually impact your cash flow every month.  You might be 15-20 years away from seeing that benefit (instead of 30).    And yes there are 401k like options for self employed.  Just my two cents - you gotta do what you are comfortable with.  Good luck with business my friend!
hmc5vf0,frzn_dad,11/27/2021,1,I would more say it is baked into the pricing already. Though for sale by owner where they wont pay realtor fees is a thing in some markets.   The buyers money pays the realtor in most cases.
hmcrzlm,WizardOfIF,11/27/2021,1,Be prepared for them to suggest that they hold the credit in case of any unanticipated charges hitting your account in the near future. You should still be able to politely decline their offer to hold the credit and assure them that you wont have any problems covering any charges should the arise.
hmd8rjp,desquibnt,11/27/2021,1,Call the company and have them revert the change. Easy peasy
hmcn9z2,metalguysilver,11/27/2021,1,I never said crashes are the end of the world. I think you’re barking up the wrong tree here. All I’m saying is that keeping 6 instead of 3 months of expenses (not income) in cash is the safest easiest thing you can do and does not hinder your wealth building all that much. Have a good life  Edit: I’m a Boglehead we are on the same team but you should know that average S&P growth is not that high no five year period is a sure thing for growth (ten years is another story) and you are mistaken in the way that you calculate percentages (15% for five years is >100% gain for example).

hmd8cj4,bkdlays,11/27/2021,1,Furniture  stores are notoriously shady
hmcr62t,colterlovette,11/27/2021,1,So to be blunt:  Unless your returning above 20% on the cash your using in the market you’re at a significant net loss because you aren’t actually investing money you own.   Unless you have liquid cash sitting around that amounts to above the total of what you have in debt every dollar you have is not actually yours.   You’re technically taking someone else’s money and playing with it. On top of that you’re paying them to do that. So for simplicity every dollar you put into the market you’ve actually spent $1.20 meaning right out the gate if you’re not guarantee returning at least $1.20 you’re just lighting money on fire that you don’t have.   In the end the best way to get out of debt (in my mind) and stay out is to remind yourself that debt is simply other peoples money that you then trade future time and effort to return. So all the paychecks you make right now… all the hours of your life you spend to get it.. it’s not actually yours. You spent it awhile ago and now it’s debt.
hmcb24p,ecksate,11/27/2021,1,So I cant know if you are or are going to be taken advantage of but i do know that doesnt sound strange for a startup.  They dont want to stay the same size they want to grow.  Getting new skills to existing people who have the business context in my opinion is good business as is taking care of people well enough to keep them around.    My experience growing with a startup has been good (but Im a techie) but I really like the advice to never stop looking for a job.
hmd4sdj,bking158,11/27/2021,1,Just a heads up it only grows if youre investing it. If its just sitting in the brokerage account its likely not doing much for you.  Also that plan would require you to be keeping records of everything you paid out of pocket to then submit for reimbursement from the account whenever you decide to access it.

Only when arbitrary administrative codes get involved does the definition of preventative become separate from the definition of diagnostic and that is shitty.
hm9pkmx,jmfsn,11/27/2021,1,Id recommend you to open the account. Theyll also ask you to fill a W8-BEN certificate to claim that youll be paying any capital gains/dividends in your country and not in the USA (most European countries have a treaty for that). If you share your specific country I can probably point you to the right place. After youve taken ownership of the shares you can do as you please. If you need to sell them it can trigger capital gains but thats another issue.
hmayjkz,Anonymoose2021,11/27/2021,1,Banks will also question a large cash withdrawal if they suspect that their customer may be getting scammed.      Some customers have tried to get banks to absorb their losses by saying that the bank should have prevented them from withdrawing and paying the scammers.  You will also get a lot of questions asked of you if you go to a Walmart and try to purchase a large amount of gift cards as this is a common way for scammers to extract money from their victims.

hmbn7px,tofurito,11/27/2021,1,Can you afford counseling? It sounds like you have some unresolved issues that could be assist by that. I was homeless from 19-23 years of age but am now making right under 6 figures in a somewhat low cost of living area. It has taken me years of therapy to unlearn the difference between catastrophic thinking and erring on the side of caution. I can relate to the clothes thing. What I would suggest is investing in good pieces of clothing that you know will last for years versus fast fashion when you want or need something new.
hmcufs4,7loUge,11/27/2021,1,Ive done it. There was an option for paying current bill current balance or other. I selected other made the overpayment and ended with a negative balance. This was a couple of years ago so maybe they dont allow it anymore or it was specific to the cc I was using.    If the card has a limit I dont think this would allow you to get around the limit. After having the card for a while you can apply to have the limit raised. If its a secured card you can see about making a deposit to raise the limit.
hmcr4uy,applexpeel,11/27/2021,1,yeah it was 18 months. i just rounded the 66 nd some change to $70. The main concern i had was would my statement show i have a $1200 purchase or would it say 70 since that’s all i’ll be paying on it that month.
hmckgfg,cobrakook,11/27/2021,1,I worked at a small company about 3 years ago. One day we had 4 people show up to start work. All 4 were scammed. They applied to a job posting that misled them to think they were applying to a job at the company I worked for. The scammer held chat interviews and hired them on the spot. The scammers made the employees buy computers and office supplies and that they would be reembursed on their first day of work.   Felt so bad.
hmd41pf,x_driven_x,11/27/2021,1,Photo retouching is done so cheaply overseas it doesn’t make sense for anyone in America to do it (or be paid by a business to do it).   Sorry this happened to you man :(  I see you’re a photographer. Look into real estate photography for realtors.
hmd2znz,JonnyManhattan,11/27/2021,1,This happens all the time in scams and its not that surprising. They sent bunk checks and had the OP cash them and send them money in return. If a scam wasnt surprising it wouldnt be so effective.
hmcog51,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,Some to the point reading material for you https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/how-to-start-investing  Have a 1+ month emergency fund or amount that would make you feel comfortable incase youre unable to work and need it for monthly recurring expenses.  Pay all debt in full if over 3-4% apr interest.  Max out your employer 401k if they offer a matching % or if you want to be in a lower tax bracket since this contribution will lower your tax liability.  Open a Roth IRA and max out that 6k limit yearly.  Checkout Vanguard or SoFi to open your Roth IRA and setup auto deposit :)

hm9f3ag,UpbeatPiglet3217,11/27/2021,1,Yeah I completely get you it’s just that I don’t really pay much in bills so I’m just like how much do I keep to spend on “luxury things” I guess..like clothes going out with friends etc and then how much I put away in saving. Yeah basically I jsut don’t get how much I allow my self to spend when I really don’t pay bills
hmd765g,Psychological-Cow-21,11/27/2021,1,I wouldnt recommend disclosing 100% of your finances because they will try to persuade you to allocate all funds with them.

hmcp5j5,Lone_Vagrant,11/27/2021,1,I grew up quite poor but now me and my wife got good stable full time jobs. Pay is a bit above the median where I live. But I am very frugal and barely spend money on myself. My wife was even more so she was super smart with shopping around maximising whatever vouchers and promotion there is around.   As we got more comfortable in our financial situation we figured we should treat ourselves a bit now that we can afford it without making a dent to our savings. I am pushing her to buy things she has been eyeing for years e.g nice cosmetics that treated her skin better(acne and oily skin) or a nice perfume or a dress. I have to like force her even. I still dont feel like spending on myself though. But seeing my wife happy is enough to get me going.  In the end she is more happy for having made the purchase because it was worth it.  You can still treat yourself while being frugal just not to the extremes. A little bit here and there to improve your life and mental wellness. If you did not break the bank you would still feel proud you manage to treat yourself and got a deal on top of that.
hmd7tf2,Stable-McCafe,11/27/2021,1,Tax benefits dual income benefits depending on the couple.
hmd462v,mbensasi,11/27/2021,1,I’m contributing 15% right now which comes out to be about $10k. So I’d have to double that to max it out not sure I can afford it right now. But I do max out my Roth IRA so that’s something.   I also have some savings that I was going to invest if they decided to forgive some student loans but that’s looking less and less likely so once payments begin on those again I might just wipe a big chunk of them out.
hmd3kjx,snut123,11/27/2021,1,They use confusing language on purpose. The interest is the annual rate go with the higher rate .50%. Honestly they are both pretty low and I would put my money in something else.

hmc6f7x,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,Its not that simple. Those percentages have to be met by withholding and equal timely estimated tax payments for safe harbor to be met.   That said making an estimated tax payment now rather than waiting until you file your tax return will reduce the underpayment penalty you may owe.

hmap7ss,Woody1918,11/27/2021,1,Yes I agree.  I think I will leave the 200k I already have in the target date fund and allocate future to more aggressive funds for 10 years then maybe move it as I get closer to retirement - WOW look at me auditing in real life 😂😂😂😂😂
hmczb09,returntoglory9,11/27/2021,1,I respectfully but vehemently disagree with this advice. You will pay transactions costs and taxes again you will have to go through the shopping process again and you will have to move again.   Moving frequently is a great way to watch the equity you built vanish in one-time transaction costs. Do the breakeven calculation for your situation and see how long you have to stay in one house for it to make sense.
hmd4h8m,949goingoff,11/27/2021,1,Depends on what you’re doing to some extent but generally a smaller company would be better served by a smaller firm.
hmcvev5,yuckfoubitch,11/27/2021,1,You should select an amount that you spend on yourself every month or year. Call it the “for me” part of your budget. You can save money for all of those things while enjoying your money as well. I think excessive saving with no end in sight (no goal for the saving other than a “what if” scenario) is a toxic mentality that is perpetuated a lot by people on this sub and in popular finance culture. You won’t sacrifice your future by spending a bit extra on things that will improve your mental and physical quality of life.
hm997dm,outroot,11/27/2021,1,In addition to some of the good comments as to why use multiple 529 accounts I do separate accounts because Ive calculated for each child to get the same amount by the time they reach college (inflation adjusted).

hmd7rv4,Coug_Love,11/27/2021,1,Its usually not really a negotiation. You tell them you cannot afford the bill and they offer you a payment plan and/or forgive a portion of the bill. They will usually ask for proof of your income. Forgiveness usually works with hospitals and large medical facilities. I have extensive medical bills and know the drill pretty well.

hmbxatu,originallycoolname,11/27/2021,1,Its common practice I believe to stick half of a raise into 401k then other half to savings. I dont see anything wrong with splitting the other half into quarters. That would give you 7.5k/30k of that raise or $625/month. Seem like too much? Take even less then youre even better off
hmd33ip,TK_TK_,11/27/2021,1,We save for it as a consistent monthly expense exactly because home maintenance should not be an emergency—it’s all going to come up sooner or later and you want to have the money when you need it. Some years you don’t use much of your maintenance fund at all and some years you need a new hot water heater fence and roof all within weeks. Save a little every month and it won’t hurt or feel like an emergency when stuff comes up.
hmcp62y,Eldi_Bee,11/27/2021,1,Yeah making 120k through 1099 work OP probably would be better off to put himself on payroll. My friend did that at the behest of her accountant once she started clearing 6 figures of profit. Saves her some tax money too.
hm9xgs7,Neatguyonline,11/27/2021,1,What starting salary are you using for the CS degree?  This looks like 6 years in you’re estimating 80k?  That is very very conservative.  A lot of CS majors make more than that day 1 out of school.
hmcpla1,eyedoc11,11/27/2021,1,This is a classic reddit /r/personalfinance post.  This person like most people does not understand how their insurance works.  Sounds like they have not yet met their deductible.    Insurance is not meant to pay for every single thing its there to protect you from unforeseen expenses.   My auto insurance does not pay for oil changes and my home insurance does not cover routine maintenance.   They are there for when my car crashes and my house burns.  Most (but not all) people have deductibles expect to pay something before you meet it.  When you get hit by a bus or get cancer youll be glad you have insurance.

hmcqa3k,Serpico2,11/27/2021,1,This is not personal finance advice but in my opinion you shouldn’t marry anyone at 22. You or they or both will be completely different people by 32. You may still be compatible and in love or you might have a divorce and a kid or two under your belt caught in the middle.   That said best wishes either way. I accept that I am a reptile without emotion.
hmaslf7,ThekingofShibauni777,11/27/2021,1,Yes this a a common thing they do control you bank account pass off fake checks and transfer the money to there account and you get blaimed if that makes sense but if thats true that should be all on your bank for not catching it lawyer up if you need to

hmc4thh,SofaSpudAthlete,11/27/2021,1,> …. I get to work with an actual marketing team collaborate and pick their brain on their knowledge/processes…  Look for this in your next role. This is how you will start to see which areas in marketing you find interesting and want to pursue.   Hold out for a role that isn’t a pay cut. This era is being referred to as the “great resignation” because employees are leaving and for more money in large numbers. You will find another role.

hmbz9oj,phadrus56,11/27/2021,1,Go talk to the doctor.   He can code it differently so the insurance will pay for it.
hmcotjq,not_a_moogle,11/27/2021,1,yeah but if insurance wont for it anyways that defeats its purpose.  I wouldnt cancel mine its from work and is pretty decent.  Just saying insurance not paying for stuff sounds more like a scam.
hmbxtx2,tstill_,11/27/2021,1,So you are looking to leave your job and your manager has been nice about it and wanted to help you grow in your career/possible move on and you are mad that he is ready to replace you?  Taking a lower paying job that you arent really interested in doesnt really make sense unless your current situation is toxic and since you said  your boss just offered to help alleviate your workload that should make your current situation more bearable while you look for a new job.
hmblgu5,not_falling_down,11/27/2021,1,Its better than a general table. When you make you own account it will show you what you specifically are projected to receive. The closer to retirement you are the more accurate the figures are likely to be.

Talked with HR after 6 months of OJT not helping and they said lower title and expectations same pay no raise next raise cycle. He felt relieved because he was really struggling and had the opportunity to progress to the senior role at his own pace.
hmas9pi,Joy8181,11/27/2021,1,Renting cheap isn’t a thing in high cost of living areas. You really don’t seem to understand that some things would be great to do but are not always possible for everyone  so adjustments can be made elsewhere to get similar end results.

hmbwele,Earthquake14,11/27/2021,1,I am making $55k a year before the raise. That’s about $3300 take-home per month. $850 goes to rent and utilities because I don’t want to live somewhere I don’t like.   My only actual debt is my $200 a month car lease. I’ve only been working full-time for less than 3 years so I didn’t have the cash to buy a car that wasn’t a death trap.   Like I said in the post I saved/invested around 1500 a month since I started working in 2019. The difference goes to groceries other smaller bills entertainment etc. Being able to save a third is pretty “below the means” no?
hmciitc,Elegeios,11/27/2021,1,Nope. $500k-$600k house by yourself at a current $67k a year is too much and its still too much at $83k a year. Thats 6x your *projected income* and the most people recommend these days is what 3x? Maybe slightly more depending on cost of living?  Could you swing the mortgage payment? If you even got approved for that big a loan yeah maybe you could swing it with your raise barely but youd be dead house poor and thats not even accounting for maintenance wear and tear property taxes etc.  Dont do this.  &#x200B  edit: assuming your math is right at take home theres no chance in hell you can afford this lol. Think about what percentage of takehome would be taken up by housing!
hm9qwhj,Kiole,11/27/2021,1,Does your closing cost estimate include title transfer real estate tax property tax prepayment insurance prepayment closing fees origination fees and buying the remaining fuel from seller?

hm999ku,okiechuckd,11/27/2021,1,Good point. I just feel like for how much this is putting me out between the 30 minute drive bringing the wife and kid for another hour of paperwork etc. just to fix his fuck up I don’t really want to mess with it.

hm97d5x,Magnusg,11/27/2021,1,If your company provides a Roth 401k option it might be smart to contribute to that you usually still get the match into the 401k and the benefit of the Roth is that in an emergency you can actually pull out your contribution tax free (not the gains) because the money has been taxed already.    A Roth emergency fund is a good idea.

hmbyzfc,Synaps4,11/27/2021,1,Buying a house is out of the question without savings I think.  Moving is going to be difficult because you have to move 2 jobs as well.  Looking for a higher paying job in the new area is possible but seems very difficult without the car.  Do you have no belongings? Moving without a car is pretty hard. Maybe you can rent/borrow a small truck but thats the least of your concerns.  I think you may have to look for other housing in your area so you can keep the jobs and stay focused on your college so you can get that higher paying job.  College unlocking a better job for you would solve this whole thing.

I switched from club fitness $22 a month to the ymca $31 a month. The club fitness was so much better and bigger in terms than f weight lifting. But the ymca being right next door was way more worth it as I could wait over and not have to waste 20 min a day driving to and back and waste gas.

hmcr9zi,cyanruby,11/27/2021,1,I started spending more when I realized that happiness now is an *investment* in my future wellness. And its low risk I know I can spend money now to get happiness but its unclear how much happiness that money might buy in the future due perhaps to declining health or missed opportunities. Remember to invest in yourself because its the only investment with 100% security.
hmbwls2,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/27/2021,1,Unless you are paying an annual fee I would keep credit cards open to improve your credit score.  You may want to spend a small amount eg Amazon $1 balance addition once a year to keep them active.  Assuming you pay off credit cards each month in full there are no annual fee cards that provide good benefits.  Eg citi double cash 2% back on everything.
hmbkzi1,bobcats2002,11/27/2021,1,Oh man :/ I really hope age isnt a factor but it looks like it may be.   Nothing flashy its an older Toyota. KBB values it at $7000 with the VIN search. Its a preowned car with 1 accident reported on Carfax (from the original owner).
hmba1z2,ronald_mcdonald_4prz,11/27/2021,1,Figure out what your NEEDS are. Sounds like $500/month. Give yourself a small entertainment budget. This will leave you with some money to pay off your debts.   However step 1 is to get an emergency fund. You need some money to fall back on if you need it.   Then pay off your debt aggressively
hmcr4qq,arparris,11/27/2021,1,I got married at 21 and we joined finances.  Our wedding cost us $3k because the first thing her POS father in law said when we told him we were engaged was that he wasn’t paying for it.  (Nothing to do with us rushing or me being bad he’s just a genuinely bad person).  Marrying her was the best thing I ever did for my finances.  We balance each other and she’s the one that got me started on investing when I was in grad school and she was working to put me through.  Now I work and she stays at home with our infant and will continue to do so until he’s school aged.    The caveat here is that you have to have the right person and be like minded in your goals (or at least have enough give and take to be able to compromise where no one feels like they are losing).

hm903dm,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,I dont think its too much. Personally Id probably increase it a little bit if I was in your shoes. I have the same thought of just wanting to save more and more though (also 29). I figure front weighting my retirement savings is a lot less stressful than playing catch up.   That said its a reasonable amount and if youre happy with life meeting other saving goals and comfortable with retirement projections at the current rate.... just keep on chugging.

No tax on the money going in.  Yes tax on the money coming out.  This is of course assuming everything is pretax (traditional).
hm9rev5,already-taken-wtf,11/27/2021,5,How does one work part time and retire in their 20s????
hma91r1,ThisIsAMonere,11/27/2021,1,It’s fine for you to believe this about marriage but as others have said what’s the plan for if you break up?  If you don’t plan on breaking up ever great! Sign some papers that say you’re married *solely* to protect the surviving partner in case one of you unexpectedly dies. You don’t even have to tell anyone and as someone who is married I assure you the process of getting the paperwork done to be legally married is a very boring bland experience that can feel like getting a drivers license renewed if you want it to. Weddings are outdated sure but marriage is a legal protection of your shared assets.  If you’re not yet sure you’re never going to break up then you must have a legal plan in place before you buy this house with your partner.
hmcff6n,_THE_asshole,11/27/2021,1,Ill be honest here and people can say whatever and take it as you may.  It sounds like your boss is offering you the help you need.  This is rare.  I do however always tell people to always be looking for advancement.  Hes offering to pay for courses  thats a good thing.  I would ask him for a 5% increase a person to help and train and take the course trainings to add to your resume.  While continuing to keep an eye out for advancement opportunities.  Worst case you get some certs train your replacement and find a new job.  Best case you get some help certs and your boss sees the benefits of your hard work and you having help.

hmbcndk,sonibroc,11/27/2021,1,Your harsh question is a good one.  When we were young I asked my husband what he would by if he was single.  Now I ask that same question if he was widowed today.  Its the easiest mechanism to ensure that I hear what *he* wants instead anything adjustments he makes based on what he thinks/assume I want.  We have this conversation about once every 5-years to determine if we are happy with what we have or update what we have or move.  Tastes hobby and work changes its always a great conversation.

hmc2vqt,TwoWrongsAreSoRight,11/27/2021,1,If you can afford the pay cut go. if youre already unhappy then they arent goin to do anything to make it better regardless of what they say.  The underlying problem is this that your boss should have been able to see the workload was too much for 1 person.  If he didnt then hes incompetent and you should leave.  If he did that means he didnt care and you should leave.  Whatever hes offered you at this point is likely temporary.  With all that said always have your resume up and listed as looking for work.  Its smart to know whats out there and to take the occasional interview so you keep your skills sharp.  It doesnt mean that you are ready to jump ship.  Thats what you tell any manager who asks and if they cant understand that then you probably dont wanna work for them anyway.  The bottom line is you must be in charge of your own career because no company will act in your best interest.
hmbzxmc,optimaloptimist101,11/27/2021,1,Just treat it like a debit card and only charge what you would normally would. As long as you pay your full statement balance by the due date the APR is irrelevant. Which card is it? I have a feeling it is from Capital One with the APR looking like that. Pls tell me it has no annual fee lol.
hmd0kc7,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,But as /u/vinogato1 was trying to say you cant typically get cash back on a purchase of a home. You can typically only do that on a refinance if you have equity.  A bank is NOT going to give you an initial mortgage for more than the amount you pay for your house.
hmcwlog,lilgremgrem,11/27/2021,1,That’s certainly a red flag. Often companies will already have equipment to provide for you. Or they would outline that an allowance would be given for purchasing of those materials in the contract and most likely would give you $500 to spend as an example. Or you purchase the equipment based on a contractually agreed upon amount (i.e. company will reimburse you for up to $500 for equipment). You would then purchase those things and send the invoice or receipt which they would then reimburse you for.   All of that too say the big red flag is the moving around of money. No company would ever give you a sum of money and then request a sum back.  Edit: realized you’re not OP asking and instead you’re asking OP why they didn’t find it suspicious. Going to leave this here anyway for OP to know.
hmd5lw5,impressive_specimen,11/27/2021,1,With work being bank hours its going to be tough to be able to make it in there personally to discuss that so looks like it will be investopedia thanks for that resource.

hmb84qo,jellicle,11/27/2021,1,Haha no.  If banks were interested in helping the customer they would process credits to the account first followed by debits.  But they do the opposite.  It is 100% designed to maximize the fees charged to the customer.

hmba4ew,thmm0358,11/27/2021,1,I live in Canada Ontario and there are no intricate laws on selling baked good from home. I do own and work on a stainless steel table for safety precautions though.   I think keeping my job is the best bet too as much as I dont want to. Thank you for your response.
hmaq7h1,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,Perfect situation for Roth then!   Either one is better than not taking advantage of the tax-free compounding benefits of 401k/IRAs.
hma00c6,OlympusAmateur,11/27/2021,1,Bump it to full match - 6%. Your looking at just over $1000 annually on your side. Or about $20 bucks per week. Shave the $20 from pocket money. Work a part time job to build savings or add to school loan. Im 72 years. My wife and I were educators never making large salaries. But I always maxed retirement funding even with children in college. We just got back from 3 weeks in the Mediterranean and travel like that several times per year only because we lived below our means and maxed retirement funding. Youre young and have time on your side. You can always scramble for extra immediate money needs. In the senior years scrambling for extra cash often means would you like fries with that burger sir. Bump that 401K to full match.
hmae2m9,NoFilterNoLimits,11/27/2021,1,My husband and I rely on each other and built what we have as a team.  If we’d waited to be completely self sufficient independently we might still not be married 😝.  We wanted a teammate not an independent roommate we had sex with  Mutually attacking financial goals as a team has been much more beneficial than trying to do it separately next to each other IMHO
hmczyjx,kenji-benji,11/27/2021,1,Most employers do not limit the maximum deferral. As others have mentioned the effective maximum is limited by taxation.  Some employers limit how frequently you can make deferral changes and there may also be a delay between requesting a change and implementing that change.  Id speak with your hr department or payroll.
hmbtvg3,BastidChimp,11/27/2021,1,You may want to check out dividend stocks on the Dividend Aristocrats list. Many are blue chip stocks that have been around for a while that pay out a regular quarterly dividend.

hmayctd,nothlit,11/27/2021,1,Have you tried using the [IRS withholding estimator](https://www.irs.gov/w4app) tool?  For the worksheet you should use your federal taxable income so number 2 in your list basically. Whatever would show up in box 1 of your W-2.
hmc7igf,LordofMud,11/27/2021,1,Thank you so much for your comment!   I agree with the PD for saving 3-6 months of cash as an emergency fund. I want to start building it up. I am thinking about starting it with $3000 and then going from there.   The only change in our lifestyle is going to be a new apartment. We have been looking into new apartments before getting to know about this windfall. And I personally consider this to be my wifes money as it is from her grandmother. We are not planning on dipping into it for any lifestyle adjustment/changes.  Can you recommend any companies we can go with for an IRA?  Again thank you!
hmd3ozz,Little_Yin_Yang,11/27/2021,1,Have you ever considered psychotherapy? Not saying you need this but it sounds like a control thing the way anorexia isn’t necessarily about trying to be beautiful but about control over one’s food and feeling like one has control over their life.  I think the most concerning area is that you’re living in unsafe places just to save money. I’ve had a couple sketchy housing situations to try to save a few bucks back when I was paying off my student loans. I understand trying to save-I’ve always had a housemate as this was an easy way to cut costs for internet rent etc. But your home should be a place of refuge not a place that makes you “miserable… more often than not.”   Best of luck to you mate! 🍀

hmbqwrf,lucky_ducker,11/27/2021,1,After an accident the police will typically call for a tow to an impound lot. If you can quickly arrange a tow yourself (maybe have AAA Plus) have your car towed to a *body shop* not an impound lot. Ive done this twice in the past 20 something years and never had to pay for impound storage.

hmbx7v3,PickleJuice_DrPepper,11/27/2021,1,We bought new construction and used my aunt as our realtor because we knew it was the builder paying her. We found the house and submitted our offer on our own. She did nothing other than provide her office for us to sign the papers. Easy pay day for her.  Edit to add - we did ask the builder if they would reduce the price if we did not use a realtor but they said no. Might be something to ask.
hmdabug,aznkor,11/27/2021,1,>my credit limit was being raised to $1000 \[…\] if I have money I spend it  Keep in mind that its not your money its the credit card companys that youre merely borrowing.
hmcvnmv,jdwazzu61,11/27/2021,1,You can still call and ask. You would be surprised if you have a good credit score and income how often asking will get them to raise it (especially if you tell them why you want to increase it)
hmb3m47,Delta080,11/27/2021,1,Selling your car and using it to pay down your debt won’t help your problem of overspending. You need to learn to be responsible with your money and stay within your means.

hmcqoo9,Dark-Jedi-Lobster,11/27/2021,1,I was advised by my credit union that Id need 2 years worth of 1099 work for a mortgage. Also its the main reason I now ask employers going forward if Im 1099 or W2.      I vote wait a few years and buy it outright - by then the houses might be a little cheaper.
hmam7c9,VacationLover1,11/27/2021,1,If the land is worth $1000 and it will cost them $4000 to $5000 in legal fees I don’t see how it’s ‘FREE REALESTATE’.. you’re paying more than it’s actually worth in fees
hmahww4,RoastyMcGiblets,11/27/2021,1,Land thats not buildable doesnt increase in value and you pay taxes on it yearly. You are taking on liability if someone gets hurt on the land or dumps stuff on it (including possibly anything toxic that requires expensive cleanup) that might cost you money. Low risk sure but why take on any risk if you arent making money?   If it was 100 acres and there was the possibility of a chunk of it maybe being developable someday it might be worth rolling the dice. Also larger plots of wetlands sometimes have value as developers can use them for leverage when doing new developments (they offer to dedicate it as public space with a conservation easement in exchange for being able to upzone the density for whatever they want to build). But 5 acres? Im with OP on this one pass.
hm9aglc,radwagonier,11/27/2021,3,I’m guessing a 401k or traditional IRA or even a taxable brokerage account would be superior to a Roth IRA.   Choosing Roth means you believe she may be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. I’m going to say at this point that’s impossible.   Increasing 401k contributions or investing in a traditional IRA would give her tax savings now which she could use to save more.   She likely will pay no taxes in retirement no matter what she does now.   The zero long term capital gains bracket also roughly overlays the 12% federal income bracket. So taxable investments are on the table also - tax free!  Roth is a bad choice in my opinion. You are locking in the highest tax rate of her life.   In terms of asset allocation I’d stick with a target date fund or a “life strategy” fund.  If she can save ~150k before she retires that’s $500/mo at a 5% withdrawal rate.
hmatws7,iranisculpable,11/27/2021,1,13 percent is below average.  With a credit score of 641 I would be concerned that any attempt to ask for a lower rate will instead trigger a hike.
hmce4xe,Sheldon1979,11/27/2021,1,I would call your provider and see if you have any recourse on the $3200 that you transfered to them in the UK we have authorised push payments scam protection which is when you authorise the payment and transfer it yourself and most of the time the bank will refund the money and go after the fraudsters.  You may not have something similar but still report it as fraud you never know what you can do they might be able to reclaim it or refund it and there fraud department will deal with this day in day out they will be able to inform you what options you have.
hmbqkcc,cgm808,11/27/2021,1,You’ll take a hard credit inquiry in your credit score. If you have a big purchase on the horizon you may want to factor this in.
hmb0300,Poctah,11/27/2021,1,Just call them up. They should issue a check right after you call or may have already. I had this happen when my daughter got a mole removed. They said it would cost $800 and made me pay before the procedure. Turns out since it was to check for cancer and prevention that my insurance pays 100% so I owed nothing. As soon as I got the eob I called and they sent me a check in the mail that day for the $800(took 3 days to get to me in mail but they may be able to do a chargeback depending on how you paid which could be faster). I was also told they would have found the error at the end of the month and issued a check anyways but if you call it should speed up the process.
hma243s,russ257,11/27/2021,1,There is no issue with this as long as he pays you back. My wife and I share a phone plan with her parents. MIL just writes me a check each month for their portion of the bill.
hmcls62,WaftIt,11/27/2021,1,Heres my experience having married my college sweetheart.  I hope it helps someone!  Weve been together for 10 years married for 5.  We were together for 2 years in college and moved to the same city after graduation. He went into a phd program immediately after graduating I went to work i the private sector.  We lived with roommates and I came up with the number I felt we needed for a modest wedding in our area and an emergency fund.  Then I got to work paying off my student loans (he had no debt leaving undergrad).  I shared my savings plans and laid out a potential time table.  About two years after graduation I met my goals and proposed.  Neither of us are diamond people so we picked out simple matching engagement rings that cost ~$150 each.  We timed our wedding to coincide with the end of our leases when we were 26 to ensure that I could get him on my health insurance before he had to get off of his parents.  He moved in about a week before the wedding and we combined our finances though we do each have an account that is in our own name.    We use YNAB to track our expenses and fill in a net worth spreadsheet every month.  That works well for us as a system for transparency and creating opportunities for communication about money.  Whether or not filing as married gets you a tax break depends on a number of factors.  Living together and combining your finances impacts you financially in significant ways beyond taxes but it is all down to how the couple choose to live as a unit.  My husband and I are both savers but we help each other let go a bit and spend on things that make us happy.

hmba7kc,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,Could affect whether property ownership for rental can be considered part of the LLC was my thinking.  They are a common vehicle for real estate investments. The OP had the idea of investing in rental property as way to lower taxes. The structure of an LLC is determinant as to how it is taxed. So while not directly a defined tax entity  it will most definitely affect taxation.   Per the IRS Depending on elections made by the LLC and the number of members the IRS will treat an LLC as either a corporation partnership or as part of the LLC’s owner’s tax return (a “disregarded entity”). Specifically a domestic LLC with at least two members is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes unless it files Form 8832 and affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation. For income tax purposes an LLC with only one member is treated as an entity disregarded as separate from its owner unless it files Form 8832 and elects to be treated as a corporation. However for purposes of employment tax and certain excise taxes an LLC with only one member is still considered a separate entity.

hmaflhb,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,Not everyone defaults on the loan.  There are enough people paying back the loans plus shitloads of interest to cover their losses on the ones that default and still provide plenty of profit.   If these lenders were operating at a loss they wouldnt be in the business.
hm9x4je,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,We could match a Roth IRA but we couldnt match a 401(k).  Yes I know all about the HSA.  I had one for a year or so and maxed it out.  However we are currently TTC so I switched back to my husbands plan for both coverage and cost efficiency.   My companys HDHP was a. Incredibly expensive and b. had a $4000 deductible with a 8k OOPM.  I drool at these companies that have a $1500 deductible for a HDHP.

hmc2ao0,obsessedsoul,11/27/2021,1,Well if youre trying to build credit and have no intentions on paying on time you already failed. You cant try to build up your credit and not pay your bills on time. If you want to build your credit up youll need to pay your credit cards on time in full. I would suggest you make smart purchases. You never want to go over 10% of your credit limit. It will lower your credit score if you do.   Make some small purchases like groceries gas phone etc but dont go over 10% to 15% of your credit limit ($75) and split the payment (when you do that itll increase your credit) pay 15 days before your statement date and 3 day before. Another way of increasing your credit score is being on a trusted friend or family members credit card as am authorized user. I put my brother and cousin on my credit card and their credit score went up 100+ but again someone you trust and is responsible. Thats all the advice I can give ...good luck with everything

hmd55bz,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,Real estate can be good debt and wealth building if you plan to live in that house for minimum 5-10 years to recoup from all closing fees.   Keep your 1+ month emergency fund in easily accessible  HYSA or other account   Max out your 401k first and lower your tax liability   Additionally contribute to a HSA plan if you want and lower your tax liability even further could drop to 12% bracket instead of 22% youre currently in.   Max out your Roth IRA   Investing portfolio with remainder of funds in VTI or other index funds. Avoid high expense ratio funds avoid fees from an asset manager you can do it yourself!

I know some companies offer a promotion when you initially sign up after they run your credit but is there a card that does this after sign up? Amex plan it is 90 days and I’m pretty sure charges a fee. Genuinely interested. Have excellent credit but enough credit cards so if there’s one that consistently does 90 days or 24 months no interest with no fee I wanna know about it.

hmcm3tv,colterlovette,11/27/2021,1,Ya… welcome to financing in sole proprietorship (or any self employment scenario).   You have to build ~3 years of tax returns showing your income they then average them to get your qualifying income (at least that’s how it was for me). They do this to make sure they’re lending on a steady income stream and not one that just had a good year.  Also prepare for significant down payment requirements no matter your score. :/  I have a few buddies that put themselves on payroll within their companies just to have reportable W2 income to avoid this. Not sure on the details of that arrangement but it seemed to work for them when they where just kicking off.

hmb96on,awkwardsysadmin,11/27/2021,1,I have invested in some P2P loans before and even somewhat high risk borrowers will usually pay back their loans. Even those that default usually at least make several months of payments so even loans that are a loss arent a total loss. With a large enough portfolio of loans those that pay in full with interest make up for the losses although obviously the defaults drag down returns. Its not the same demographic as people taking out pay day loans or other similarly predatory loans but the riskier borrowers just pay even higher interest rates where it becomes relatively realistic for most defaults to still be profitable.
hma7n0q,bros402,11/27/2021,1,You could set up a trust for them with specific payout terms - that might be the smart idea. Maybe some caveats like if money is needed for living expenses they must provide receipts/proof and the money will be paid from the trust to the person who is owed the money

hmbcr48,whatsmynamema,11/27/2021,1,Why would they waive it?
hmd9x7f,scavengercat,11/27/2021,1,They stated that they read the contract and there was no clause in it that could justify this.
hmb8kw1,Altruistic_Profile96,11/27/2021,1,On a debit card it can get dicey.  Lesser banks would fight it.  I don’t get charged for anything with USAA so I don’t know what high costs to which you refer.  My insurance costs went up for a bit and I switched but after some improvements the insurance is cheaper than anything I’ve seen but everybody should shop their insurance around every five years or so.
hmcrfdf,sneaky_fart,11/27/2021,1,I ordered a vehicle in October that wont be delivered until February.  I put a $1k deposit down.  This is very normal for special ordered cars.  In this market people are having to do it regularly instead of taking delivery from dealer stock.   its a bit weird at first.  This is very normal.  If you are taking a car from the next delivery to the dealer get the VIN you will receive in writing and the price.   The dealer will 100% have the VIN.   Youre 99.9% likely going to pay MSRP.  Do not pay more than MSRP.  If you are ordering from the factory the VIN wont be available until about 4-6 weeks before the actual build date.  In this case get every option the car will have in writing along with an order number from the factory.  Youll pay MSRP.  Dont pay more.  The other option is that the dealer wants your cash and will try to find a car from another dealer.  Be wary of this.  Dont put a non refundable deposit down and have some kid drive a car from another lot to you.  Its no fun getting a new car with 800 miles on it from 4 states away.  Just ask: where the car is coming from.  What year the car is.  What is the VIN.  What is the binding final price.  If you agree put down a deposit contingent on the answers to your questions being correct.
hmd69fx,GarnetSteel,11/27/2021,1,Tell me. If you have a ladder in front of you and each step is $200 but they’re 3ft apart (aka pretty hard to climb that ladder) or theyre $10 each and normally spaced. Which ladder would you climb? The one you can easily take step by step.  Approach your finances like this. Put your expenses on your debit have an auto payment set up to pay your cards. Whatever is more than the minimum. To earn good credit you’ll have to aim to pay the minimum before the due date and make an extra payment in between that and the bill posting date (if it’s zeroed then go buy a coffee to put some ‘funds’ on it in this time frame). The timeframe is about 3-5days. You can see both dates on the bill itself. Get a loan a credit line. These can help pay it off so you don’t get slammed with interest. As soon as we found a house I applied for a line of credit so I could do mortgage with improvements. The people financing us will pay me back once the improvements are complete. The MAX interest I have is 13% that’s better than 19 or 23% (cash forwarding).  If you’re in Canada your RRSP registered retirement savings plan can be directly used to fund a down payment with no tax penalties as long as you pay it back within 5yrs. I started with $25 a paycheque and managed about $2000 in 3yrs. Not the most ideal amount but since I’ve used it I’ve upped my payment to $50. 25 to pay back the principal and 25 to add more savings.  $10 $25. Whatever you could fathom spending on some junk food. Did you quit a habit that coat you money? Funnel that money into savings.  Every EVERY *every* **every** baby step of savings you put away adds up.  Start small. Don’t worry about leaping before you’ve walked.  Edited to add about line of credit. Speaking of. I applied for 10k
hmd0qtn,blablahblah,11/27/2021,1,On both the app and website click on Your TransUnion Credit Report right below the score then click on Accounts and Balances.
hma85ry,SilverTanager,11/27/2021,1,If you want to protect your family more without shutting down the business you should focus on improving your and your partners recognition of the LLC/corporate formalities.  Its not enough to just set up an LLC or corporation you also need to be careful to keep the businesss and your personal finances separate.  For example pay yourself a regular salary dont use the businesss bank account to directly pay your personal expenses or vice versa keep clear records of business expenses and make sure those are being paid through the businesss account keep the businesss assets in its name and your assets in your name etc.  States generally have a way--like an alter ego action--for creditors to ask a court to disregard the LLC or corporation and go after an owners individual assets if the owner didnt respect the LLC/corporate formalities himself.  By meticulously keeping your and the businesss finances separate you are more likely to have a court respect the existence of the LLC if you are sued and be able to keep your personal assets safe.
hmbv4xq,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1,Estimated tax payment isnt very helpful right now. You could increase witholdings on remaining paychecks for better results. Reason being is for estimated tax payments you have to calculate when you paid whereas with withholding it doesnt matter if it was early on time or late.  However dont stress it too much estimated tax penalty on $10k is like $175. Main thing is being able to pay the actual taxes by the due date.
hm8yswc,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,1,Yeah so I guess nothing short term then except kids. But we would still be living off my husbands income. That will remain our mindset forever. 1 salaried income household always.  Regarding the rental. Do you thinking upgrading to a DT rental for more cash flow is something to consider? Or should I be content and continue managing our rental and current home and focus on financial growth and savings?
hmaxyup,minnesotaguy1232,11/27/2021,1,Yes true. But depending on where it is sounds like it could be used for hunting. Hunting Land where I’m from (northern MN) goes for at least a grand per acre.
hmcwobs,1nd3x,11/27/2021,1,>Instead of paying 7% interest for several years you will be paying interest on that debt for 30 years.  Unless of course you double up your mortgage payments by the payments youd have made on the credit card...  cuz...in my example you were specifically approved for a mortgage with full knowledge of your debts so...your total debt approval is $550000.  you can buy a $450000 house and have $500000 in debt...or you can buy a $500000 house(that you were pre-approved for) and have $550000 in debt.  if you happen to go the $450000 house route then instead of having a $500000 mortgage which you have to pay $2000/month on **and** a $50000 credit card youre paying $3500/year in interest+principle on(and lets say thats $500/month)  You would still have a $2000/month mortgage(because its still $500000) but you could then throw the extra $500/month payments that youd have made on your credit card onto the mortgage instead as a direct only principle payment that would then reduce your total interest paid over time.  This is simply consolidating debt at a lower interest rate...considering your mortgage will probably lock in somewhere around 1.5-3.0% right now.  edit and if you decided to buy a $500000 home and just have a $550000 mortgage then sure you might have a $2200/month mortgage but you can throw the remaining $300 youd have put on the credit card that no longer exists against that mortgage and you will eventually chip away (and sooner than you would have with both debts individually) to the point where you have saved money on interest.
hm8x38v,gabrielcro23699,11/27/2021,43,I think the crazy thing about many Americans is - no matter how high their salary is - they will live paycheck to paycheck and use every single dollar they earn. Then even if theyre making $200k+ a sudden expense comes up and $50k is enough to relief it and theyre willing to take the risk.  I know so many American families living in $500k+ houses driving $70k cars and always being fucking broke at the end of the month. If a sudden minor bill pops up they go into serious stress-mode
hmcce6n,MXero1,11/27/2021,1,I agree with what everyone else said. The first things that came to my mind are  *What are you career goals? If you want to make a lot of money going to a non-profit will not help especially with a pay cut. You may put yourself in a spot where you are stuck in that salary range. Something to think about.  *Look into the courses. Gaining skills could really help.  *If you ended up training someone that could be something to add to your resume.

hmaa9o5,Sobutie,11/27/2021,1,Max out the 401k if you can. It will go so much farther now while you are young. Just make sure you understand that money is not to be touched. Ever. Not for anything.
hmc0lqh,soldiernerd,11/27/2021,1,Financially literacy is extremely low among poor people in the US. Additionally lots of people in poor communities are paid in cash by their employer to circumvent taxes. There is a distrust of the system as well which causes many people to keep their money under the mattress.

hm9uyra,RedalMedia,11/27/2021,1,Totally understand but is it smart? For a small $10 product people will choose Amazon over a random seller on the web because one assumes certain things about that smaller seller. Then why not apply similar standards for more important things in life?  If a parent will to ANYTHING to physically secure a child (from buying the highest quality feeding bottles to sacrificing everything to keep the baby safe) then why not apply the same thought process to the financial security of the child?

hmb7c0y,alto-sun,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for the kind and thoughtful response. I do stress a lot and am prone to anxiety and this affects my diet which may in turn affect my acne like you pointed out. Its funny you point out self-esteem being the root cause of all of this because I was thinking about it the other way around. It seems like it may actually just be a self perpetuating cycle.

hm9yejv,beets18,11/27/2021,1,I got Chase to Medallion Stamp my form back in April or so. The banker looked at it and I don’t think he’s ever seen that particular form. My only relationship with Chase is that I’m an authorized user on a credit card from them. Maybe they’ve changed their policy though with what is probably a huge influx of TD applications. Try other banks I guess but there’s also some online places that can do it for a fee.
hmc280d,Euphoric-Benefit,11/27/2021,1,What about auto pay bills that are done through a credit card?
hmcybi1,Pushmonk,11/27/2021,1,Depends on the store. Many places honor that for any reason because overall people dont use it. Then if you dont use it after a certain time it turns into store credit. Gotta find a less shitty furniture store.

That doesn’t include groceries or babysitters either so we spend too much on this stuff. But where we live is ridiculously high priced.
hmd81sr,Cowboywizzard,11/27/2021,1,It would have mattered. You dont pay for one preventative appointment per year.

I am planning on living in whatever home I buy for the rest of my 6+ years in the graduate program. If something happens that would require me to move (ex: if my PI moves to a different university I would have to go with him for all but the last 2 years of the program) would I be able to convert it to a different type of loan so Im not accidentally committing fraud or would I be forced to sell it / pay for housing in the new city plus a mortgage in an empty house?

hmacoi3,WolverineTherapy,11/27/2021,1,Thats why they sell homeowners insurance.  People need to live somewhere.  It makes more sense to own yours than to not.  Youre trying to convince yourself that you are more sophisticated than you are.
hm8zbe9,LookAroundAndViewIt,11/27/2021,1,If you are sure this is the place for you then go for it. If you don’t love everything about this place don’t do it for the FOMO.  It sounds like you have enough money and discipline to make it work. There is some more money coming in (raise/bonus/renter) that may help build up a bigger emergency fund for things that can go wrong when you own.  Maxing your 401k is great but if you cut back to contributing 10k a year for a few years and get to live where you want for the next 20 years will you be happier?

hmcyc21,ivanthemute,11/27/2021,1,First things first catalog everything.  Just like you said..  Denomination year type etc.  Having this will allow a valuation to run much more smoothly.  2nd check eBay sold listings for those.  Additionally for common coinage you can use Coinflation for melt value.  3rd search for a local coin store or club and get their valuations.  Tell them exactly what you told us you have no sentimental attachment but youre also in no rush to sell.  Ask them the retail price and what theyd pay you for them.  Let them know that you know they have a business and you understand.  A good honest coin dealer will be willing to tell you both.  4th decide what youre going to do.  Armed with the knowledge you pick up on your own and from others you can make that call.  As for the should you/should you not?  Im a fan of collecting and my go-to is no you shouldnt but thats purely of a personal preference.  You do you friend and good luck!
hma62ls,Earthquake14,11/27/2021,1,We’re basically looking for all of the above what you mentioned in a house. It’s just that with the cost increase the amount options goes up by a lot and the amount of “but”s goes down if that makes sense.
hm9n9iq,sir_richard_head,11/27/2021,1,First off they should not have done that.  If your balance was >$1k they were obligated to roll it into an IRA instead of cashing it out.  You need to contact them and tell them to fix this immediately because the amount was only under $1k _because_ they took out taxes.  You need a check for the full $1086.61.  Whether it is this check or the correct check open an IRA with a financial institution of your choice.  The type of IRA depends on whether you get this corrected or not.  You should be able to sign the check over to them directly but get their advice on it as every institution may want something different.  Some places may have a minimum balance to fund an IRA so you may need to combine it with a little bit of cash to meet a minimum.  You need to have the money in an IRA within 60 days in order for it to not count as a withdraw.
hma539w,football35249,11/27/2021,1,No that wont matter. Car is still in whatever state its in whether its in a tow yard or your driveway. A car being total has nothing to do with it being drivable or airbags deploying its just if the cost to fix the car is greater than the cars value.
hmckpcr,whyamilikedis21312,11/27/2021,1,$700-$800 could ** definitley** allow me to move out with a roommate close enough to local colleges too so my overall commute would be tiny. I wasn’t sure if that much rent was realistic given my income do you think it is?   How long do you think my income + $10000 savings would allow me to live in an apartment of this cost? I’d want to stay here for at least the first 2 years of college (I can take out a loan for the last 2)
hmafcmm,DiggingNoMore,11/27/2021,1,Except youre operating under the assumptions that: 1) theres a vesting period and 2) theres a 2% fee.  Neither of those are necessarily true.
hmayncq,HolyGig,11/27/2021,1,Yeah but you are just buying time you already have a finite quantity of. Take advantage and enjoy life while you are still young dont skip on going out with friends and family or taking a vacation here or there or ignoring your hobbies just to put a few more bucks towards your retirement.  Most people I talk to who plan to retire early plan to do so with a very frugal lifestyle. Man whats the point of having all that time if you have no money to enjoy it with?
hmcu3be,Chupoons,11/27/2021,1,Buy something pay credit card balance then get a refund. You would have to get the amount refunded AFTER you pay the cards balance for the month in which it was purchased.
hmcnfnx,StingrayRaider,11/27/2021,1,You can probably get a 2021 in February as well I’d personally wait and buy the car in Ca only because it seems like less work/time at the dmv.  What are tax savings? Anything less then $500 I’d probably wait to buy in Ca unless you need it sooner.

hm9w5dc,DesignatedVictim,11/27/2021,1,Do you have an emergency fund equal to six months of your expenses? If no I’d build that e-fund first then contribute to the Roth.   In theory you can contribute to the Roth IRA and consider that your e-fund but generally speaking the funds in that Roth should be invested aggressively for decades until retirement. Meanwhile it may not be prudent to invest one’s e-fund which depends on one’s financial situation and risk tolerance.  The other thing I’d consider is the monthly cost of the PMI and how soon you can remove it. Create an amortization schedule in Excel/Google Sheets and project when you will hit the LTV ratio that will allow removal of PMI using the current mortgage payment. Set up a second schedule with an additional $100/$150/$200 in principal paid. How much sooner will you get to PMI removal with the accelerated payments and how much more money will you be able to contribute to your Roth after the PMI is removed?
hmb7f4d,Whoz_Yerdaddi,11/27/2021,1,Do you have a car loan?  Also if do you get a secured card get one that reports to all three bureaus (there are cards that specialize in building credit) and keep a low balance.   Im thinking that you may have a thin file which is holding you back. Lenders like to see different kinds of loans on your report credit available to you but unused and a low debt to income ratio.
hmcxl8e,amberskye09,11/27/2021,1,From my experience  no not really. I got married to my husband in my parents living room and paid $50 to get my dad ordained so he could be the one to do it. He has a $30 wedding band and I have a $5 one that I bought at a comic-con convention.  Weve been married almost 5 years and lived together for 2.5 before that. Getting married didnt make anything any more expensive than it already was. Our lives basically went on as usual.

hmcxluy,droppedbits,11/27/2021,1,Cars and tailored suits come to mind.  Really anything customizable though where there’s a salesperson as a middleman.  Hard to discern between incompetence and malicious intent though. Usually if the salesperson is very sly and upselly malicious intent. Sometimes an honest mistake. Smaller the business (like mom and pop shops) more chance of it being a mistake because things can be much more fast and loose.  At the end of the day the advertised price is the advertised price. They can sell it for the price they advertised or choose not to sell it but shouldn’t bait and switch you.
hma566g,DiggingNoMore,11/27/2021,1,OP is 24 like it says at the top which you admit defeats your argument.

(and likely fucked to find another job).   ...whats next for Bank teller?  -- Not saying OP shouldnt report it but I would consider all those things as well.

hmcpowp,Fun_Personality1201,11/27/2021,1,Lenders take the mid score out of your 3 scores. They don’t take the high score not the low. The one in the middle. If there are two borrowers. They will use the lower of the two applicants “Mid scores”. Also to make matters more confusing a mortgage enhanced credit report/pull is usually different than what you will see as a consumer as your score.

You need something that says something like you have $300 per month budgeted on transportation and the running total is $1234.30 under budget.    Look at the budget on things you have some control over from both sides not just do I need to cut down spending to stay under budget but am I spending the budget I allotted.  Im generally a pretty frugal person (though you probably have me beat) so I sometimes find myself several months under budget in clothes or hobby categories of my budget so I have to remind myself to spend in those categories because thats what I told myself I would do.  For example thus far this year Ive spent about $300 on clothes but I have budgeted $600 for the year and my wardrobe is kind of wearing out.  I hate clothes shopping but its on my todo list to find myself a new pair of shoes and a better winter coat.  If I went years and years and consistently felt like I was spending too much on clothes to the point that I had too many and it got annoying then I would adjust my budget.  A budget you set yourself should not be a hard maximum to spend it should be an optimal amount to spend to maximize your happiness (or utility as the economist in me is screaming at me to say).
hmcyro9,iSOBigD,11/27/2021,1,Yeah being a couple is great financially as long as youre on the same page but its hard if youre not like if one person has terrible credit is bad with money or has a way lower paying job.  Overall the initial wedding and expenses can add up so it may or may not affect OP depending on their situation
hmc15u2,Agling,11/27/2021,1,Being married isnt expensive at all. Its cheaper than being single on a number of levels. Having kids is expensive. Also depending on how you do it the actual marriage event can be expensive. But those are separate choices from the actual choice to get married.  There are lots of ways to handle finance when you are married and everyone does it a little differently. There really isnt a right way. You just have to be compatible and be on the same page.  The other thing that is expensive is divorce. Make sure you arent setting yourself up for that. If you are confident then marriage is a wise financial move.
hm8ux5c,red5765,11/27/2021,1,Cool thanks for answering my question! Damn though actually Im looking at some things from FINRA and IRS and its kinda looking like I do need to keep my money there until Im 59.5 or leave the job... This is a complicated question.  Might ask a fee for service advisor about this one some time
hmawl9y,1hotjava,11/27/2021,1,Rarely does filing separately make sense. Ultimately we can’t say it’s too complicated and you really need to run the numbers both ways  What burns most people is that you two have to file either standard deduction or itemize you can’t file itemized and spouse file standard deduction. Plus tax rates are higher per person.
hm90mso,Syric13,11/27/2021,30,I understand the hesitancy in having someone losing their job but sometimes they dont deserve that job in the first place.  We hold certain people in our lives to a higher standard. This is someone who has access to a lot of your information personal and private and he is using that to ask for money. This is I dunno like a nurse who knows you got prescribed painkillers asking if she can have some because shes in pain.   What he did was a complete and utter breach of protocol trust and I might think even a little bit illegal. This isnt a small complaint. This is a major violation. I assume you have no personal or even business relationship with the teller right? He just happened to be the teller available at the time. I would look into moving your assets filing a complaint and blocking him on social media with a warning that if he ever contacts you again you will be going to the police.   This isnt a minor violation or something where he had good intentions. Hell when I worked at Blockbuster I had a coworker get in trouble because he was looking up movies a customer rented out just so he can strike up a conversation with her. And that is minor compared to knowing financial information knowing your name/address and asking you for money.
hmcwkjf,DoubleT_inTheMorning,11/27/2021,1,My wife and I lived together 2 years before we got married. I suggest this to everyone who asks. We found out *a lot* about each other the difficulty of living together sharing finances etc. it’s muddy waters when you finally test it out and I think it’s valuable to verify that you can actually stand each other on a day to day basis. You never know someone that well until you have to shit in the same bathroom as them on the reg.
hmd7mns,LegallyIncorrect,11/27/2021,1,You’re forgetting mechanic’s liens. In my state at least (and the other state in which I’m barred) those survive foreclosures as they’re superior to the mortgage even though that came before.  Also IRS liens and some other federal encumbrances wouldn’t be extinguished automatically.
hmbm7c0,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1,Keep credit utilization below 10% for the best possible scores.  Most banks only report your statement balance once a month so you would need to pay early to get a lower balance reported.  Also you should be asking for credit limit increase periodically. Goal for credit building should be to get limits high enough where your everyday spending represents no more than 5-9% of your credit limit. It sounds like your scores are fluctuating 20 points due to few open accounts and low credit limits.  Secured card is no different that unsecured card. You can get approved for plenty of unsecured cards with your credit history and theyll often pay you $200+ sign-up bonus.
hmbye87,MovieJunior,11/27/2021,1,Yes but traditionak index crowd are betting that the entire world economy is going to keep growing vs crypto and more speculative investors betting that a particular asset or company will keep going up.   It’s way more likely that the index investor will be right and find success and odds are if they’re horribly wrong that there the speculative bets wouldn’t fair any better and that they would be screwed regardless.
hmaua3j,ReaverKS,11/27/2021,1,There was a gas station at the intersection with footage. The police office reviewed it and put it in the crash report. The station wouldn’t let me see the footage tho
hma3hwh,HemingwayHuxley,11/27/2021,1,Yeah like I said there were some poor financial decisions that had led to the poor savings. My wife works for the govt and her coworker didnt pay anything out of pocket for medical expenses when she gave birth. I also shouldve mentioned $7000 in HSA. Im trying to fix the savings. What is a realistic monthly amount to save in our situation assuming that weve trimmed the monthly budget reasonably well ourselves?
hm93kc6,GiantRobotTRex,11/27/2021,15,Going up a tax bracket isnt a big deal. The higher tax rate only applies to the additional money you make not all of the money youve made this year.
hmc74nv,yellowcanvas,11/27/2021,1,I end up with a lot of unplanned expenses with food so I don’t know if I want to add to it. I’m 20 so I’m still learning to get a handle on things financially.
hmb6xbx,RO489,11/27/2021,1,Good luck! The marriage rate is declining so we need to adapt advice to adjust for the fact that more people will be entering into financial partnerships before or outside marriage. Instead of dont do it I think do it wisely makes more sense. My personal experience is my bf at the time (now husband) had the mortgage in his name and we divided expenses by income. Once we were married it became joint property.  Regarding money you cant take it with you. Im not trying to build generational wealth or retire at 40 so for me its a balance between a well funded retirement and enjoying the life I have now.  For what is worth at your new income that 401k tax benefit is going to be even sweeter (as will the mortgage interest deduction).
hm8wp22,assertivelyconfused,11/27/2021,1,I think you may have misread- his or her company only matches 50% up to 6%.  His or her fathers strategy only has him miss out on 1% free money or $520 per year.  Since his or her father presumably has access to the information we do not - interest rates living expenses vesting period 401k expenses 401k investment options - it’s hard to say that he or she should definitively contribute to 401k.     Post is not to disagree or present strawman argument just to clarify your post above as I am not sure the 50% match was factored into your rationale.
hmc5hvu,cosmos7,11/27/2021,1,Except no.  [Texas Title Insurance FAQ](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/title/titlefaqs.html): > Texas does not require title insurance. The lender will require you to buy a Loan Policy of Title Insurance to protect their interest.  Thats pretty much the same in every state... the lender wants to ensure that the collateral exists and no one else can lay claim to it.  But for a simple transfer without encumberance or lien there should be no real costs beyond the deed filing fee.
hmakyoc,lone_eagle54,11/27/2021,1,How soon are you planning on buying a house?  If its more than a year away you could transition some of your emergency fund to i bonds.  The money will be locked up for a year but after that the liquidity should be similar to the savings account.

hma66zd,tired_of_username,11/27/2021,1,The answer depends entirely upon how the stocks are held?  Are they in a retirement account or a standard brokerage account?  Big difference in tax treatment.  If youre talking about >$100k hire a tax adviser.  If less than $10k just do what they ask then close the account shortly thereafter.

hmcq479,ShovelingSunshine,11/27/2021,1,When you think of homes in your current range how do you answer the question How soon will we want to upgrade?.    Every 10k is typically another $50 on the mortgage.   We just bought a 240k home if there was a noticeable difference in what we got for 275k I wouldve 100% bought at 275k-300k.   Go up in price itll be fine.

hmak01j,kdavis37,11/27/2021,1,Two of my best friends are professional photographers. Both have found luck by being very specific in what they photograph. The one is a haunted house and RC car racing photographer. The other specifically does macro product photography. Both WILL do portraits weddings etc. but hate it.  The first actually worked for an architecture firm out of Atlanta for a while.  I wish that more art degrees (and arts degrees) included a bit of business with them.  As quickly as parts of Mexico are growing theres not any architecture work?  Are you in Mexico or the US since you mentioned immigration? I dont have contacts in Mexico but might be able to find something here

hmaetd5,FindFIREsomeday,11/27/2021,1,VTSAX is just a fund name.  You can buy it in a Roth IRA or in other types of investment account.  VTSAX is also the vanguard version of a total stock market index fund. If your IRA is with vanguard VTSAX would be great.  If your IRA is with Schwab youd want to figure out what Schwabs version is. Same is true for fidelity or other financial companies.  You might be charged a premium for buying the fund outside of their institution.  But they should all be pretty similar with low fees.
hmbs6p4,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,> This will be the second time theyve been sold to another lender.  OK they are not being sold. The Feds own and will always own them.  The Feds are firing some of these awful servicers and replacing them with hopefully less awful servicers. They are simply giving another company the pleasure of ignoring your calls and declining your desperate cries for help.    No change to your credit report.   I think Ive been changed about 6 times in my life.
hmbkfdr,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,Different scoring models from different scoring model development companies. Also in some cases exact update date (of what gets shown to you) may play a role. Both can be completely accurate.

hmc38lo,dirty_cuban,11/27/2021,1,It’s fine to hire your MIL as long as you also hire a component real estate attorney to handle the contract and communication related to the contract and contractual clauses. Even if it costs you $1000 it’s well worth having an attorney to make sure the biggest purchase you have ever made in your life doesn’t go south.
hmd4c5d,ghostboytt,11/27/2021,1,Plain and simple with the kind of money you make you simply cant invest in real estate in a meaningful way. MAYBE you can do house hacking with a low value property but you gotta be handy and have the time to fix it up yourself otherwise your capital will be eaten by repairs.

hmbqzrw,AGrainOfSalt435,11/27/2021,1,Is the annual income before or after taxes and retirement contributions? Just curious. Looking into possibly buying a house in the near future (next few years) but we do contribute quite a bit to retirement.

hmbfswe,cownan,11/27/2021,1,Thanks I appreciate the input. I do love to travel but I also have young kids (12 and 8) and as a single dad I dont know if Im ready to give up the safety of a regular paycheck. I also want to set a good example for them you know showing them a good work ethic. I dont think Id set a good example being the daddy that sleeps in late takes lots of naps and plays his guitar all day haha

hma28ka,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,I spent two hours this morning searching entry level jobs. Probably 80% of the ones I saw pay the same as what I make teaching preschool or just slightly more like $2 more. There were a few others like recruiting banking etc. but why would they hire me when I literally have no experience qualifications or interest in those jobs? I mean I could fake interest but Im also not a bubbly charismatic person who would be good at convincing people to buy cars or something like that.

hmcxmr0,Bryan995,11/27/2021,1,Then do it!  I wish I had stretched a bit more when buying a home. We bought a 1.2M home at 350k combined and it was easy to swing the payment.

hmcxzyr,lightnglass,11/27/2021,1,Im assuming you are fairly young are you around 18?  The reason I ask is if you are that young you really should not worry about having a perfect credit score now.  That is going to take a few years to build up.  What you want to worry about now is treating it responsibly (which you seem to be).    I got my first credit card when I was 16 (through my Dad) and have used them responsibly ever since I am now 36.  Use the card for small expenses pay off the card in full every single month - after a year or so get a new credit card (keep the old one) and charge different things to each card pay off both cards in full every month - rinse and repeat this over the years.  I currently have 6 credit cards - I use two for all my expenses (minus mortgage) and the other 4 I either charge 1 thing per month to or they are affiliated with a store I shop at semi-regularly and only use the card at that store for the points.  I pay all of them off every month in full.  I have a credit score above 800.  I pay off my car loans every month (and always have) I paid off my student loans already but back when I had those payments I paid more than the balance due every month.  To build a high credit score and keep it just means not having debt / paying off your debts in full each month.  Treat your credit card as a debit card and you will be fine.  If you use your credit cards in this manner the credit card company will be paying YOU money vs you paying them money (interest).  I have not paid for a airplane ticket in years due to my points on my travel credit card I am constantly getting free money to spend on Amazon from my Amazon card points.  You get the point.

That said if they intended to keep you at that pay then youre voluntarily giving it up.  If this were me Id pocket the difference. Id save it anyways so it would be there in case I needed to pay it back.  I might try to bring it up off-handed in conversation to see if any flags would be triggered. I definitely wouldnt ask them if Im being over-paid.

hm9kdyr,Snoo75172,11/27/2021,1,Is there any effect on your credit score(s) for long-term freezing?
hmcw63v,Jonko18,11/27/2021,1,The echo wouldnt be preventative care and since OP has a high deductible plan they must cover 100% until they hit their deductible which they havent. So no this wouldnt be covered.
hmd6yjd,Psychological-Cow-21,11/27/2021,1,Haha. Yes its rather comical. I dont plan on putting all 100k into crypto but divert a small percentage of that 100k to crypto and the rest to managing my own long-term investment into a long-term brokerage account. I have a Roth IRA a traditional IRA with rollovers from 401Ks from previous employers and 2 separate YouInvest accounts where I pick my own stocks. Thanks for the feedback!
hma1nxz,ricedt68,11/27/2021,1,Its a small amount of money and your tax penalty is only around $90 dollars so I wouldnt put alot of worry into.

hmafnbe,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,Houses come with a hidden liability: maintenance. You need to have an emergency fund that can cover an unexpected major expense or risk losing the house.    Thats on top of 3-6 months living expense.   If you dont have this make that your goal. How you do it is flexible. Can be any of/combination of: more work use more student loans roommate.   Being a landlord is a job you have all the liability in covering expenses (even more so it is a contractual obligation to maintain the habitability of the house) so if you dont already have experience with this and dont have guidance from family who have done this its risky.

hmasemw,BrockOli,11/27/2021,1,Ill still keep the position but i hope i have some leverage left to negotiate.
hma7k9r,flashgski,11/27/2021,1,Guarantee you will underestimate maintenance. Annual service on your heating system can be $200. Youll need to get yard care equipment which will need servicing if not electric. Repainting the house every few years plumbing issues etc.  It adds up and is not something you have to think about when renting. Id recommend putting aside another couple hundred a month for these things.
hmd5tzr,kaiserbun,11/27/2021,1,> The property doesn’t actually hold the account the person still does  Well for the gas companys sake I sure hope thats not true or that at least theres more to it than that. After my father died in 2018 PS straight refused to remove his name from the account and replace it with my mothers claiming that it was not necessary. I cant remember if my mother sent them a death certificate but tbh I dont think they wanted one. They refused to change the name on the account and continue to send bills addressed to him to the house every month.
hmbd41r,Abductedllama,11/27/2021,1,I switched within the last year from PNC to Chase. There really isn’t much difference between the two. One feature I missed from PNCs virtual wallet was entering checks into the system that would update your account. It was a nice quality of life feature that I don’t have in Chase (at least the type of checking I have).  I only switched from PNC to Chase because I was repairing my credit and really wanted specific cards from them. I figured building a relationship with them would help me get to the card I wanted and I have the card. So I guess it did.
hmd1br5,MDfoodie,11/27/2021,1,If you’re getting denied you must have some notable poor history that has you flagged. Banks are required to inform you of the reason. I suggest you find out why and attempt to get those issues resolved. Often going in-person to open an account leads to better success.  Not sure why an opening deposit is such an issue…often it’s minimal and that’s the point of having an account - to hold money.
hm9u853,swampler22,11/27/2021,1,If I decide to take the hit would that amount be due at tax time this upcoming tax season? (April 2022) and would that amount which Im estimating is around $236.00 be deducted from my federal refund?
hm9mzgh,decaturbob,11/27/2021,1, - this has a lot to do with age. If you are older you should have your credit frozen as being older you have way less need for credit than when you are younger.  There are always potential hazards with freezing and unfreezing credit across all 3 rating agencies.
hma31y2,HemingwayHuxley,11/27/2021,1,Already ahead of you on the Costco is awesome train. I was under the impression that it was better to save then pay off mortgage early.
hmcc5fg,Agling,11/27/2021,1,From what you describe there is very little difference in your financial outcomes from these two choices. This is really a question of which job you prefer. Forget the money and think of which job will give you better advancement and which you will enjoy more. If you take the lower paying job theres a good chance you can get advanced and be back to where you were or higher quite soon. Just make sure it really is a better opportunity in terms of what the job is and where it will lead you in the future.

hm9qb5c,roombataxi,11/27/2021,1,Its highly unlikely you will be able to get the money back but you have to call the bank and tell them the situation.

hmc08kc,GriffinTech1,11/27/2021,1,Keep your cards. Make a small purchase on them every couple of months to keep them open.  Your credit score is determined by the number of accounts you have and your average credit account history so by closing nearly all of them your credit score will needlessly drop. Just keep them hardly use them and let them age  Just don’t ever buy something you can’t pay off right there and now.
hmah8s6,cdbessig,11/27/2021,1,Hey I’m from nj.  You can be excluded from the mortgage but still be on the deed.  Meaning you own 50% and your husband owes 100%.  Source: me.  I did this in nj.  My wife did not have any credit and was a new immigrant and it was going to be a hastle to deal with getting her on the mortgage.  So we didn’t.
hmacrsb,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,Maybe it has to do with the lack of available checking account?
hmaqcbl,ronnevee,11/27/2021,1,Well if you get more pay you have more take-home. That its bonus pay doesnt change the scenario though since its taxed the same. I think entering your salary amount minus the pre tax deduction sand then just adding in the fica taxes mentally would be your best bet then. Smartasset would show your marginal fica rate on your last dollars to that would help.

hmcyhiw,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,3.5% down with a FHA backed loan for first timers. I would look into some robo advisor investment account with rebalancing offered such as SoFi or Betterment which will have a mix of stocks and bonds depending on your investing timeline goal.
hmb4lvl,ronnevee,11/27/2021,1,You could record this as compensation to him taxable to him but then a deduction for you. In order for you to deduct it he has to pay taxes on the value though. This would be a lot more complicated then just giving it to him though.
hmas9my,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,> But isnt the beauty of a Roth is that all earnings are tax deferred too.    Earnings are tax-free with Roth not tax-deferred....traditional = tax-deferred earnings.    That said the benefit stays the same as I mentioned because when you contribute with Traditional (instead of Roth) you can afford to contribute 12% *more* (assuming your tax bracket is 12%). That higher contribution means your money grows as a higher rate. So not only does Traditional = higher balance but the tax implications are still equal (in my example) *at worst*.    For example lets say you can afford to contribute $1000 and it grows at 7% for 30 years (somewhat conservative adjustment for inflation).    * Roth: $1000 contributed because its post-tax = $1000 less dollars in your pocket after 30 years @ 7% = $7.612.26   * Traditional: $1136.36 contributed pre-tax = $1000 less dollars in your pocket (if you didnt contribute this $1136.36 you would be taxed at 12% and only bring home $1000) after 30 years @ 7% = $8650.26    In both situations your net pay is $1000 lower than if you didnt contribute at all. With Roth you pay $0 tax so you have $7612.26. With Traditional you pay 12% (assuming the previous hypothetical situation). $8650.26 - $1038.03 (12%) = $7612.23 (the $0.03 difference is from rounding errors as I rounded to the nearest cent for each figure).    So even though Roth grew tax-free and traditional was only tax-deferred you **still** end up with the same amount if youre being taxed at the same amount...doesnt matter if youre taxed now or later.    But heres the thing if that $8650.26 was withdrawn as part of your standard deduction your tax-deferred growth in the traditional account is taxed at 0% which means your contribution to traditional came out to a *larger* number than it wouldve in Roth **and** cost you less in taxes.    tldr - If your highest tax bracket *during retirement* is equal or less than your current tax bracket Traditional will **always** be identical *or better* than Roth regardless of tax-free vs tax-deferred. The only time Roth is better is if the amount you withdraw during retirement from traditional accounts pushes you to the **top** of your marginal bracket *during contribution*.
hmar7b9,ArtLife8246,11/27/2021,1,Very good point. Sometimes that person-to-person call can yield some helpful info as well especially if the property is in a trust (and lists a name/s you are not familiar with) or in some instances if it is held by a larger holding company and you have no idea where to start in calling that person will usually know who in the area to put the call into.

hmawsbr,lcburgundy,11/27/2021,1,> Is it plausible for me to strive to purchase a house max price of 450K? Would it be recommended? I also have a partner who makes 38k yearly. In total our gross income is 98K.  If you have no other debt at all it may be possible but youd be approaching the high end of debt-to-income limits for conventional mortgages. If you have any other significant debt (student loans car loans CC debt)...then no.  ETA: Most lenders will not want to see you paying every last penny you have saved on a downpayment either. This is a default risk when the house needs repair or an unexpected expense pops up.  > I also have a partner  Dont buy a house with someone youre not married to. If youre not ready to be married to them youre not ready to buy a house with them.

hmagpl9,Default87,11/27/2021,1,an emergency fund needs to be available as soon as today so a savings account is the only logical place to keep it.  your house downpayment will depend on when it is needed.  if you are buying a house in the near term (about 5 years or less) then a savings account makes sense.  if it will be a longer time until you buy then market investments would be an option.  also I would recommend you dont think of these two things as a combined $60k.  you have an emergency fund that is $X and a house downpayment fund that is $Y.  buying a house is not an emergency so you wouldnt use your emergency fund dollars to buy a house.
hmc6bgs,redditornot02,11/27/2021,1,There is no methodology or tricks or tips or advice or workarounds or anything.   Here it is:   You get a credit card bill you pay it IN FULL before the due date.  This earns you cashback or other rewards banks don’t offer. For example my PayPal MasterCard Credit card is 2% cash back on every purchase anywhere. That’s actually quite significant in the long run.
hmd4gil,WeeniePops,11/27/2021,1,I would say absolutely. $30 a month is stupid cheap compared to most gyms and even though it may be a net loss on the money side investing in your health and well being is always one of the best things you can do for yourself. You will look better feel better have more energy and more motivation to go after your goals. I would always recommend a healthy diet and exercise regime as it will improve multiple aspect of your life and $30 is a very small price to pay for that. Besides whats the point of having money if you cant be healthy/live long enough to enjoy it? I say go for it.
hmac2dw,Riza101z,11/27/2021,1,Makes sense currently we both have no debt. The only thing we disagree on financially is credit and debt but he’s understood a few of the reasons I have credit cards now(but never paying interest). He more follows the Dave Ramsey approach to finances.
hmcdcb1,JhihnX,11/27/2021,1,Okay so you have no long-term savings right now and you’re expecting to average 45k pre-tax income for the next four years. You expect to save an optimistic $2600/year and you won’t be finished training for six years.  So you’ll be 23 or so before you’re trained as an electrician which is a job that averages in the high five figures expecting to make enough money to retire in 5-10 years? How?
hmc527u,Pharma_ham,11/27/2021,1,Im still on the fence about buying vs renting even though I could afford to buy. But what I like the most about renting is that you can just leave if things get really bad.  There could be very serious foundation damage water damage that can cost you 6 digits + months of time to repair but as a tentant you can just walk away from. Other things like a neighborhood or local economy deteriorating or even terrible neighbors can really mess up your life.

Worst case the convo doesnt go well and youre out a couple of bucks a paycheck.  The job market is hot right now so Id keep looking as well.  Id be surprised if you dont find an offer making more than you currently are.  From personal experience I dont tend to like non profits.

hmb3zc0,cahphoenix,11/27/2021,1,They did not. That is a common misconception. Clearances are paid for by the government.  Here is one source but if you search you can find many more. You cannot find sources that corroborate what you are saying. I was also employed at a couple federal contractors before moving to startups.  [https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs](https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs)  >How much does it cost to get a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL)?   >   >With very limited exceptions there is no direct charge to federal contractors for a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL). Government agencies receive appropriated funds to cover the cost of adjudicating security clearances and to pay an Investigation Service Provider like DCSA/NBIB for security clearance investigations. DCSA receives appropriated funds to pay for federal contractor clearance investigations and adjudications under the NISP. DCSA also receives appropriated funds to pay for security clearance adjudication for the military service departments and other DoD agencies.  Where ever you got that information it is almost certainly wrong as over 99% of all clearances are not paid for by the company (contractor). The company only incurs costs for maintaining the division/organization which keeps track of the clearances and clearance processes.
hmaks5f,styrofoam_cups,11/27/2021,1,If you stick to general funds/ETFs long term investing lowers the risk to pretty much 0. Has to be long term tho.   Completely understand your situation.

hmd5q9k,ScrapDraft,11/27/2021,1,This. Theyre called deferrals or extensions. They just move the payment to the end of your loan.  IF YOU TAKE THIS OPTION BE AWARE THAT SOME FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL NOT ALLOW AN EXTENSION/DEFERRAL IF THEY KNOW YOURE UNEMPLOYED.  Your best bet is to give them some other BS reason. You had an unexpected bill. Or medical expenses. You want to be able to assure them you can make payments in the future after the deferral or extension. Even if you cant. IF you tell them youre unemployed they may reject the extension request.  Other options include selling the car back to a dealer. If a dealer buys the car theyre essentially paying off your loan.  My suggestion. Call your financial institution. Let them know you may have problems making the next payment or two. Do not say youre unemployed. Ask them what options they have. Do not drain your savings to pay for this thing. Call them first.  Source: worked as a customer service rep for an auto loan company for 5 years.
hma5eam,rickybobinski,11/27/2021,1,Your car is totaled. The airbags alone will cost about as much as your car.  You need to have your car towed to a great body shop and let the other persons insurance handle. If they play around then lawyer up.

hmaqysb,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,I understand what youre saying and I appreciate the time youre taking to respond. Im not sure I would agree that 20% means youre absolutely sure and that anything less than that means the opposite. My husband and I have been together for 13 years come January. Well have been married for 3 lived together for 6 and were positive that buying a house together is the right step for us. But he was a child of divorced parents and my parents were not happily married despite being in a marriage until my mom passed in 2015. We have friends going through an ugly divorce right now as well. While I love my husband and neither of us can see getting a divorce anywhere in the future and I would say we have a healthy good marriage I dont think its unreasonable to ask what would happen with the mortgage if we were to ever get divorced. Youre correct that I have a lot more student loan debt than he does. To be fair up until we paid off all of our credit card debt in October he also had a lot more credit card debt than I did. Weve accepted our debt levels and I would love to pay more down on my student loans. That will be our goal after buying a house. I dont necessarily think its fair for him to take full liability on the mortgage or the full brunt of the debt to income ratio from it just because my student loan debt is higher. I was simply curious if it was a reasonable thing to do take myself off the mortgage for those reasons and what that would mean if things ever go south years down the road from now and we do wind up divorced.

hmae374,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,How would that work? Im just not getting this. Why wouldnt you max out a roth ira now at 12% when you could pyt more into a 401(k) when we eventually (ideally) just up a tax bracket? Why pay more taxes later on a 401(k)?

hmaepw0,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,This is fairly common. Happened to me also.    I think the finance companies do it to keep the dealers honest. In every scenario Ive seen it was the finance company yelling at and asking questions to the dealer.    Has anyone here actually seen financing get rejected after the car is already off the lot?
hmcyqaf,diatho,11/27/2021,1,No. Cards can be closed by the company for non use. There is also no benefit for you to get higher than 750.
hmd8lpr,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,> You have to be able to roll that after tax contribution out of the 401k and into a Roth IRA. Most plans don’t allow that.    Alternatively you can get close to this if your plan instead allows in-service conversions to a Roth 401k. My plan *does* allow that conversion so I can mega backdoor roth from after-tax to Roth 401k...when I leave this employer *then* I can roll over into a Roth IRA from there. So even if they dont allow in-service 401k -> IRA you might still be able to leverage mega backdoor roth.
hm9tz90,JKiesewetterPhotos,11/27/2021,1,The responsibility thing isnt an issue...and his new job is quite a good job. No worries at all about him being able and willing to pay us. Im leaning towards just keeping things as is for now. Much simpler as currently set up.

hman7ka,doktorhladnjak,11/27/2021,1,Very true. At least you can live in a house. It has utility beyond its monetary value.   I can’t find it right now but there’s an interesting paper about house prices on the Herrengracht in Amsterdam. This has been a prime real estate location continuously for over 400 years.   The authors found that over these very long timeframes real estate more or less matches inflation.   However they also found prices go in waves on long 50-100 year timeframes and short timeframes. Basically over 10 years prices may go up or down in a cycle (like the downtrend we saw around 2009 or many up trends) but across a 50-100 year window prices will consistently be above or below inflation.  We’ve been in a “beats inflation” mode for several decades in the US but this will probably eventually change to a “trails inflation” mode that will last several decades. This is likely connected to human psychology of a couple generations believing real estate is a good investment or just a place to live.
hmbs1a3,RO489,11/27/2021,1,Always use the 30/30/3 rule before buying a home during Covid-19 https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/09/10/always-use-the-30-30-3-rule-before-buying-a-home-during-pandemic-says-finance-real-estate-expert.html  Like all rules of thumb highly dependent on variables.

hmaerlg,Default87,11/27/2021,1,odds are there will be fees to sell the AF mutual funds when they are within the vanguard platform.

hmapv27,ATLiensinyosockdraw,11/27/2021,1,It’s possible the car will not be drivable after the air bags blow. Many have safety features that immobilize them after an accident during which the airbags deploy.
hmah973,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,Theres a book called Lifecycle Investing that is tangentially related to this. They show that by investing heavily early on you get a diversification benefit due to diversifying your exposure to the market over time. This makes your outcome more reliable and raises the lower bounds for what youll end up with.   Projecting 5/6/7 percent might be too optimistic. Were you projecting that 1.7M in todays dollars or adjusted for inflation? Global stocks returned around 5.2% adjusted for inflation since 1900. Presumably youll be adding bonds in at some point which will reduce returns at a time when you have the most invested. Further 5.2 is an average and there were many 20 periods where real returns were worse.
hmbes65,Nagare,11/27/2021,1,Not how that works unfortunately once you accept the hard inquiry and get approved then the damage is done and the new account is created. Your score wont drop any worse from closing it right away but itll still do the damage from inquiry and new account.

hmc8oja,moopuppy1995,11/27/2021,1,I HIGHLY recommend that you ALWAYS have a bank account in your own name that your partner does not have access to or maybe even knows about (depending on your situation). I am of the belief that a woman (especially a very young woman like yourself) should always have something in her own name that she can use to support herself. Not to say that your partner is a bad choice but you should always have an out if you need it. What with women typically being left in pretty crap situations if a relationship goes wrong be on the safe side.  To answer your question marriage does not really affect finances unless either of you have secret debt. Sure you get a tax credit but not really enough to make any significant difference.  Honestly I would recommend that you guys graduate move in together and figure out finances and stuff way before you get married. See how that goes for at least a year. And I would highly recommend that you do not join all accounts. I personally believe it is vital to keep some finances separate at all times.  &#x200B  Edit: grammar and additional paragraph
hmae19l,me_jus_me,11/27/2021,1,Yes and no. You just need to consider the ESG criteria. Not everyone has the same value system and the kinds of evil that tech companies are involved in is a little harder to pin down with objective criteria. But if you want to avoid fossil fuels guns and tobacco for example then the ESG funds do a good job of this. And you’re kidding yourself if you think that large companies don’t consider their inclusion in indexes and funds when making corporate decisions. This becomes more and more true the more popular that ESG funds/indexes get. Oil companies know there is no way they can be included but other companies with public profiles know they need to appease their shareholders and their image. Some of the more recent ESG efforts also involve getting positions on the corporate boards to help push the companies further with ethical practices.   So in summary don’t buy ESG if you don’t care about these issues but there are now some decent funds that resemble the broader market while excluding a number of obvious bad actors. And your investing decisions definitely make an impact on the world just like your choice to buy or not buy different products.
hmbgjtq,skiitifyoucan,11/27/2021,1,IMO spending more for the right house on the right neighborhood is probably worth it. Not moving for a long time is a good thing
hmaaa1t,Mikemtb09,11/27/2021,1,Of course speak to a lawyer first and there would be fees and transfer taxes depending on the value of the property but it can be “sold” for $1 and be a non-arms length transaction without major issues. People do this all the time in real estate. It’s just much easier than dealing with it after death.
hma78x3,football35249,11/27/2021,1,You should practice zero based budgeting. Every dollar from your paycheck has a purpose. Every line item in your budget should be accounted for. Youll know exactly what to spend on food to not live outside your means and know what area of the budget you can pull from if for some reason you go overboard.
hma9m8c,ThunderDrop,11/27/2021,1,The main drawback to an FHA loan is the mortgage insurance you will have to pay lasts for the entirety of the loan instead of eventually falling away when you reach 20% equity.  This means you will need to refinace at some point in the future to stop paying an extra $200 per month.  Or move of course.  This sounds like a good situation for a starter home anyway.  Those dont really exist anymore but you can get more home for your dollar moving into a lesser school district and just plan to move in five years time.

This is for your own protection. Theyll only mail checks to you so if anyone tries to steal your 401k by performing an unauthorized rollover youll see it in your mail.  > then went through HR because I’ve never rolled over a 401k before and needed guidance on how to go about doing it.  Provider B should have an address to receive rollovers. You could have sent it via certified mail with return receipt.

hmacu9q,RO489,11/27/2021,1,I think you should bump up that 401k. As others say houses come with more expenses than renting.    And ask that being said I dont think theres anything wrong with lifestyle creep. Isnt that kinda the point of earning more (unless youre a FIRE early retirement type)? Some the housing market is high I would buy a house you are comfortable to say in for 5-10 years. Following the 3x salary rule you should be comfortable increasing a bit but that depends on your other spending habits whether you plan to have kids (and whether youll have daycare expense or drop to a single income) etc.   The point is that your spending should match your priorities. If you enjoy travel and eating out or expensive hobbies you probably dont want to stretch for your mortgage.   Regarding the dont buy a house with gf just make sure you are clear on how rubs will be divided if you have to sell or break up and how expenses will work. You might want to get an attorney involved just to formalize things
hm8ujxj,QuitProfessional5437,11/27/2021,1,Even better. OP can fill it out and then leave
hm91kqk,BankEmoji,11/27/2021,47,Would you rather fire one criminal or arrest the entire fraud ring all at once?  It should be obvious that if a criminal is being watched that we would have more than enough evidence to reverse any damage they have done or… pretend to be new victims.   If you have a wasp problem it’s better to find the nest. Otherwise you’re just running around fighting individual wasps every day.

hmb8slk,jailguard81,11/27/2021,1,If you buy a house your living expenses will go up. So budget accordingly. u have to pay all the utilities maintenance upgrades they add up very quick. and then buying a new house you will be buying new furniture appliances. So make sure you factor all that in when u budget.
hm9xaq2,UMfan11244,11/27/2021,1,Got it. So as long as you understand that you’re good.   My priorities would be…  1) get employer max 2) max out both Roth IRAs 3) increase 401(k) contributions
hmd41rs,1hotjava,11/27/2021,1, >then maxing ira (as my gross income would be reduced) and then once I hit the limits for the year contribute some money after tax to a Roth IRA   The max you can contribute to an IRA is $6k/yr. that’s combined between traditional and Roth so if you max the traditional IRA at $6k you are done with IRAs   >backdoor Roth IRA.  Backdoor Roth is for people who make too much to contribute to a Roth IRA. It’s not a way to do more IRA beyond $6k. Even when doing a Backdoor Roth you are still limited to $6k
hmbdssa,trekologer,11/27/2021,1,Ok they only took a couple months to notice. Still doesnt give a lot of confidence that the landlord has good record-keeping.   The fact that the bank has no record that the check was cashed means that the check wasnt cashed. Im not letting the bank off the hook that they didnt actually send the check either. The bank should cancel the check and either send a new one or return the money to OPs account.
hma6ivv,S_Baime,11/27/2021,1,Early in my career I started putting 7% in my 401k.   Every time I got a raise half of it went into my 401k until I was putting in 18% plus the company match.  I did this on advice from my boss who was a good mentor to me.  I never missed what I didnt have. It worked out well.   Take care JP  FYI: At one point I reduced my 401K  down to 5% and put the difference into a Roth.  I was shocked how much went to taxes instead of the Roth.  I stopped doing that.
hmblper,Undercovergreen,11/27/2021,1,Youre concentrating on the wrong numbers. The insurance company isnt concerned with you paying the value of the car.
hmd7nek,Psychological-Cow-21,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for your thoughtful and descriptive response. Those are all important questions that I continually ask and reassess.  My house is paid off so I dont have to worry about mortgage.  My roommate covers my utilities. I dont have a monthly car payment. I make a 6 figure salary.

hma2fqi,Pretty_Swordfish,11/27/2021,1,This at least put some of your raise into retirement especially if you arent maxing out your accounts yet. After that if you can carry the more expensive house on your own go for it. But keep in mind extra costs. My house mortgage payments are mandatory of $975 a month but total costs with all utilities ends up closer to $1800!! Houses are way more than just the mortgage.
hmacljs,Bert_Skrrtz,11/27/2021,1,You should aim for the 50/30/20 rule at a minimum.  We make better money but live in a very high/mid COL area and have managed to hit 50/20/30 (so more to savings than wants).  I’d recommend YNAB as well. It’s a total game changer when you stop spending money you don’t have yet.
hmafp0u,zludderz4707,11/27/2021,1,That’s exactly the question I asked myself when I got this call - why let the risk roll off the lot before you even obtain the profits? Granted I was at a dealership that had papers signed and cars sold every 5 minutes.

hmalsyr,_releaf_,11/27/2021,1,Thats good thats just investing. DCA means that the longer you do what youre doing the more beneficial your investment will be not just because youll have more money in the account but also because the cost to youve paid to buy your investment over the years will average out and be less volatile.  I think youre making it more complex than it needs to be! Just buy something that youre comfortable with and hold for as long as possible. Then keep doing that easy as pie!
hmapr7f,levans1717,11/27/2021,1,Land is absolutely one of the best things you can own especially with the low property taxes. That wetland might not be wetland later down the road but even so hunters might be interested in leasing it especially if it connects to conservation land.
hm9o3r5,12hourslater_0,11/27/2021,1,4 years active duty at your age is perfect. I did the same thing and now Im out. I own a house make over $100000 a year at 24 years old. The clearance with most jobs is great and the GI bill can help bridge the gap without the debt when you get out.
hmcc2a1,Appropriate-Yam-1160,11/27/2021,1,You have to be bold - Kanye crazy sometimes because you may be surprised what can be offered. For example I was offered $130/hour a couple years ago and that was $30 more than I was making at that time. I knew that this company was desperate so I asked for $160 thinking that if they come back with $150- I’ll be happy.  That project ended up lasting almost one year (and I was paid $150/hour or $12000 every two weeks). Fast forward to 2020 - I had to take something that paid under $100/hour and I did it for a while. A new opportunity came up and being bold - I asked for $150 “at a minimum”.  I’m now making $160/hour. Granted it’s only for 8 weeks but it’s a nice bump from where I was just a month ago and now I’m hoping to keep this higher rate as a bar.
hmbpg8a,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,This. We dont lower pay if we drop your job title.   I guess because dropping wages comes with too much HR legal risk.    We might hate you and think you are too expensive for your new role and refuse to give you a raise in the future and look to lay you off in the future.... But we wont bring the salary down.
hmb62h8,NewlyMintedAdult,11/27/2021,1,Here are some approaches that may be worth trying.   * Think in terms of spending time rather than spending money. For example if you earn $20/hr picking up those fresh strawberries might be worth 15 minutes of work-time rather than $5. * Think about certain types of spending as investments. You arent just spending money - you are buying health or life satisfaction or experiences or what have you. * Decide on a threshold below which worrying about money doesnt make sense to you. Anytime you find yourself dealing with differences smaller than that threshold tell yourself that youve ALREADY decided not to worry about it. It doesnt matter if you could have gotten a better deal somewhere else or dont *really* need whatever the item in question is or whatever other doubts you make have - even if the doubts are correct youve already decided that the money in question isnt worth worrying about. * Go over your finances and decide on some amount of $/week that you would be comfortable spending on frivolities. Then if you are worried about whether a purchase is justified you can choose to pay for it from that budget and dont need to worry about justification that money was budget for literally whatever so you can spend it here guilt-free.

hm8uhgx,savagemonitor,11/27/2021,14,Ill have to ask my family as they were in banking for decades at all different sorts of levels short of executive.  I would be a little surprised if it didnt happen but back then Im betting that people did things like steal from the till or short change customers they thought wouldnt catch it.  Mainly because Id have to think that was easier than trying to randomly reach out to a customer since that was harder.  Today though most deposits are likely done via machine (either ATMs or computers) so the tellers dont have the same opportunities they did in the past.  Mix that in with the begging culture that companies like GoFundMe have fostered and the people that had no qualms about stealing back then are the ones that are trying to rip off customers directly now.

hma8xim,ZenGuruji,11/27/2021,1,I know everyone here is suggesting a budget but that would drive me mad.  What I would suggest is to simply pay off your bills and pay yourself for investing and savings and then just set aside the remainder to spend on yourself. If you end up not spending a lot no worries -- just the throw the remainder into savings or investments.  All these budgeting apps and spreadsheets would drive me mad. Its like counting calories when youre trying to lose weight. It works but usually also leads to headaches.

The lease document does not clarify the exact formula other than: sub-metering of all electric/water use and that 3rd party billing company if applicable: Conservice.  However at least it seems clear that my usage is not based on number of persons residing/occupancy/size of the unit (it is a small unit anyways)  In my lease document all it says regarding utility bills are the following:  water/electricity bills will be billed by the service provider to us and then allocated to you based on the following formula:1  Metering/allocation method key  1- Sub-metering of all of your water/gas/electric use  2- calcuation of your total water use based on sub-metering of hot water  3- Calculation of your total water use based on sub-metering of cold water  4- flat rate per month  5- Allocation based on the number of persons residing in your apartment  6- allocation based on the number of persons residing in your apartment using a ratio occupancy formula  7- Allocation based on square footage of your apartment  8- Allocation based on a combination of square footage of your apartment and the number of persons residing in your apartment  9- Allocation based on the number of bedrooms in your apartment  10- Allocation based on a lawful formula not listed here.

Of course this is speculation. But OP mentioned $25/yr in property taxes so it wont really cost much to simply sit on it.

hmdakzz,kindrudekid,11/27/2021,1,They frequently run 0 fee promotions.  Currently I have 0 fee on my delta platinum and bonvoy cards for any plan I create before year end. Guess which card Im using for bf and Christmas shopping. And when I created a plan it gave me option to pay it off in 24 months. If you login you should see that in your offers.  Before that I had it on my blue cash. I put my entire 4k PC build on this and Im paying it off over 24 months.  I had same on my platinum too but never used it but I called and requested if they have any other offer and they offered 4%. It was worth it to add a shit ton of purchase before they devalued transfer to Schwab. The platinum one wouldnt let me setup more than 6 month plan.
hmaa1l0,6553321,11/27/2021,1,The bank is saying the check was cashed. Because theyre saying if the check was not cashed the money would have been put back into the account. With a filed police probably can make better progress.
hmdavuq,DarklightNS,11/27/2021,1,I remember in our case since they were successful they thought they can just ask for anything and get through with it. The owner of the company was a Lawyer - they lost in court - because they basically not only had no legal foundation but also made blatend obvious mistakes like using wrong dates on the paperwork.   Long story short just because they seem like they know what they are doing or they confidently write some random fantasy legal documents doesnt mean they actually do and are in the right to send those. - Goes for a lot of people in a lot of professions and businesses.
hmam5zr,93195,11/27/2021,1,I wouldn’t turn your nose up at your MIL’s house if I were you.  If she’s willing to gift you money I assume she’ll also give you the “family price” on the house.  There’s also no realtor fees (a 6% savings right there) no bidding war in an overheated market no moving no nothing.  Even if you want to move in a year or two if you got the “no realtor family price” you’d still come out way ahead.  You live there now.  How bad can it be?
hma29pt,wickedkittylitter,11/27/2021,1,Youre behind on savings.  A total of $27k in retirement for a couple of 30/32 year olds is low.  And if your only other savings/investments is $10k youre even more behind.  Before you plan an international vacation for 2022 check with your insurance plan(s) to see how much of the cost of pregnancy/birth/after care you will be responsible for paying.  You may find that youll need to use the $7k to pay for the baby rather than take a vacation.  Its all about priorities and which is more important.  Posters here are good at pointing out where improvements can be made in budgets so list all your income and all your expenses and youll get good suggestions on how to cut your budget to save more.
hmcvjdk,SteeztheSleaze,11/27/2021,1,You’ve gotten a lot of feedback but as others have said for one dual incomes make a huge difference.   I can’t afford to live alone in my hometown. When I had a girlfriend we split rent and did pretty well. Then if we got married she could use my insurance and we’d save on that unless hers was better then I could help pay for my share on hers. Then there’s tax benefits etc.   You don’t have to go crazy with a big wedding if you don’t want to. A lot of my friends got married on paper then had a wedding once they and their families could afford it. Just a thought
hmae5a0,FindFIREsomeday,11/27/2021,1,In my opinion you missed a few steps. But personal finance is personal of course.  My thoughts:   1. $1000 or $2k buffer 2. Company match for 401k 3. Actual emergency fund 4.  HSA (if applicable) 5. Roth IRA ($6k/ person) 6. Max 401k  ($19.5k $20.5k next year for each person with a traditional job) 7. Maybe house? But probably non tax advantaged investments would be better.    Mortgage rates are insanely low currently.  If your rate is 2.5% to 3.5% youre really not giving yourself much of an advantage by paying it off early.  Thats below current inflation.
hm9ryw3,yut777_,11/27/2021,1,I am in fact not paying taxes. My income would probably be too low but doesnt justify this nonetheless

hmbhzyc,phantalien,11/27/2021,1,Dont get married yet.  Move in together and see where it takes you in a few years.  It also gives you a few years to find that job and where that may take either if you.  Money is one of the biggest strains on relationships along with sex and children.  You are thankfully young.  Enjoy yourselves together for a bit before life changes and you become an adult doing adult stuff.
hmanwl1,123456478965413846,11/27/2021,1,Only lawyer up if the other partys insurance fights you on paying AND you have injuries.  It is definitely not going to be worth paying for a lawyer to fight insurance over the payout on property damage alone on a car worth 4-6k.  And you will not be able to get a lawyer to take it on contingency without personal injuries so you will have to pay upfront.  You might not even be able to find a lawyer willing to take your case at all if it is just property damage.
hmcxgk5,UGA10,11/27/2021,1,It could potentially be money laundering so its 1 of the reasons that a credit card company will not allow it.  Overpay the credit card from 1 source request a refund check from credit card company take refund check to a separate financial institution and you now have clean money. A check from a valid financial institution is not very suspicious.
hm8uf76,kbeezie,11/27/2021,3,Pending someone with much more experience chiming in. The route I would have taken is disputing the charges with the bank with PayPal being uncooperative in addressing fraud/theft which might lead to some movement on PayPal side (usually they start with locking your account as a response and going from there).   Because the way I would word it with PayPal is that they helped facilitate criminal activity by failing to respond to a complaint of breach on their end the time wasted likely also means the impossibility of getting the money back.  Since bank transfers tend to take days (held in PayPals system before being deposited on the other end) they were at the most effective stage to stop it if you contacted them the day the money was requested to be pulled out of your account theyre also in the best position to identify which accounts the money was being paid to. If nothing else might escalate to a higher tier of support.  Can probably look into a formal BBB complaint at the same time though they are not required to respond to mediation by them.
hmbbs61,Pleasant_Carpenter37,11/27/2021,1,Counterpoint:  Paying extra on the mortgage merely reduces the principle owed it doesnt prevent a foreclosure in the event of a job loss.  An extra $150/month will shave about 5 years off a mortgage so the job loss risk is still there for nearly 25 years instead of 30.  Your suggestion would save people who bought in the early 90s from losing their house in the Covid recession assuming they hadnt lost their house in the dotcom crash or the Great Recession.  IMO better advice would be to put that extra principal payment money into a HYSA or I-bonds for ~10-20 years instead then make a balloon payment when you have enough to end the mortgage.  In an emergency youll have part of that mortgage-buster fund available to keep making mortgage payments.
hma1c5a,my_new_throwaway106,11/27/2021,1,Thanks.  We each have retirement accounts but what I gave is the total.  My spouses income is rather small currently about $20K per year part time work while shes been focusing on other things.   Once the real estate gets back on track the two that we have will give about $2500 per month in additional income above the expenses.  COVID put a dent on the plans to raise the rent as a tenant who was projected to move didnt and the other tenant also got behind on rent.  We are waiting for a $8K check from the government to cover that.  They are both in areas where the rental market has gone up substantially but we cant raise the rent where we want it until we get new tenants.   I dont recall hearing that particular number before the 6x salary by the time youre 50.  Thats a solid chunk of change and we hadnt been shooting for that kind of goal.

OPs potential rental passes the 1% rule has a cap rate of ~8% and cash on cash return of over 40%.  Do this with 3 rentals and your investments are earning what a fulltime minimum wage worker earns in a year. Plus the equity thats building up.
hmaniwa,wild_b_cat,11/27/2021,1,The simplest way to build a portfolio is something called the 3-fund model:  [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund\_portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)  The idea is that you want to diversify into as much as possible.

A Roth IRA will grow tax free and is tax free on withdrawal in retirement.  You can only put in $6000 per year per person though so you will still have a brokerage after that.  Also Congress is trying to do away with the backdoor roth so keep an eye on that.    3.  Id probably lean towards getting out of debt too so you arent alone in that mindset.

hmawn49,Rubily00,11/27/2021,1,0% Apr credit card is not bad as long as you can guarantee youll pay it off completely before the 0% expires.  For most people getting a personal unsecured loan for $10k will be difficult if not impossible. And even if you can the rates are not likely to be as favorable as a loan thats backed by an asset. So if a 0% card doesnt work for you a home equity loan is probably your next best option.

hmbhnbd,red_river_wraith,11/27/2021,1,Most people dont understand the long term drag of fees over time.  Investment costs and advisor fees may seem miniscule at first blush however over time they compound just like your investment returns.  Not only do you lose small amounts from fees but more importantly you lose all the growth potential that you might have had for years into the future due to fees.  Find an online investment calculator and input your data with and without fees over a 20 or 30 year period I think you will be shocked at the difference.

hmbzvr3,soldiernerd,11/27/2021,1,Credit card transactions arent settled instantly - they are authorized instantly (which you can see in your bank account) and then a capture request is issued to move the funds to the vendor. Those captures are batched out nightly (typically).
hmcvr0x,classicalL,11/27/2021,1,Normally it is a 403B that is after tax and not a 401K. But the result is not distinguishable from a 401K. Lots of non-profits have two 403B accounts one for your tax advantaged stuff and one for anything beyond that you elect to put in and their contributions. That separates out how they have to be taxed when you withdrawal assets better because taxes have been paid on one blob and the other they have not.

hmbs7mb,Icy-Regular1112,11/27/2021,1,I think you misunderstand insurance. The liability for you damaging someone else’s car or worse hurting or killing someone while driving is many many times more expensive to insure than it is to just replace your car. The cost of the car has some bearing on how much it costs to insure but if you car cost $1 you’d still pay the big bucks because any accident you might be involved in could mean huge medical bills or (unfortunately) paying a death benefit.
hmam1km,lcburgundy,11/27/2021,1,I live in a low food cost area but $2.3k/month seems very high to me for that family size.

hmcmh38,dlpfc123,11/27/2021,1,I like the idea of accounting for maintenence when planning for a home. You never know when an emergency repair may be needed. But I dont know anyone who consistently pays that much in maintenance unless they purposely bought a fixer uper. I tend to think of maitence more as a fund you build up before buying then maintain and dip into as needed rather than a consistent monthly expense. But maybe I am just jaded because I am a renter who has for sure payed more in maintenance of the home than my landlord does. Man I cannot wait to be a homeowner.

hmavuvq,wanttostayhidden,11/27/2021,1,How much will you actually make between 1/1/21 and 12/31/21? That is what you use to determine eligibility not what your current salary is.
hmbkyvj,CQME,11/27/2021,1,Ok...lets give this a shot.  Just FYI things may change depending upon where you are in the country.  Right now youre paying $1500/mo period.  Youre looking for a condo with a $1100/mo mortgage.    Add taxes and insurance lets say 1% property tax and $1000/yr insurance youre looking at around $3500/yr about $300/mo.    Add HMO lets say $200/mo.  Right now for this condo youre looking at $1600/mo and thats not including utilities or maintenance.  [This is a fairly good list](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/mortgages/expenses-of-home-ownership/) of what to expect outside of the mortgage.  They put in closing costs/escrow prepaids/mortgage points in there which is kind of silly since all that is part of the check you cut when you give the down payment but the rest of the list is pretty solid.
hmc7v6t,j-christopher,11/27/2021,1,I get it.  The last thing you want to do is look at a credit card as a way to carry debt.  If you pay in full every month by the due date there is no balance to which an APR can be applied.  I have more than 25 credit cards and couldnt tell you the APR on any of them.  What I *can* tell you is which one I use for which type of purchase to maximize the rewards *they pay me*.  I never really was a balance carrier but I have left a ton of money on the table in my lifetime by either using debit card (BARF) or putting purchases on shitty rewards cards.
hmc8m4u,thc1967,11/27/2021,1,Depends on who youre leasing through. Check your paperwork for terms & conditions of an early buyout. If youre happy with those contact the leasing company and ask for the buyout price. If youre happy with that do it.  Theres not really a downside if you want to own the car... again depending on the leasing companys early buy policy.
hmcle4e,Iammine843,11/27/2021,1,I thought because of the banking regs a 1099 needed to show 3 years of income with tax returns or something.  Have you tried SoFi or a mortage broker?  Its doable just more paperwork for you and possibly more money down than a traditional mortgage.

hm8x59v,okaywhattho,11/27/2021,146,Is this seriously how it works in the real world? It sounds like something out of a movie.   Surely OP’s bank teller is already committing some crime? Or at least some breach that allows them to be both fired and blacklisted from working in a bank ever again?   It feels a bit shitty to allow someone to fall victim to this and only then react to it. Sure all of the money can be recovered but it’s just unnecessary stress. Maybe I’m just naïve.
hmd2eis,I__LOVE__LSD,11/27/2021,1,I was reading in the WSJ the other day that its something like 8% of Americans that max their 401k contributions. So its not an issue for most people for sure but definitely something that a decent portion of people need to take into consideration.
hm8z3zu,Mental_Tax_2653,11/27/2021,2,I think it really depends on where you live. Mobile home are like cars in that they are SUPPOSED to depreciate. However I have witness in my market mobile homes have been going up in prices in the past 6 years. My in-laws bought a double wide for 40k in 2015 and everything double wide around them is selling over 100k no land just the trailer.  Now with that being said I would proceed with caution as they are harder to finance and insure. Also the rent price on the lot affects how much or if they appreciate.

hmaxbq3,ricksebak,11/27/2021,1,I write this with the assumption that you’re looking to programmatically analyze your own data for your own personal benefit as opposed to programmatically analyzing data for a fintech startup that you are starting…  With that assumption in mind I suspect that what you’re looking for doesn’t exist. I’ve looked around myself and haven’t found anything. It’s not really in the interest of a bank/broker to offer API access to its customers because doing so is 1) a lot of time/money 2) a liability that their compliance team doesn’t want and 3) won’t gain them any significant amount of customers because very few people even know what an API is and even less people will switch banks based on API’s.   There are API’s that offer the kind of data that you’re looking for such as Yodlee (which is what Personal Capital uses) but they’re marketed to FinTech’s not consumers.  Probably the best way to programmatically access your own data would be browser scraping (Selenium or whatever) rather than a proper API.

hmbbthb,CQME,11/27/2021,1,>investing probably makes sense.  Im of the opinion that investing in something like TIPS makes sense...but if anyone is going into the stock market they need to understand that the stock markets performance over the past 12 years or so to say nothing about its performance since the early 80s is way above average.  Law of averages reversion to mean whatever you want to call it would dictate that in order to average out this multi-decade boom will have to be tempered by a multi-decade decline.  There have been several of these over the past 100 years so its certainly possible and we are long overdue for one.  The return on TIPS is probably going to be around where mortgage rates are today maybe a bit lower.  Its a better alternative to cash and it allows you to take advantage of current mortgage rates without getting hit too hard by inflation.

hma1iet,Dignam3,11/27/2021,1,Sounds like he wants you to have an emergency fund first which is good.  But IMO you are leaving free money by not contributing up to max match.  Note the following is not ideal: but you \*can\* use your 401k (vesting dependent of course) for an emergency until your more liquid cash fund is big enough.  You will pay a early withdrawal penalty but you can do it if absolutely necessary.  I dont think your dad is wrong necessarily but if it were me I would most definitely contribute 6% first then focus on e-fund and loans.
hm8uz4f,assertivelyconfused,11/27/2021,33,$50k in gains?    If so that makes quite a bit of sense.  A low effort $50K at 20% is a useful bit of change either for a luxury purchase or compounding interest in the future.    As an aggressive saver I’m able to save $36k/yr in a $140k/yr job.  The idea of making that in an instant?  Attractive.  Ppl sometimes forget how much stress jobs have at this pay range.  I also do not know if I can do this much longer much less forever even when pay increases are involved.    Anyway integrity matters to me so I’d never do such a thing.  I am also glad this guy got caught.  I can understand why he may be tempted tho.    What I really don’t understand are the six-figure gov’t employees who sell secrets for $6000.   Sometimes it’s bc of ideology or ego and not money - but still - those aren’t mutually exclusive.    Anyway glad those ppl get caught too.

hm9j77r,PersonalBrowser,11/27/2021,1,It’s definitely better to have multiple accounts. The person recommending a single account is factoring saving a couple minutes of setting up the account over everything else including being able to take tax advantaged distributions down the road since the account can only have one beneficiary.   On top of that most accounts these days allow you to have an external link for family and friends to gift money to the 529. So it’s helpful for the kids to each have their own.  Also people say that you can change the beneficiary no prob and that’s true that you can absolutely change it but in my experience it’s an annoying process and takes time and a hassle which outweighs the ease of having a single account.    It also helps you keep track of whose money is whose. For example when the kids are in high school if they work and put money into their 529 but the single 529 is for three kids then are you really going to be tracking how much of the account is whose and calculating the individual investment growth and returns of each kid? Doubt it.
hmd3cr3,Jorycle,11/27/2021,1,Cant tell if theres some degree of sarcasm here. Or sardonicism. There certainly should be.

hm9stvh,dadading_dadadoom,11/27/2021,2,Then likely they did a withdrawal. Maybe they have a less than $1000 policy.    Option A is to rollover you need documentation add exact missing amount to move to IRA within 60 days. At tax time net the tax amount (since tax on 401k already withheld you can expect that to be credited).  https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/rollover-faq   Option B is to take the hit penalty is 10% + calcated tax.

hmapsiv,MFSHou,11/27/2021,1,Be sure to check your bill against your Explanation of Benefits (which is a document that your insurance company will send to you after any claims are filed on your behalf). The EOB will tell you for sure what was paid by your insurance any charges that are discounted or are not applicable under the contract and what you may owe.  A lot of providers will try to talk you into taking any money owed to you as a credit towards future services. Up to you whether that’s acceptable or not.
hma7m5j,Frozenlazer,11/27/2021,1,You need to talk to an attorney . Or at least whatever type of professional deals with these things in your country. In the US it would be an estate planning attorney.  You are likely going to run into the need to reconcile the laws of the different nations at play here.   In the US at the most basic level trust funds are about how the account is controlled. From there what the trust does is only limited by the law and your willingness to spend money on lawyers.it could be as simple as cash in a bank account or as complex as shares in a company owned by a private indivudyal that have a pre determined valuation schedule etc with 10 pages of limitations on how and when the money can be used.  For most families the value of a trust is related to control. For example an 8 year old has no business inheriting 200k directly. A trust can direct how that money is spent. And thats what most people use a trust for. The other value of a trust is usually related to the tax treatment of the money in the trust. In the US gift tax laws are related to the value of the gift when it is given  so if I give you shares in a shell company that are basically worthless now Ive not given you much of a taxable gift. But then if those shares are worth 10M when I die and you get control then Ive avoided making a taxable gift . ( That is a dramatic over simplification)  Source wife is estate attorney.
hmbfrqt,ExpensiveCategory854,11/27/2021,1,Aren’t all investments speculative to a point?  Why do hedge funds exist if it’s such a sure thing?   I get there’s a lot more volatility in crypto but compared to the stock market it’s extremely young and expected.    I feel early adopters (circa 2008-2012) we’re speculators but after that there’s been a solid pattern to it.
hmcqvv8,robertluke,11/27/2021,1,A wedding is expensive but being married isn’t.   I don’t recommend combining finances. You have your account and credit cards and he has his. It solves a lot of fights. I don’t need to see what my wife spends on nails and she doesn’t see when I buy a videogame. It’s not a secret but we don’t see that amount subtracted from “our” account.   I do feel more financially secure after being married and buying a house.
hmbrhpg,pineapplecats495,11/27/2021,1,Im thinking about opening a 529 college savings acct for my child but everywhere says to max out your retirement accounts first. my husband maxes out his 401k already and I have a pension so Im not too concerned. we already max out the roth iras too...I do have a separate 403b which isnt as good as a 401k in terms of protections...should I max out the 403b or open the 529? I live in California so there’s no real tax advantage to the 529 besides tax free growth which the 403b would be the same.

hm9rbp2,KReddit934,11/27/2021,3,You should be able to move it into 401K or open new IRA but I believe (someone correct me) that *you have to add back that tax money so the full 901.74 amount gets into the new home*...If you do that you will get the tax money refunded at tax time.  If you dont...well its a partial withdrawal and a mess.
hmd2brk,thishasntbeeneasy,11/27/2021,1,Index funds mostly. Even if theres a big worldwide catastrophic crash they tend to mostly recover within the year. CDs and HYSA are safest but come at a huge cost.  E.g. $100k in stocks hopefully averaging 6% would get you 179k in 10 years. A CD at 1% would only get $110k which means you lost 70k by playing it safe. (And the amount lost is much larger considering 2-6% inflation.

If I were in your position I would save for the house that checks more boxes. We settled for a cheaper home to avoid the higher mortgage and a few years have gone by and not that I regret it but we definitely would have been fine upsizing for our first home. Within reason of course and what youre describing is very reasonable. The couple hundred dollars a month more you will pay for that nicer house is money well spent imo. I mean you have to live there.

hmcny5o,BrightNooblar,11/27/2021,1,Marriage impacts taxes but not always the way you want. \*in general\* in one person makes the majority of the money its a gain for taxes. If each partner makes about the same you pay more overall as a married couple.     That said the question becomes Is it worth a 2% tax penalty to say youre married? If the answer is yes its for money do what you want. I bought a computer fan with cool lights. I could have gone with a boring fan but I was okay paying a bit more for a thing that made you happy. If getting married makes you happy do it.

In my city (Northern Nevada) the median home price is $575K.  Additionally I would never consider moving without already having gainful employment. $80K will be depleted by a home purchase so it wont be accessible for living off of.

hmbvvhx,Consensual-Sex,11/27/2021,1,Yes and no.   When it comes to any investment of course no one knows what’s going to happen in the future.   But if a company is showing growth and turning an increasing profit YOY people who invest in that knowing they have financials are still “speculating” to a point but it’s more educated speculation.   Most investors would sooner put money in a promising business than some random unknown company. So you can’t really compare them by just saying both are speculative when there’s more to it than that.   That being said I’m not an expert on crypto. I do have a hard time seeing how it’s not a bubble without any sort of tangible product. At some point enough people pull their coins out and the price crashes and it just sucks for anyone still holding. I’d like to be wrong about it but like I said I don’t know enough about crypto I don’t want to pretend I’m an expert.

In a way I havent had a raise at my current job for 6 years.  I just divert $1000 each paycheck into my private investment account.  This means my budget for weekly/monthly expenses havent changed.
hmctiyk,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,1,If you want to be sure the funds will be there when you need it you need to look at guaranteed options (e.g. FDIC-insured accounts treasury-backed bonds etc.). These will likely not be highly-appreciating assets.  If your timeline is truly 10 years out you could try to see what you can do with market investing and slowly convert to guaranteed assets as the timeline got shorter. For example invest in the market for five years and slowly sell long-term assets over the following five years.

Better to see if you can roll your credit card debt into another credit card that offers 0% interest for 12 months on rollovers. Then pay it aggressively.   Also if you’re working 48-96 hours per week and still can’t pay your bills despite rolling it over then it may be time to stop paying her bills or consider selling the house because you can’t afford it. You may be what they call house poor.
hma720e,stefand2010,11/27/2021,1,thx!

hma5xq1,badlero,11/27/2021,1,There would still be proof of the check being cashed. The bank has no proof of this. The first thing the police would ask for is the physical cashed checks and the bank would say they don’t have proof of the checks ever being cashed. The police would then say without proof of the checks ever being cashed then nothing they can do.
hmbmr4g,CQME,11/27/2021,1,You know I can even go into a personal example when it comes to maintenance.  I own a house right now brand new construction.  Havent paid a dime in maintenance of any sort...yet.  To buy this house I had to finish renovations on one I was looking to sell...those renovations cost upwards of $30k to include tearing out the carpet and installing tile dealing with 2 leaking toilets both of which cause mold damage retiling one of the shower stalls a hole in the patio roof installing concrete in the driveway (dirt was entering the garage) cutting down the dead tree in the front yard and replanting another one irrigation system for the new tree and the least of all my concerns pulling out weeds which filled up a u-haul trailer.  Thats just what I remember.  I believe the article says to expect 1% of house price per year in maintenance so in your case around $2500/yr but if you had to replace a roof youre going to need probably $15k or so to replace it.  So youd probably want $15k on hand and then replenish whatever you spent that year on an annual basis which hopefully will be $2500 or less.

hm9p2ip,brianmcg321,11/27/2021,1,Start here: https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/  Buy the book “The Simple Path to Wealth” by JL Collins.   The accounts you can get are a Roth IRA at Schwab and a regular brokerage account. You can invest up to $6000 per year in the Roth. But your regular brokerage account is unlimited. You should put it in a total market index. You’ll learn everything you need to know from the link I posted and that book. It’s really quite easy.
hm9jpym,debtlady,11/27/2021,1,Yep thats what I did in regard the debt but the $40K earnings will only be for the initial six months after I graduate -- once I get a little experience at a more entry-level position I can then reasonably expect $55K rising to $75K over 3-5 years.   The long-term benefits will likely pay off but I do feel like a goon for getting myself into this stressful situation

hmclxak,myroommateisgarbage,11/27/2021,1,As another user mentioned you could probably spend $800 comfortably. I also think you could spend considerably less than that if you can find the right situation. However in a different area you could possibly spend that much on an apartment for just yourself which is always preferred.
hma067l,Ufloridagatorsf,11/27/2021,1,You didnt give a ton of info but to me it sounds like youre looking for a bandaid to put on a bullet wound. Maybe we can help it you give a little more info about your income and spending habits.
hmbkxmw,tenaciouslyteetering,11/27/2021,1,Similarly my standing advice is to wait until youve both lived independently (including with a roommate that isnt each other) before getting married.  You change when you first move out. And if you move straight from your family home to living with a partner its easy to slip into an unhealthy someone-is-the-child dynamic.   Before living on ones own its hard to actually know if they are clean if they can pay bills on time and more. Taking care of your room and finances without bills is not the same.
hmc7tvk,phord,11/27/2021,1,When your debit card number gets stolen and someone runs up $10000 in fraudulent charges youll need to contact your bank and dispute all the fraud charges. The bank will reverse the charges through the system. They have 60 days to return your money to your account. They have no incentive to go faster and you will be out that money until they refund it. Youll need to keep track of all the fraudulent charges and reconcile them as they get refunded individually over the several weeks it takes for that to happen. If any charges dont get refunded youll need to raise that again with the bank and investigate what happened.  If your credit card number is stolen and used fraudulently you will need to notify the credit card company and then dont pay that part of the bill. The cc company will take care of the rest and notify you if any disputes are challenged. Meanwhile you get to keep your bank balance. If you have two credit cards you can begin using the other one while you wait for your primary one to be replaced.  Debit cards are a trick from the devil.
hm9jkat,TOPDAWG21,11/27/2021,1,youd be shocked how much eating out and getting a coffee here and there will add up to over a few years. Its also easy to buy shit you dont need as school is stressful and paying stuff you want but not need makes you feel better.
hmcf2ks,Ameteur_Professional,11/27/2021,1,I strongly recommend against waiting until your 30s to get married if you plan on having kids especially multiple.  Know yourself and your partner before getting married.  Know that both of your visions for the future align.  Know what goals you ideally want to accomplish by when.

hmbqaf0,mrisuckwithmoney,11/27/2021,1,No I don’t. I was actually doing really well during 2020 I had 10k in stocks and 5k in savings with 0 debt.

My biggest goal right now is to pay of the debt and then maybe by and RV to live in.

hmbha90,GunSlinger420,11/27/2021,1,Possibly. I have also worked in local government and seen crazier things before. Lol.  In this case I think it was an EPA change that then trickled down to the State level. It is still a Wetland but the change allowed for further mitigation efforts and moving of the buffer zone.   This all being said Im sure the county looked at the land they had on the books and adopted the law only after they saw it would have a significant financial gain for them to do so.
hma7i9l,matto_2008,11/27/2021,1,Also how old are you? You seem to be making a lot of the right moves and it’s amazing how much upping some of those contributions can be in the long haul. I started my 401k @ 20 Bought my house at 23 and just started maxing my accounts at 31. My retirement is at about 150k and my NW about 275k.

hmafjvz,RoastyMcGiblets,11/27/2021,1,I would just wait until he has 2 years tax returns as self-employed.   Taking SS early has huge implications and should not be done at the suggestion of a mortgage broker. Id even say fire that mortgage broker if he was trying to talk your dad into it.   He could apply at a local bank or credit union that holds loans rather than selling them. If your father has a good financial history and can show his construction business was profitable all those years they might approve him. He will pay a slightly higher rate since the loan cant be sold but it wont be awful.   If your finances are sound and your relationship with dad is good you might consider buying the house as an income property and renting to your father until he can qualify on his own.

hmaaajp,veloharris,11/27/2021,1,Your retirement fund is not over funded if anything its under funded. Do not touch your 401k. Your stocks are there for a reason use them. Capital gains has nothing on the penalties and/or lost compound interest of your 401k.
hmajh8z,Ok-Airline-5171,11/27/2021,1,Right and don’t forget to plan when you’re going to need a new roof new heating system new water heater plumbing & electrical when are the appliances going to go…look into the age of all these things when you buy & plan out how much to save per month to be ready when you’re going to need to buy this stuff. It’s never just mortgage & utilities.
hmc07k9,lucky_ducker,11/27/2021,1,Insurance is super expensive the first two years you have your license then it drops a little. It drops a LOT when you turn 25 and / or get married. I got married at age 25 and my car insurance dropped by 65%.
hm9nrou,decaturbob,11/27/2021,1, - the rate of tax growth on existing property really can not be compared to tax on NEW PROPERTY.  Assessors use actual purchase price on the new property which resets the tax assessment base. This has little to do with market value of existing properties except in a very remote way.  - we have owned our house for 27 years (1927 house) and being a longtime owner our taxes have gone up insignificant vs say the people across the street who bought their house 1 year ago ( 1929 built) who pay 2.5x the taxes we do.  Their purchase price established it
hmcpl2l,DigitalDiana,11/27/2021,1,Go in and talk with the manager it is very probable that they forgot the decimal place or they have new software  that is creating issues.  Before you go phone other dental offices in the area and ask what the going rate is for the  units of time you were in the dental chair. Take this data with you when you go to talk with them.  If necessary negotiate a lower price using the data collected. I would not go ahead and pay the exorbitant price. It will be a private business however they may have to answer to a professional body that usually sets the dental rates.
hmcm914,Eldi_Bee,11/27/2021,1,When I filed last year and got asked for receipts/invoices the IRS definitely accepted my PayPal statements (marked up).
hmai5hf,peacefulhectarez,11/27/2021,1,First the withholding rate for supplemental income is 22% not 45. No one pays 45% in Federal income tax (the top marginal rate is 37% and starts at over $500k). If OPs tax rate is less than 22% s/hell get some back in April.  Second actual relocation expenses--shipping your stuff mileage and hotels for driving etc.--used to be deductible until Trumps Tax Cuts and Job Act killed that deduction in 2017. Previously your employer could pay for those expenses tax-free. Now its income even if the employer hires and pays the movers themselves.
hmca7c3,CPLeet,11/27/2021,1,Oh I didn’t realize you had kids so young. You had them quite a bit later.  Well I guess still pay off the higher interest mortgage with your personal investment.  Then sell that home to pay off your current mortgage.   Then have Zero debt all over the place and rebuild your nest egg while investing in your kids future. Retire when your ready but at least you’ll be debt free.
hmacfoh,Neatguyonline,11/27/2021,1,500k loan on a 125k salary is a bit of a stretch but probably doable.  Why are you moving?  If it’s for work I would expect a COL raise of some kind.
hmd1div,hiricinee,11/27/2021,1,Remember saving money is lifestyle creep just more sustainable and affordable.  After basically saving something like 75% of my take home money living in a very cheap condo (that I owned and bought in 2010) I had enough money to pay a house so far down I am living a FAR more lavish lifestyle than my friends and co workers who lived it up for those years.    Anyways if you havent bought the house yet but you want to benefit in the medium to short term increase the down payment or pay it down like crazy to reduce your monthly payment your budgeting will be much easier your baseline spending will be much lower than it otherwise would be.  By the books just dumping cash into a diversified ETF is really the safe and most return oriented thing you can do with savings.  Remember at some point your returns on those savings could hypothetically be the equivalent of how much you were going to creep up your lifestyle previously and now you can lifestyle creep off of investment income.
hmauw4f,diatho,11/27/2021,1,This is universal. If you select Roth 401k the employer portion will go into a traditional 401k. The company can not prepay the taxes like you can for the Roth.

hma8jfk,bbh42,11/27/2021,1,Get disciplined.  Your an adult so act like one.  Get on a written budget figure out where your money is going and cut out wasteful spending.  Shelter food and clothing are basic needs.  Utilities and the ability to get to work is next then everything else is probably a want that you need to cut.  Nobody needs to eat out take your lunch and learn to cook for example.    For years we still had a land line.  My wife and I always used our cell phones.  I finally canceled it and immediately found $115 to throw at debt.  When I realized what I had been wasting a year on a stupid landline I got mad.  That I’ve had it moment does wonders for finding your way to being disciplined.
hmb15zj,Fish-Weekly,11/27/2021,1,*It’s Difficult to Make Predictions Especially About the Future*  It could be conservative or it could be optimistic - market returns over a specific period of time can be highly variable. It’s not like a bank account or CD with a set stated return.  It’s ok to use these projections for planning purposes but the best thing to do is save as much as you can and monitor your progress towards your goals adjusting as you go.

hmabrrc,robb0995,11/27/2021,1,I mean… sorta?  You are correct that only dollars that fall into a given tax bracket get taxed at that rate and that it absolutely doesn’t hurt you to go into a higher tax bracket.   However nobody is taxing you throughout the year. Your employer (or yourself if self-employed) withholds estimated taxes but you’re not actually taxed until you file your return when everything is known. Your withholding just deposits money in your “IRS account” and it’s settled up at tax time including earnings from all sources deductions credits and other adjustments.
hmd7ish,Shribble18,11/27/2021,1,Yeah I added him as an AU to all of my cards and he currently has a secured line card in his name only. I’ll be sure we keep paying early. I use to make small payments throughout the month but I’ve been getting lax.

hm91f3n,applepiecorgi,11/27/2021,1,I would consider special assessments. This happened to my parents after they bought a condo - I think it was a foundation issue that needed to be addressed/ wasn’t known at the time they bought.   Also increased property taxes. Our property taxes went up 70% last year which I’m honestly kind of peeved about because our school district sucks we have one street light on our entire street and no sidewalks. But it added a bit more to our mortgage.   Plus the possibility that HOA fees rise. In my home state most condos are already charging an arm and a leg for maintenance fees.
hmccl9n,Nateorade,11/27/2021,1,Depends on if you need to use her income for the new mortgage or not.

hmcml78,not_a_moogle,11/27/2021,1,in theory you get a bigger tax return filing as a couple but its more like it averages it out. so instead of one person getting a return and another person owing is that you combined get a return thats slightly better that the net change of the two separately.  Child credits though make a big difference.  That said being married is not inherently more expensive and assuming youre living together and splitting bills itll be cheaper.. also assuming youre careful with your budget.  Its a double edged sword though since youre both liabable for each others debts and that can bite you in the ass.  ... Not financial advice but at 22/21 youre still figuring out your live and you will be very different people at 25 and very different people from at at 30.  theres other implications that youre not considering.
hmconnx,beetle1736,11/27/2021,1,And I would keep in mind that I mean unless youre doing pretty damn good in the world it will probably be hard to be approved for a second mortgage of that size while you still have the mortgage on the first home dangling out there.
hmd8aoz,Unoriginal_White_Guy,11/27/2021,1,I have good news and bad news. As other have said employers will set up a 401(k) for new employees. A lot of them will have you contribute 1-4% of your pay and match a portion of it. They most likely sent you a letter in the mail about this way back when. The letter will tell you about the plan and investment options. They will have you set up to contribute a certain percent of your income automatically and you have to opt out by mail online or via phone. My thought process is you were contributing and they were matching some amount without you even knowing. The bad news is it most likely wasn’t being invested and sitting in cash. I have a friend that did this. He never set up an account with the plan sponsor(his was vanguard I think) and he just assumed the amount he was contributing was being invested automatically. Nope unless you directed the money it just sits in cash. Regardless congrats you might have found an extra couple hundred to thousand dollars you didn’t know about.
hma5grz,ASHAKANTASHARMA,11/27/2021,1,The situation seems very dangerous. We have now all types of scams going on covering a lot of areas.  They dont they simply earn with hard work?
hmag01o,jaybetterman,11/27/2021,1,Again it sounds like your decision has already been made.   Rephrase - how do I get myself into a house with a ton of debt w/o putting much down but also I want the benefit of being on the mortgage just in case I get divorced.   The point of the 20% is also to make sure you’re both sure. It’s easy to sign some papers for 3.5% but actually saving sacrificing and THEN handing over the 50k means you’re sure. Even if you don’t pay down your student debt totally taking the time to get even 10% down would be smart.   Clearly you want to do this together but have doubts about being protected. That should be a red flag enough to hold off.    For example say a homeowner with a FICO credit score higher than 760 borrowed $100000 that equated to 92% of the value of the home they purchased. If their mortgage lender took out a policy to cover 35% of the $100000 loan amount the borrowers PMI premium would be 2.56% of that amount or $2560.

So I think I’ll take your advice while still putting a healthy principal payment towards the house but calculated to maximize my SEP IRA investments. If my income from the business substantially increases which is possible (it could double over the next 3-5 years) I will look at just laying down while seeing if I can get into any additional tax advantage accounts. I heard there is a ROTH 401K self employed people can do.

hmclhg3,not_a_moogle,11/27/2021,1,if an insurance says it will 100% pay for x but not y. thats on them for just not saying it will pay for 60% of everything and defeats the purpose of insurance.  youre better off not getting insurance and working with the hospitals directly for discount billing or find non for profits that will help cover costs.
hm95q49,skinnedalmond,11/27/2021,0,Thanks! We did we went through our states web system that manages government employee pensions. It allowed us to calculate his pre-tax pension based on when he plans to retire. I’ll triple check though if this seems extraordinary
hmd5hhf,Linusthewise,11/27/2021,1,You can do this in small increments. Buy something let the balance hit your account pay it off return the item. Youll have a credit on your account.
hmcto1u,erotictravel,11/27/2021,1,You will owe taxes on any short or long term capital gains but no penalties.
hmcd8vm,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,VFIAX and SWPPX are basically the exact same thing offered by two different companies. Youre not any more or less diversified than if you had one or the other.  Its not diversified compared to a total market fund but the performance of the S&P and the entire market has been nearly identical over the past couple decades so what youve got isnt the worst thing in the world. I definitely wouldnt create a taxable event and reset the long term gains clock by selling one for the other.  You may wish to put future investments into VTSAX *or* SWTSX to be invested in the total market. VTIAX *or* SWISX would give you some international exposure.
hmandfp,Dirtylicious,11/27/2021,1,It shows financial strength of the buyer. In todays competitive market sellers are often receiving multiple offers.   The buying process is a negotiation. A 5% down offer can be interpreted that the buyer does not have enough capital to make up the difference if there is an appraisal gap. Or is there is a lengthy inspection report with multi issues they may want excess compensation.

hmaoh27,420throwawayacc,11/27/2021,1,Gotcha! I stand by my suggestion to use gig work and pay as much towards the loans as possible. In my eyes thats really the best option and will serve you better long term than taking another loan.   Good luck!!!

hm8wltp,joinedyesterday,11/27/2021,7,Everything else aside where are you getting 20% return on consistently?
hmb487q,1hotjava,11/27/2021,1,None of us can know. There’s a lot of factors that go into this and one of the biggest is depreciation recapture. They really need an account / CPA to help if they aren’t sure.

hmb5fzz,Squanchy187,11/27/2021,1,So this seems in line with Motobugs comment above correct? That is even if I set my contribution to 50% in order to get $500 per pay period ($500/$1000 = 50%) the employer will only contribute $40 per pay period. Is this what youre getting at?
hmcybkb,seriouslyjan,11/27/2021,1,Thats great advice I hadnt thought of making sure that the utilities were separated at the close of escrow or settlement.  Thanks.
hmadesm,antifaction,11/27/2021,1,Yes the last step after all the debt over 4% is paid off and you are taking advantage off all the tax advantages accounts (401k IRA etc) then you need to start putting your money somewhere- for short terms goals maybe a CD or just a savings account but longer term savings should go into the market in the form of stocks- but don’t be tempted to play the market- just buy a reputable index fund with low fees. VTSAX is an example of one- it’s run by vanguard. The lowest buy in to get the admiral shares (lowest fee) is 3K.  If you can invest 30-40% of your income and have low expenses- you could have the option to be creative with your employment. The rule of the thumb is to be able to live off of 4% of your investment per year. You have at least six months before you would be in a position to start investing so you will have plenty of time to look into what to invest in.
hm9i80h,Academic-Chance-4240,11/27/2021,2,Okay thanks! My main concern was if changing credit card info was time-consuming or had a drawn out process but I guess its better safe than sorry. Again thank you for the response.
hmb6349,ack154,11/27/2021,1,Are you using your credit cards - like buying something and paying them off each month? Doing that and demonstrating on time payments and responsible credit usage is probably going to be more helpful than another credit card. And you really only need to do that with one of them.
hma6umg,tired_of_username,11/27/2021,1,Thats what I thought.  You want the benefit of using someone elses money/credit to make an investment without a commitment.  Look I dont care how you live your life.  Just own it.  Such arrangements always end badly.  At least with a marriage the obligations when things fall apart is in a standard contract governed mostly by law.  If you arent living under a marriage contract you will one day be paying large sums of money to a lawyer to sort out the mess.
hmbchhy,LLR1960,11/27/2021,1,And no sense buying/selling twice with the costs that go along with that if you dont have to.  Find a house thats big enough to stay in without being a monster house and youre set.  That assumes the bigger house is decently affordable.

hmaogwc,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,If the friend is a sole proprietor filing schedule C the only way to lessen the SE tax of 15.3% is increase business costs.  Probably time to talk to a tax professional before years end. As to lowering actual income tax theres multiple vehicles to mitigate that. But again you need a tax professional now to get it done correctly before years end.  If its an LLC or something similar perhaps the business itself might be able to do so. But my answer still stands -- get a tax professional quickly to do whatever before years end.
hmaks80,wild_b_cat,11/27/2021,1,Using a passive rental activity to generate losses is possible but very limited. If your income is above a certain threshold you can’t do it at all and if you’re under that threshold then you don’t really need to do it in the first place.   So no it’s not a good way to reduce taxes in general.

hmd6lo3,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,1,For short-term savings I would rather invest in FDIC-insured account because Im guaranteed not to lose the money I invested. If you were to invest in an ETF/MF in a brokerage account that fund could decrease in value (theres no guarantee it will increase or by what amount) and you could be out money when it came time to sell the funds (to access the money).

The average person is very bad at saving and seeing thousands in an account is very likely to make them not worry about spending more on other stuff they may not need.
hm9l8ze,chaoticneutral262,11/27/2021,1,Investing in yourself especially when you are young is one of the most important things you can do.  That said most books are only read one time so it is a waste to own one if you will not use it again in the future (such as a reference guide).  In most cases the best thing to do is borrow a book from a library if they have or can get what you want.  A quick search of my local library shows that they have dozens of books on Korean as well as CDs where you can hear it spoken to you.

hmbt06p,Downtown_Cucumber_,11/27/2021,1,Your sister may have an idea that works for her. You and your partner need to decide what works for you guys. Communication about finances is key in any marriage and you should both align on your financial fundamentals (ideally before you tie the knot but if your fundamentals are aligned you’ll be ok because finances are an ongoing process).   Something to think about: my husband and I decided to combine all our finances but we do maintain individual accounts (details shared with each other) just in case something were to go wrong with all our combined assets (you never know).
hmbwxx9,BastidChimp,11/27/2021,1,I dont think you have anything to worry about. You look to be in good shape with just your mortgages. But if you dont plan on living in your family home you could sell it and be done with it since it has the higher interest rate. But personally I think you have handled everything responsibly.
hm9iikh,PersonalBrowser,11/27/2021,1,The Citi Custom Cash card is good since it gives you 5% on a specific category so you can use it to supplement your suite of other cards. For example if you eat at restaurants then having 5% back in restaurant purchases is pretty good if you were otherwise only getting 2-3% back for that category of spending.   That being said anybody that churns credit cards for points and benefits can tell you you aren’t supposed to carry a credit balance. And the fact that you’re primarily focused on getting 0% balance transfers and moving debt around and putting off repayment highlights that you are the perfect type of prey that these credit card companies are hunting for.   From this brief post it doesn’t look like you’re the type of person to responsibly use credit cards to be honest. I’d pay off all your balances and then use one credit card for all your purchases and pay the full balance off monthly.

hmcp8h2,radwagonier,11/27/2021,1,There is no problem investing with both a Roth and Traditional IRA. You are subject to the IRA contribution limits across all accounts combined I believe.   You may be able to call up the Fidelity rep and have that Roth IRA recharacterized as traditional without any penalty.   No big deal you learn as you go.

hmc7vyj,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,So the dealer is trying to help you. The bank doesnt want to approve a 9800 loan against a 10k vehicle. So you give them a $2K down payment.... an 8k loan on a 10k is more appealing to the bank.   But I dont understand what the dealer has to gain out of this. Why are they so eager to move this vehicle?
hm9921i,feistypenguin,11/27/2021,1,https://budgeting.thenest.com/normally-happens-lose-paycheck-23209.html  Its not unusual for paystubs to show the same pay if you worked the same number of hours each pay period. So I wouldnt read into that too much.  For whatever bank account you are depositing the checks into can you pull up your transaction history and filter out the deposits you have made? I havent had a paper paystub in a while but I believe many of them include a tally of your yearly earnings up to that point.  You should be able to do the math and see if you have an extra pay periods worth of money in there. Most major banks allow you to download your transaction history or filter it by credit (spend) or debit (receive). Also as others mentioned you can talk to the payroll department of your employer if they are big enough to have one.  Usually (not always) if a paycheck is lost then the employer will file a Stop Payment order with the bank BEFORE issuing the new check. Then if you were to actually try and deposit the check the transaction would be denied.
hm93lrb,islangmemes,11/27/2021,3,You do realize it doesn’t matter right? Once your earnings bring you over the next tax threshold the money you bring in after that point is taxed at a higher rate it’s not for overall earnings for the year.   A very common misconception is it’s your entire income for the year is taxed at the highest level you’d earn. There’s no way the IRS can predict that. People lose jobs change jobs get promotions etc. that’s why you’re taxed based on how much you’ve earned for the year at any given point in time.  Tldr  keep working those extra shifts. Won’t hurt you.
hmbe6hp,joelmole79,11/27/2021,1,I did not have my financial house in order until I got married but I also married someone who was responsible.  This said don’t expect marriage to change someone in that regard. If they have bad financial habits and/or are not a high earner consider the likelihood that this will continue into marriage. That is the part that is really expensive along with divorce. Raising a family buying a house and lifestyle creep is also very expensive. But these are things you potentially do to build the life you want.  Once you are married and especially if you have kids you now have obligations to people other than yourself. These obligations are costly but can spur you to take more responsibility for your future if you have a good head on your shoulders. I don’t think I would have been motivated to advance my career without this kick in the butt.  But above all you need to make sure you talk honestly about priorities with your partner and the sort of life you are striving to build and make sure you are on the same sheet of music.  It’s easy to get into a situation where you’ve committed your time talents and treasure to borrow a turn of phrase to something that you doesn’t bring you happiness. Time is the most precious commodity so guard that and use it wisely above all else.

hmak77d,EhhWhateverr,11/27/2021,1,Close it before the fee hits. Might bump your score down 10-15 points but I promise you’ll recover within a few months.   Option 2 is to try to get the fee waived. Call the credit card company and say you’re considering closing the card but ask if they have any “retention benefits” available. I do this for all of my cards that have fees and they waive it 75% of the time. The other 25% of the time I close the card.

How did the insurance company inspect your damages? It’s going to be so much more complex for the body shop to work on the car. They have to tear down your damages.  Inspect to see what is damage that you can see and put in a supplement and wait for insurance company to come down and look. Also if you have the estimate of the damages parts and what they are replacing/repairing with the check bring it to the shop also

hmbksl7,Adorable_Tour_2892,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the reply!  1. Thats my thought. Although technically a true 6 month emergency fund with our current $14000 monthly spending would be $84k which seems way excessive. If we really were in an emergency lost a job situation wed cut our spending and I could defer my loans which places the real 6 month fund near $30-35k. Thats where I came up with that number to keep in the savings account. 2. I currently have no IRA set up. Just what goes into our 401k and then a fidelity brokerage account. Ive looked into the roth backdoor you think thatd be superior to putting into a brokerage? 3. Thanks for the feedback! Tough battling with my self looking at the potential versus getting out of debt.
hmadmmw,billy_the_kid16,11/27/2021,1,$800 monthly on groceries for my husband and I  $128 monthly on alcohol  $320 monthly on formula   We don’t purchase coffee out kind of a rule of ours  Edit: we eat out with my parents usually once or twice monthly and they pay sometimes as a treat they will order us take out and pay for it.  Double edit: a lot of this depends on where you live and what month it is. Obviously around Christmas time when I’m cooking more for gatherings it goes up or even could go down if it’s dead of summer and all we eat is salads. It’s just my husband myself and our 5mo were 31 & 32

hmc6kyj,RockAtlasCanus,11/27/2021,1,Not enough information to know for sure. Accounts can be closed down due to fraud if the account number not the card number is compromised. Typically the bank would open a new account with a new number and move all your other services over to that new account.  Now this is a complete guess based on the information in your post but this sounds likely that your dad either repeatedly overdrew the account or overdrew it and let it stay that way for quite some time.  Eventually Wells Fargo opted to close his account. It is possible your dad was the victim of fraud or a scam of some kind that overdrew the account and caused the account to be shut down. If that’s the case he needs to report it to the bank- ASAP. If someone steals money out of your account and you report it it is most likely that you will be made whole whether the bank eats that loss or recovers the stolen funds. I can’t remember exactly but consumer accounts have a long window- I want to say 90+ days to report fraud.  It is also possible that your dad simply spent all his money and is casting blame for his excessive spending on “being hacked”. There is simply not enough information here and however likely without knowing more I am not going to make that assertion. It sounds like a really shitty situation you are in either way I hope things turn around for you and your family soon.
hmcybbw,bb0110,11/27/2021,1,You need to emphasize that it makes sense in VERY few circumstances and situations.
hmawqnv,TheQuaeritur,11/27/2021,1,Congratulations on your great job! Your plan and more importantly your desire to plan ahead are good.  A few things that come to mind :  Do you get health insurance through work? If not add it to your budget.   Do you have student loans or other debts?  If so prioritize paying these off.   And to avoid having a lot of disposable income without a goal every month which could lead to overspending  Id spread the $2000 between various sinking funds. The way it works you funnel cash (literally or on a spreadsheet) into various funds and you draw on the appropriate fund as needed. Sinking funds may include: shoes & clothes holiday break Christmas gifts electronics or large appliances giving property taxes... This builds expectation before spending  makes it more satisfying  forces you to plan ahead...

hmaaii3,Mikemtb09,11/27/2021,1,10 years is insane. In US you can “sell” it for $1 and pay transfer taxes/fees etc depending on the state. It would be called a non-arms length transaction but there are legal legit ways to do it that are far cheaper than purchasing it at market value and not being in trouble for fraud.
hmc1mq8,Squid1622,11/27/2021,1,Do not sell your car. With low mileage like that you should be able to keep your car running for a few more years. Right now prices are hella inflated and inventory is low. Dealerships that were turning $3k gpu are now in the mid $5-6k range on gpu. If you sell it now you’re just keeping yourself stuck in a debt cycle. There is a huge push among larger dealers and used car companies to shorten the amount of time a person owns a car too. The market standard for car sales is once every five years. Many are trying to push that to 3 years. They don’t make a ton of money on the vehicles themselves. The majority of that gpu is made up in ancillary fees after market items and other add ons. Additionally you’d likely be trading lower insurance premiums for higher ones.

hm9c3ai,CollateralSandwich,11/27/2021,1,OP Im even going to ask that you consider staying in longer and making it a career. If you truly are rudderless you can do far far worse than a career in the military. Just make sure youre not in a position to be a bullet-stopper. 20 years in and you can start collecting a pension at 40% of your rate. 30 years is 60%. Taking yourself to the private sector at 40 with training connections and a resume will likely catch the eye in good ways while collecting a bit on the side is nothing to sneeze at.  I went National Guard and didnt re-up. In middle age and with hindsight I wish Id gone full time and stayed in. With the right MOS you could do well for yourself. Dont let your recruiter talk you into anything. They just want the spiff for getting you into a shit MOS they need filled.

hmbxgij,MovieJunior,11/27/2021,1,Even if you are a fan of crypto logical sense wouls be to not bet on interest beating returns and pay off the cc debt.
hmbtdgu,ThereOnceWasAMan,11/27/2021,1,>intelligence clearance is worth money to civilian contractors because they dont have to pay for it if you already have it  FYI this is a common misconception.  Civilian contractors do not pay for getting their employees clearances. That doesnt mean a cleared new hire isnt worth a lot to the employer of course - cleared hires are very valuable but only because a) it drastically reduces risk (of the clearance not being granted) and b) it saves on several months / years of finding work for the new employee while they wait.
hmcc0az,68_Bullitt,11/27/2021,1,> But I dont understand what the dealer has to gain out of this. Why are they so eager to move this vehicle?  Theyre likely selling it to OP at an extremely high price and/or interest rate. I can assure you its not because its in the OPs interest.

hm9iymp,Distributor127,11/27/2021,1,I know a young woman hat bought a salvage title car.   It can be a risk.  Ive seen them blow fuses forever.  But this woman put the savings toward buying a house with her boyfriend.   Worked out great
hmb9h9y,lig710,11/27/2021,1,This would depend on your family dynamic but it could be worth talking with your mom about the situation (even though it could be a fairly uncomfortable conversation).  Maybe the plane tickets are refundable or maybe someone else could use them?  IMO if you have a destination wedding you have to go into that knowing not everyone can spend thousands of dollars to come.  I make $35k/year and also could not handle an unexpected $2k expense without making a big dent in my savings something Im not very comfortable doing for a non-emergency.  It sounds like she is already aware money is tight for you and would hopefully understand.
hm8vh4e,HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,11/27/2021,1,Unless you’re investing that money somewhere and making money there’s no point in taking out a loan.
hmdbqtq,Varathien,11/27/2021,1,>We could match a Roth IRA but we couldnt match a 401(k).  Huh? Theres no such thing as a Roth IRA match...
hmbs9bc,93195,11/27/2021,1,It’s not unusual to have a resume out there even if you’re not “really” looking.  Don’t worry about it.  Just keep doing what you’re doing.  And no I wouldn’t jump at the non profit either as pay and responsibility increases will likely be similarly limited there too.  That’s a lateral at best.
hmdbkee,Demigodd,11/27/2021,1,I am no expert by any means means but I would go for 1.2 mil->1.5 mil . I fight to to keep 1 million in the bank after attorney and taxes(is that even a thing for this ?) are deducted from settlement amount . I have NO experience at all though . This is my opinion .

hmcc729,68_Bullitt,11/27/2021,1,This. For example if you assume a 5% growth rate that would be ~8% with historic inflation built-in. Much easier OP.
hmcg816,blaze1234,11/27/2021,1,Stay. Keep looking aggressively for that big bump in pay.  Unless you **really** are convinced of that great learning opportunity being worth all the life disruption with no pay increase
hmctlit,4and2,11/27/2021,1,An amicable divorce does not have to be 5 figures. You have to pay the fee to file but can pay a paralegal to do the documents if you agree on how to split things both sign it and submit to the court to be signed off. When you get lawyers involved and it is contentious then it will be very expensive.
hmb2y34,Motobugs,11/27/2021,1,Sorry man. If its truly not i the network youre responsible. Technically in this case youre responsible to check whether its in the network or not not the PA.
hm9x954,sluox777,11/27/2021,1,This is generally not done at a bank in the US so you must be thinking of something else. Unless you mean a private bank for ultra high net worth individuals. You need a trust and estate lawyer.
hm9sw7k,520throwaway,11/27/2021,1,Ditto in the UK and Spain. The American system looks like the 90s comparatively.

hmbbiht,simplyproductive,11/27/2021,1,A less expensive skincare routine that you can try is to use witch hazel and then moisturize. Do NOT skip moisturizing. This works best for combo or oily skin which is likely with acne. Dont forget to do it twice a day after washing your face.
hm9r8cy,sir_richard_head,11/27/2021,1,Ahh.  Thanks for pointing out my misunderstanding.

hma33y6,Stable-McCafe,11/27/2021,1,Heres an unpopular opinion. Stay at the same job add $100k to your current salary. Leave next year. When applying next year youll have about $100k more to ask from another employer.   PS. Mental health is more important than money. But Im sure you know that and contemplating this because of the large increase which can be a huge pro that cascades through the rest of your career.
hmae9as,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,Go online and lock down your credit profiles even if you dont have much of ones. Your SSN is forever. One day your identity will be valuable to someone and you must assume its out there now.  Start by calling the little number on the back of your debit card or going into a branch and tell them there are unauthorized charges and your card information was stolen. Shut down this account and open a new one. File fraud charges with your bank. File a police report. Both of these will protect you down the line if theres ever a question about your identity and credit.   Never keep your SSN in your wallet. Treat it like its the most humiliating photo ever taken of you and keep safely hidden away    Lets talk about you using the term friend. Youre old enough to understand that friends ask for help they do not steal from you. If you are uncertain you have to decide if this person you suspect is worthy of the benefit of the doubt while altering your behavior around them possibly forever in order to protect yourself.  If you are pretty certain give the name and why you believe them to be the thief to the bank and law enforcement. (I assume from your description youve seen these photos or were informed by someone who has. That doesnt really leave much room for doubt.)  This is a tough lesson. Learn to be more vigilant with your valuables identity and financial information -- even with friends.   Good people do bad things everyday in this world. None of us are our worst mistake  thank goodness. But being a good person isnt a guarantee of them being a safe person. Remember that going forward with future friends. Goodness is often unrelated to bad behaviors.   This friend if the thief is dangerous to your valuables. If you must interact with them remember that. Honor their humanity in those interactions but never turn your back for a second.   I am so sorry this happening to you like this. But be gentle with yourself. Youre entitled to be young and inexperienced believing the best of people. You didnt create the thief. You simply allowed yourself to be too vulnerable to theft -- a thing easily rectified.  Betrayal of trust is one of the more disconcerting life lessons but you will get through it and better for it.   Best wishes  Signed someone whos kids are more than a decade older than you.
hmaskpu,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,An IRA is an excellent place to start. Paperwork is minimal simple to setup and manage. She can do up to $6K for 2021 and has until April 15 of 2022 to contribute for this year. She can then contribute up to $6K (maybe as $500/month) starting 1 January 2022 for the 2022 tax year.   Schwab Fidelity or Vanguard (mine) are often mentioned as being easy to work with low fees and solid investment options. Almost anything she could do with a brokerage account she can do with any of these three. I stumbled into Vanguard and have no reason to switch but each has small pros/cons that even out.   Oh and its not a 25 year retirement fund its a (up to) 50 year rest of life fund. Very long term and doesnt change substantially just because one day she starts calling herself retired. Food clothing shelter and enjoying life shift a bit but its a shift not an earthquake.
hmaks9c,_releaf_,11/27/2021,1,Dollar cost averaging is a byproduct of continually investing it should not be the foundation of your investments. Decide on which type of investing youd like your risk tolerance and just continue to invest into that strategy. No sense in making things too complicated!
hmblma0,DerProfessor,11/27/2021,1,Groundswell Conservancy (formerly Natural Heritage Land Trust) is a great Wisconsin conservancy.... good people working for them.  (They do conservation easements etc.)    Id contact them describe your situation and see if you can get a sweet tax break for the donation.
hmba7x4,readytonavigate,11/27/2021,1,One week of wages will keep you from being too house poor. It is a good safe place to be.
hmby0sb,NH3-Chief,11/27/2021,1,Not financial but you should wait to marry until you are fully formed adult. Its not likely either of you know what you truly want or who you really are at this point. Itll save you money in the long run.
hm95309,SnooCauliflowers3903,11/27/2021,1,Can you buy vti in fidelity
hm9ouve,sleevelesspineapple,11/27/2021,1,I work in payroll.  It’s just good sense if someone is missing an ENTIRE paycheque to issue a wire transfer as soon as the funds have been returned to the company bank.  I assume the employee is living pay cheque to pay cheque in those situations.  However if it was only one or two missed shifts due to the employee failing to clock in (as an example) we would advise the funds would come through on the next pay cycle unless they come back and say they are in financial distress or it gets escalated otherwise which is rare.
hmalu41,antheus1,11/27/2021,1,I didn’t know 457s are subject to FICAs thanks for that info. I know that I COULD do that was just curious if there was a calc that did it for me.  As an aside do your pay state and local tax on 401k/457b contributions?
hm8vkzy,ThighOfTheTiger,11/27/2021,1,Depending on how long youre talking short term savings should be kept in a savings account. You could put into a brokerage account but there is more risk for short term investments.  There are ways to use retirement account money before retirement age such as SEPP.
hmcttih,toastybage1,11/27/2021,1,Underrated comment. I work for a credit union in the mortgage department. We do tons of mortgages for self employed folks who are making far less than OP.
hmaok6t,BobMcQ,11/27/2021,1,Yes Ive seen financing get rejected after the car is off the lot (Ive been in the business for almost 20 years.)  Its uncommon 99% of the deals are actually approved before they leave and the 1% that arent are normally a clear cut case of isnt approved yet but will be no problem.   Every now and again (like 1 in 5000 deals) the dealership guesses wrong and isnt able to get it approved at all after letting the car out. In my state at least (Maine) the customer should have been notified that the deal wasnt approved yet but Im familiar with every state so it is possible that you wouldnt know.
hm9haz6,trollreign,11/27/2021,1,He is giving you excellent advice! Your first step should be creating an emergency fund of a couple grand then getting rid of the student loan debt. Then you can start saving for a house and retirement. Your student loan debt and lack of savings is holding you back a lot more than your money saved for retirement puts you ahead.
hmbpw8z,danielv123,11/27/2021,1,Yeah that is 0.25% a year.
hmctm4y,chrisinator9393,11/27/2021,1,You can get married for as little as $40. Just go to your town hall and sign a paper. Boom married. Congrats enjoy the rest of your lives together!
hmapppn,Raeandray,11/27/2021,1,I’m honestly not sure what they’re saying there. If it’s inherited they shouldn’t have to purchase it.
hmb296j,iWillNeverReplyToYou,11/27/2021,1,This. Put the new money directly into saving for retirement and dont even think about it
hmb59a6,out_o_focus,11/27/2021,1,For acne have you been to the doctor? Spironolactone can be prescribed and works wonders. For others they have results with Accutane (though this has a lot of other side effects). If youre getting scarring its absolutely serious and worth getting treated.   Frugality is one thing but long term skin damage is not frugal.
hmcexiv,yellowcanvas,11/27/2021,1,I had a nice home gym setup where I had a treadmill a combination machine for upper body and a barbell and bumper plates going up to 240lbs. I’m guessing not PF? I haven’t been to a PF so i dont know exactly what they have available.
hm93m3h,SnooCauliflowers3903,11/27/2021,2,Amazing detective work.
hm8wnri,charleswj,11/27/2021,4,I dont see why people are so insistent on switching banks. This stuff happens more than just this once most are just not so dumb to out themselves. This is like freaking out about an SSN breach...sorry to break it to you its *been* leaked.
hmahado,donniePump39,11/27/2021,1,Ill give this a read. Have seen it come up in r/Fire and a few other threads recently as well.  Thanks again and hope you have a nice weekend!
hma93g2,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,My advice is both simple and hard.   What purpose does your over spending especially using cc serve? Answer that and youll be half way to being to able to make better decisions AND follow through on them.   You say not disciplined enough but in my experience in the world doing something even when you dont want to do it is usually indicative of an underlying issue.   If only knowing the right answer were enough in life wed all be the perfect size for us super fit and have a bitchin savings account right?   Interrogate what it is youre actually buying. Is it a new feeling? A look good in front of others? Affection? A distraction?   Are you in fact simply living a lifestyle that is currently beyond your means?   In answer to your question I judge it to be unwise to do anything else financially until you get your arms around the underlying drivers for your repeatedly choosing unwise cc spending.
hmd2307,evantom34,11/27/2021,1,How much do you currently have in retirement accounts? What’s your future financial goals?  Depending on your future goals I’d keep renting and stash some more into your retirement accounts. Especially because you mentioned you are starting later than most.  I’d aim for maxing 401K (19500) and Roth (6K) for a few years before buying your house.
hmb47fn,toxicity187,11/27/2021,1,Why not just sit on it and forget about it?  Maybe someone in your familys next generation might be in a better position to profit on it.    Nothing to lose by 25 bucks a year right?
hmd603t,DaydrinkingWhiteClaw,11/27/2021,1,Just on the acne: try buying a new hypoallergenic pillow (not feathers) and only sleep on each side once before changing/washing the pillowcase. And try an OTC benzoyl peroxide face wash. Use a light moisturizer after washing with this. And never touch your face with unwashed hands. If that doesnt work see a dermatologist.
hmcj1tc,Nodeal_reddit,11/27/2021,1,If the answer is “likely” then I’d look for another option. You generally get paid the full interest even if you only owe $1 when the introductory term ends.
hm9zdse,antoniosrevenge,11/27/2021,1,Self-promotion advertising soliciting etc. are not allowed here ([rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/about/rules)).  * Promotion of web content products services companies or anything else owned by you (or anyone affiliated with you) even if not monetized * Accounts with promotional profiles or usernames * Offering referral invite or affiliate links/codes * Soliciting business/investors market research media requests or recruiting * Repeatedly or prominently stating financial credentials * PM/DM requests or offers
hmcarc4,SemanticTriangle,11/27/2021,1,The way to answer this question is to never have to answer it after the fact.  I would suggest reading What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars by Brendan Moynihan and Jim Paul. The TLDR is that before you buy a position you should write down explicitly all the conditions under which you would sell that position. If those conditions are later met you sell the position no matter what new justification you are able to come up with at the time. This is essentially a stop loss condition that helps you deal with sunk cost fallacy.  If you havent done this then see /u/yes_its_hims [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/r3qy3o/when_is_a_good_time_to_sell_a_losing_stock/hmc7xfw/). The best time to sell a loser was yesterday the second best time is now.
hmctxqo,BruceCourteous4444,11/27/2021,1,What do you mean “to beat”? Do you mean bear against?
hmd56da,Gutkrusha,11/27/2021,1,Pretty much everything ive seen has said not to be a total hardass. Does this approach actually work?
hmayp48,mrisuckwithmoney,11/27/2021,1,At least ur bills are legitimate. I racked up all my bills from horrible decisions. Much easier to spend 12500 then pay it back. Doordash is a good job for me I just ended up in my spot because the last year I would spend and out everything on a credit card and just not work telling myself “ I will just doordash really hard for a month and pay it off” then the debt just keeps rising and I’m drowning :( I’m so ashamed of myself
hma9ucl,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,I know ideally wed have more money saved up for a down payment but we also were expecting to have another year to save for it. Weve done the math and can handle the monthly mortgage payment but its mostly the guilt of not having the money presaved like we had planned before buying a house. His mom kind of surprised us with asking us to start house shopping sooner than later. And we had originally considered renting between selling and buying but when we looked into it an apartment where we can bring our 3 animals and have enough space for us and the baby is going to cost us more monthly than a mortgage payment. So weve cut our budget as low as we can go for the last couple months and for the next few to save as much money as we can for a down payment. Were not in a horrible shape financially we just dont have a ton of savings besides our down payment right now.
hma1oh3,Woody1918,11/27/2021,1,It’s is a fairly large global healthcare company - about 18000 employees.  The company does not  make contributions with the exception of the 3% match.  They instead offer an option to contribute to a non-qualified plan which I can take when I separate from the company.  I added more to that to make up the difference.  I wonder if that was the smart move.
hmcxmy2,Madly_Maxie,11/27/2021,1,It should be for some.
hm9q7js,achieve_my_goals,11/27/2021,1,This is difficult without any more information. How much are you paying? How many rooms is the place? Where are you located? What access do you have to transport and how much do you need it? Is distance work a possibility for you?
hm9ow71,FinsterFolly,11/27/2021,2,Invest it is pretty direct. If you are looking for more detail try one of the prioritizing investments guides. The wiki hear has a good one. I like the Bogleheads linked below. If you want a YouTube version check out the Money Guys Financial Order of Operations.  https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing\_investments
hmbbjnl,BruceCourteous4444,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for the recommendation. Is it actually good to own a share of S&P 500? Do you have any other recommendations? Do you have a mutual fund portfolio that I can replicate?
hm8u5t2,Tinlizzie2,11/27/2021,8,Very VERY unethical. Screenshot that Facebook message freeze your credit and get on the phone to the fraud department of your bank ASAP. They will be able to advise you what your next steps should be. I saw where you said your money had been moved- thats good. There is no telling what else this guy has done to get money from people or to what lengths hes willing to actually go.
hmbsfbh,sevoiso,11/27/2021,1,If we are buying new construction I’ve heard that the realtor does nothing anyway so I am essentially gifting her a large sum of money which honestly I am OK with if the realtor doesn’t do anything anyway in the situation. If we have to talk to agents and negotiate (buying from a listing agent) I would not use her. I dunno man
hmd5nat,LetsBeCoolMan,11/27/2021,1,> lol maybe you should rethink what you wrote   This was his first comment to me and I should stop being catty? While 90% of the comments have been helpful and constructive this guy came here obviously with bad argumentative intentions   I asked a specific question and without any background information what’s so ever this person is commenting as if I’m aloof and clueless about the basic of home finance.   The internet is a toxic place and I appreciate the helpful folk but ya the rest of y’all are shit
hmae689,rickybobinski,11/27/2021,1,I would recommend seeing a doctor and waiting before stating there are no injuries. Been in 2 rear end accidents and days later I had soreness and pain that wasn’t there the day of the accident.
hmbbdjs,Jabrichmond,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the tips everyone. I forgot to mention that I recently got a job that pays 10K more a year than my last job. I already have a healthy amount contribution to my Roth 401K and HSA but will probably up the contribution now that I have more wiggle room.   As of now my rent and bills are already paid for the month of December and am sitting with $1200 in my checking account. I wish I felt good about being in this situation right now but for some reason I don’t. I don’t really have the urge to spend large amounts of money on things I don’t need like electronics or clothes nor do credit cards sound appealing to me.  I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that I was CONSTANTLY worried about my bank account balance when I was pretty deep in debt and I think in the back of my mind I’m worried that I will go down the slippery slope again even if I do budget or track my spending. I guess I find it hard to trust my habits as of right now.
hmce6kl,newaccount721,11/27/2021,1,Yeah why are people reading this so negatively. OPs boss probably doesnt have much flexibility in terms of increasing direct compensation so is looking at alternatives to keep op
hmd1w0j,lightnglass,11/27/2021,1,What kind of car do you have (and year)?  How many miles are on the car roughly?  Is the car in nice shape?  Depending on the answers to these questions you may be better off ditching the car at a dealership and getting a cheaper used car a low monthly payment lease etc.    Your interest rate sounds like it is high but check what the interest rate is on the car - that is what matters more than anything.  If your interest is relatively low as others have said you will be better off investing the money in a index fund (can walk you through this if you need it).
hmblxop,chriswearingred,11/27/2021,1,You can still get right of way rights even if your property is locked by someone elses
hmanxpi,pasnow,11/27/2021,1,Probably due to legal fees associated with putting it into someones name (who is living)
hmcqhjs,houseismyhomeboy,11/27/2021,1,Yes it’s called You invest and can be done through the chase app
hmcnjmz,alanmitch34,11/27/2021,1,Paid service?  TipRanks is my go to favorite.  Its in the hundreds per year but I firmly believe it pays for itself.  Aside from all the screening services and stock analysis news and smart score....the best part is it automatically scours the web and provides fact based information like who the top rated analysts are based on actual track records.  Then you can see what this population of select individuals agrees on.  Free services?  TipRanks basic but it is overly limiting. For better results: 1. Marketwatch  2. Seeking Alpha 3. Barchart.com  Note - most all of these have premium plans too but I havent found as useful as TipRanks.   Pro tip:  If you use up your monthly # of free articles on these sites you can usually open a new incognito window and paste in the article URL to get past the blockers.
hmcwiy6,BFLO-Retail,11/27/2021,1,Im in the car business.  Iv seen 888 high scores but never below 350.  I guess if you’re below a 350 they take you away in hand cuffs.
hmd66wn,LetsBeCoolMan,11/27/2021,1,Nope! All current payments my wife makes with her current job an account she owns separately just to handle the mortgage and currently renters pay all the payments plus more which will continue for the near future hopefully. She even files a separate tax return
hmd5cc8,Cowboywizzard,11/27/2021,1,Probably a more correct thing to say is that it sucks to have to make a potentially life changing choice based on whether you can afford the diagnostic testing which is what /u/InterimFatGuy is probably getting at.
hmd3dga,bassjam1,11/27/2021,1,Yeah theres a tax benefit.  And theres other practical financial benefits like sharing the mortgage/rent/ groceries/utilities/furniture (if you both work).  And you might get a car insurance discount.  Theres also a mindset benefit.  No longer are you just working and saving for yourself but also someone else now.  That was huge for me personally.  No longer did I blow any money that wasnt set aside for bills or retirement I started saving more and more.  Which meant my emergency savings went from 1 month to 3 months to 6 months etc.  I was able to squirrel away more and more in my 401k and Roth that I never could find when I was single.
hmc1rwe,alto-sun,11/27/2021,1,Sure I dont really care what you call it - the problem still stands.
hmch3ay,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,Is the match really a match or do you get that no matter what you put in?   It sounds like they have a safe harbor 401k they (have to) contribute to. Then they offer a 403b as well with no company contribution. Not exactly sure why itd be structured this way but could have happened as a result of a merger or something.
hmc2mc4,batwing71,11/27/2021,1,Put some in a regular savings and the rest in a money market checking. Then evaluate your life goals retirement etc.
hm9j57c,LowercaseShipwreck,11/27/2021,1,This. I’d only add get an individual (or 2 person) aflac plan when you’re doing risky work. I’d do a high level accident policy and a solid cancer policy maybe critical illness.   That should cover most health issues and accidents-and it’s above and beyond what health insurance pays. Cash money in your pocket just get the bill and dr record to submit with claim. 2-day pay with direct deposit on claims  Aflac saved me at a very young age and in a very unexpected medical situation
hmc3jvp,pantiesinabunch,11/27/2021,1,Unless you are dead set on going non-profit I would avoid it.  Notoriously lower pay and career stagnation.  During tumultuous times non-profits get hit hard.  Just my HR 2 cents.
hmcnj2g,accountingbro24,11/27/2021,1,Read reviews and the website of the ones you’re looking at locally and make sure they can give you the services you’re looking for.
hm9174o,MarquitoMarquez,11/27/2021,1,I make 60K a year and I currently have 10K saved in my savings account for a future house. Would a 400K house possible be for me? I plan on continue saving to make 20% down payment.   In 20 years my salary would reach 75K if it helps.    Thanks
hmcjrb3,NSGoBlue,11/27/2021,1,If you are a multi millionaire something like a variable life product or other investment related life insurance can make sense depending on some circumstances. Short of that just buy term coverage for the amount you need and do all your investing in your normal 401k IRA brokerage accounts.
hmbtbvt,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,> typically the highest score from the three agencies is used.  Personal loans and credit cards may often only pull 1 lenders preference. Not highest.  Mortgages use the middle of the 3 mortgage scores.

hmadycz,OathOfFeanor,11/27/2021,1,Yep the ideal way this is handled without that tax is a rollover directly from one 401k to another.  That way they can verify that it is going into the proper type of retirement account for tax purposes so they are allowed to bypass withholding the taxes.
hm8x07k,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,1,Short term is 10 years time $1M. 2 kids in. A house in the county almost paid off from cashing out on our Austin properties in SC and FU money all wrapped into one! So we would need investments to get there as placing money into regular savings wouldn’t grow at the rate we need. Like I’m saying I want to pause working for a while and travel with my husband and kids for the entire summer (since he’s a teacher and loves this job) in Asia and not freak out. I’d still work but on my own terms.   I’m still trying to understand navigating those short term goals (10 years) vs long term (30-40 years) and correctly and responsibly allocating money and the same attention towards both those goals since I’m only 29. I think I’d have a better understanding of goal setting for FI and later retirement if I was only 10 or 15 years from your standard retirement age instead of 31.
hmcq6r5,SexyMuon,11/27/2021,1,I wouldnt worry too much about the documents. Trust me these monkeys wouldnt know what to do with such data. However the money is just lost. Seriously this is just disgusting... Best for you.
hm9qiuu,nowordsleft,11/27/2021,5,Your time horizon with a 401k is probably 40 years. Stop looking at it. Daily movements are going to happen. It will go up and down.  Thats the market. Over the long term it will go up.  If you cant handle a $20 drop what is going to happen when you have $200000 invested in it in 10 years and it goes down $10000 in one day?  Stop worrying over it.  You should be looking at it a couple of times per year to make sure your asset allocation is still where you want it to be and to increase your contributions. Thats it. Youll give yourself an ulcer or do something stupid like sell low if you look at it too often.
hmch3t4,snowdorf,11/27/2021,1,I remember recently reading a shower thought quote that was along the lines of money is only useful when you spend it   I dont buy clothing very often myself but I just spent about $400 on black friday online. I dont buy through out the year so I didnt think twice about it in the sense that I think of it like i saved up $400 by not spending and it all got spent in one shot.   If anything if you gotta spend get the best deal you can when you do spend. Then youre maxing out your savings and maxing out your value.   Best of luck friend!
hmbpzh3,samrozzi,11/27/2021,1,I’ve seen the loans through my 401k Roth IRA but you can also do a pension loan? Wasn’t aware of that will have to call HR and see.

hm9yovm,boolda,11/27/2021,1,There is no advantage of Roth 401k over Roth IRA. In fact in many ways company Roth 401k is different and worse than RIRA. I will do company match with pretax money fully fund a Roth then go back to company if I have more money.

hma8f5h,SeaworthinessOk4046,11/27/2021,1,Some hopefully useful insights to deferred compensation plans:  * youre deferring compensation from this year to some future years(s) that you get to pick.  Note that you pay payroll taxes on this compensation the year its earned (social security medicare)-- the tax on this compensation that you are deferring is the federal income tax.  the net here is that it reduces your income this year-- and hence your tax burden. * in my experience (private sector) you can not access deferred comp until the previously picked distribution dates.   * check out what investment options you have for DC Ive seen some where its a fixed percent per year and others where one can choose between a couple of investment options. * the DC grows tax free (like a 401k) until it gets distributed.   * You pay federal tax (and not payroll) when its distributed. * Id double check on these:    * If you are still employed with the company the year  some of your DC might be distributed you can choose to again defer it    * If you are let go of the company you may have the ability to further define how your DC is distributed one last time.  Just one other comment on the kid entering college you might considerI  bonds.  Youre limited to 10k (15k if you get tax refund) per year and the interest is adjusted for inflation.  right now its paying 7.12%.  The downside is you cant access for a year you lose the last 3 months of interest if you cash it in before 5 years and the interest rate is adjustable.   But you pay no state/local tax and if you use it for educational expenses you pay no federal taxes on it.
hmcyybi,oxford_b,11/27/2021,1,Bummer. Best thing to do is ask the doctor to offer you a reasonable rate reduction if one wasn’t already applied assuming they are in network. If that fails I’d call the office and offer $200 and tell them that’s all the money you have
hm9rkph,swampler22,11/27/2021,1,Well that sucks. And thats whats confusing to me. If its my 401k which is pre tax why would they tax this amount and then proceed to give it to me. Why not just leave the full amount?

hma0lt9,matto_2008,11/27/2021,1,Is your 401k maxed? I recently received a 13% raise and before it became effective I raised my 401k contribution 10% which after my year end raise will have me maxing for 2022.  Do you have a Roth IRA? If not you can open one and put it 6k a year. This money will grow tax free and your contributions (not your gains) can be pulled out anytime to be used for anything. If after a couple years you want it for a house go for it. If you keep receiving raises and don’t need to touch that money even better!
hmb4ciu,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,Just to put into perspective what the two of you are arguing over.  20K at 0.5% is $100 per year.  Thats $8.33/month.  Then subtract taxes as applicable to your situation.  Can you see how youre arguing over less than $100/yr?
hmcxnrn,hedrone,11/27/2021,1,This.  When I needed a down payment for a house I made sure to include all of my stinkers in the stock I sold to make the down payment.  The losses offset some of the gains for tax purposes.

Yes she learned on the job but she’s done so with no training and no support. that’s a far cry from being ready to build and lead a team.   OP if I were you I wouldn’t take the NP job but look for other positions where you could be part of a team and focus in on the parts of the job you do like.  So paid search or marketing automation or content marketing or analytics etc
hmcsaqn,crimxxx,11/27/2021,1,Well from an idea stand point you save money cause you can split housing costs like you would with a roommate and you can consolidate certain individual things to either be one (like say a car if you can work that out)  or buy in bulk for food. Basically there can definitely be pluses here. And depending where you live sometimes the government lets you get certain tax advantages unless you know for sure u have that I would assume nine though.  The flip side is if you can’t come to an agreement on how money is saved and spent you’ll probably get a divorce. Money is one of the leading causes of splitting up. What one side thinks is acceptable does not always line up and that can very easily result in being in a very poor financial situation.  On the other hand
hmbb0c4,lig710,11/27/2021,1,I would think any parent would understand that circumstance.  Especially with the amount of money and time that goes into a PhD
hm8yabb,assertivelyconfused,11/27/2021,13,I’m not I meant that a $50000 capital gain would be taxed at 20% netting him $40000.    $200k/yr in California ~37% of paycheck goes to taxes.  Edit: the capital gain rate he’d pay is actually more likely to be 15%
hmcldkb,Valendorf,11/27/2021,1,Usually you need multiple years of tax returns showing a stable income at the rate you are at and other supporting documentation to prove that your income isn’t going to change drastically in the short term.  Most banks don’t want to deal with the extra effort.

hmc6qwi,westbee,11/27/2021,1,Ive been job searching everyday since Ive left college.  No reason not to network or see whats out there.   Every once and awhile I will find something and do interviews.  I find being satisfied where I am gives me confidence to ask the needed questions to find out more and even gain experience interviewing.   Just tell your boss that are heard of job opportunities and was curious. Be honest and say what you would like to see more at work. For instance: i would like to work from home is that a possibility?

hm9f8if,dj_benito,11/27/2021,-7,IMO its a perfect job for a young person looking to break into the workforce. You rely on him for the skills youre learning and the paycheck and he relies on your good work ethic and ever increasing abilities.   For now it keeps money in your pocket to cover the essentials. Its also a way to understand what the working world is like and learn some skills. Eventually you may earn a raise for reliability and good results or you can take what youve learned and use it to land a better position elsewhere.

hmb5rus,o2msc,11/27/2021,1,I think a factor would be how much do you have in those retirement accounts at 50? If you won’t necessarily “need” the “other” $200000 for retirement then you could definitely pay off your primary residence. Or you could sell the investment property likely pay off your current house and truly be 100% debt free without touching your investments. That’s what I would do.

hm8zqu8,blackmambasniper,11/27/2021,2,What do I tell them though? Like wouldnt they say im at fault or I would get penalized for having an accident?
hmcbbrr,ooglieguy0211,11/27/2021,1,Yeah but remember that the guys and gals who show up on what could be one of the worst times in your life are the scummy ones. It could always be worse they could just not do their job and let all the crashed cars pile up on the roadways.   In the state I live in and have worked towing in you dont have a choice to drive a car with airbag deployment but you can choose the tow company if you have one that can respond within the allotted time to clear the accident. The police will call tow companies on a rotating list unless you tell them otherwise.  Where towing companies get the worst rap is from the repo side and the parking enforcement side. Almost nobody gets mad when the AAA or other road club guy shows up to help them out. Things like lockouts also make people mad because of the cost. I can open your locked door without damaging the vehicle with the right tool (not just the long reach and an air wedge because thats cheating) within 30 seconds most often. You are going to pay for the expertise. While we are on the subject of payment in an accident call (police call for a tow truck) in my state the rates are set by the state not the company. All the fees for that type of tow storage fuel surcharge and lot fees including even after hours fees are set by the state legislature to avoid unfair fees by the scummy companies.
hmbbbkb,veritasgt,11/27/2021,1,You’re overcomplicating this. $1-200 wouldn’t impact your current lifestyle let alone the post-raise one. Spend a little more on the house you want. If you want to sell this one in a few years and buy another the transaction costs alone will be more than the price difference now. Don’t be penny wise and pound foolish.

hmae28i,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,15k in savings on 1M worth of property seems too small though you may be counting on equity in the case of needing large repairs. The 1.5% rule says 1M of property produces 15k of property upkeep leaving you with no personal savings in case of job loss.   By forgoing 401(k) or other retirement savings in favor of real estate investing youre allocating money to a small real estate business you own. That business is already a the majority of your net worth with a little split between the personal home and 401k.  Since your income might lapse with the career change risk I would prioritize paying down expensive debt (vehicle loan %?) and building up liquid savings. Once that is done look at the career change and increasing retirement savings.   Heres a ten minute video discussing real estate investing verses other assets - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rvY2rIxdsA
hmb4543,thememeconnoisseurig,11/27/2021,1,It is never too late youre still younger than the age when most people start investing. Your money will just pile up in a checking account it wont grow.
hmagsg7,ploetzlichbanana,11/27/2021,1,Thats good general information thank you. I dont think we will be able to leverage exactly the same structure as US trust-funds here in Europe so my next move will be to have a look on how one can setup an investment account on behalf of someone else. Again taxation might be a show-stopper here. But from I gather from your post in any case I should seek legal advice and make sure that the person giving it is competent in the various jurisdictions.  Another option could be to trust the parents to set it right in their respective countries of residence but I like this option less.
hmc9d1x,moneypenny88,11/27/2021,1,Yes. I should have made it more clear. Pay it to zero then charge something again like gas or groceries staying in the 1-5% letting it post then paying in full each month.  This will make sure there’s no more interest charged.

hmbbzqv,FutureBarrySeal,11/27/2021,1,Capital gains would only be on the profit of the property. So unless I’m missing something which I’m pretty sure I am it will be a capital gains tax on $500k. Long term capital gains tax so should be around $100k on the total sale. Aka walk away with $3.9m most likely.
hmbgop4,toodlesandpoodles,11/27/2021,1,If your goal for saving is to save as much as as possible youll never reach it and always be miserable. You need to sit down and determine what you are saving money for the sacrifices you are making to do it and whether or not it is worth it.  I grew up saving money for college and spending very little and when I started working I shifted to saving money for retirement. Initially I didnt have a well-defined goal of what this meant. This made it difficult for me to spend any money. Once I decided the age I wanted to retire how much money I needed to retire at this age and what I would need to save for it to conservatively grow to this amount then I felt freed up to just spend any extra money.

hmbuxm6,SuchLovelyLilacs,11/27/2021,1,I think thats situation-dependent. My BIL and SIL recently divorced after 24 years of marriage. At the time of their divorce they had just one minor child and had shared custody so no child support. BIL has a successful career in marketing. SIL has had a spotty work history over her life and no real career trajectory. BIL is paying SIL alimony for 10 years. Kind of crappy IMO but she did support him as he climbed the career ladder. So SIL was 46 when they divorced. Shes been unemployed/underemployed for the past 2 years and basically living on the alimony. She now has 8 years of alimony left no appreciable retirement savings and no real career prospects. Her alimony will run out when she is 56. Not sure what kind of job shell find at 56 or if shell find one at all. I feel she basically shot herself in the foot with this divorce financially.  OTOH my BIL continues to work in his field has gotten a promotion and a substantial raise in the past 2 years. He will most likely continue to work earning a six-figure salary for the next 15-20 years. He has healthy retirement savings purchased a home outright. His daughter is already graduated from college (already paid for) and his two sons have opted not to go to college. Basically hes sittin pretty financially for the rest of his days barring any kind of illness or disability (for which he has insurance).   I really fear for how things are going to pan out for my SIL in the long-term unless she remarries (which she may well do).

hmckw1g,Melodic-Winter-7863,11/27/2021,1,No parents own a good amount of rental properties so I expect guidance from them when It comes down to anything RE related
hmc1xq7,hopingtothrive,11/27/2021,1,Read some of the messy breakups on Reddit when unmarried people own property together. Even if you break up there is nothing to force either to sell the house buy each other out or move out of the house. With a divorce the judgement is enforceable. Property ownership with unrelated people is riskier.  So it is a financial concern.
hmcx8j3,muffalowing,11/27/2021,1,You change so much as a person from the time youre 21 to even just 25. I would wait for no other reason than that alone. You dont need to be in a rush.
hmc2dp9,Gilbert_Sanchez,11/27/2021,1,Mmm I mean it’s expensive where your spouses issues are you issues. Like if your spouse gets sick you have to protect them in that situation along with yourself. You are their family now.   It’s cheap though cause their money is your money. Like I make ok money on my own but with my wife we make a ton of money. So it cuts both ways I think.   But I agree with your sisters idea. You need to be a full person on your own: emotionally physically financially etc before you’re married.

hm9rg02,WebbieVanderquack,11/27/2021,2,>You had kids when you couldnt afford to  Sounds like she could afford them at the time. People who have children dont usually assume their partner might leave them and withhold child support.
hmc4tga,nutoreddit,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the detailed answer. I have funds in taxable accounts in SWPPX. I guess I was wondering if I just continue to load that in the coming years or move to VTSAX. Seems there is no real reason and I still have options within Schwab funds.
hmbr0x2,Edard_Flanders,11/27/2021,1,The negatives as far as I can see include: 1. Every open account has some potential for fraud - Even if you wouldn’t be on the hook fighting fraud requires a lot of paperwork. 2.  In order to open an account they have to do a credit inquiry which will have a short term negative effect on your credit. 3.  Just having another card gives you one more thing you have to keep up with.
hmaukux,youngsimba320,11/27/2021,1,Ok got it thanks
hm8w937,eswolfe0623,11/27/2021,116,A few years ago bank tellers were making minimum wage while also  being expected to sell/upsell products. Im out of the business now and have done all my banking online since 2019.   Tellers are generally poorly trained and underpaid. And they deal with rude impatient people all day. Management has lost sight of the fact that tellers telephone support and the online banking systems ARE  the bank to most people.
hmd02bb,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,Because anybody with a printer and some blank checks purchased from an office supply store can print a legit looking cashier’s check.  Dealerships take cashier’s checks because they still have all of your information and also have the resources to go after anyone who tries to pass off a fake check.
hmatfrw,TheJoshWatson,11/27/2021,1,Personally I would just hold onto it.  I live in an area that just a few years ago was considered to be kind of useless undeveloped land. It was dirt cheap and no one wanted to buy here.  Then suddenly several tech companies built new campuses here and now it’s booming. The  lots here are selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars per acre some for millions.  So it might take a long time even more than your lifetime. But land is a finite resource there’s only so much to go around on the earth. So eventually that area will probably be developed even if it is  a hundred years from now.  So personally if someone left me some land I would just hold onto it especially for $25/year.   Another relevant story: my friend purchased 30 acres of undeveloped land to put a vacation cabin on. He bought it three years ago for like $25k and now that land is worth around $300k. He just had it appraised recently when land in the area suddenly went up in price.  He’s going to keep it because the prices are still going up and he still wants a vacation cabin.  My point is you really never know with land. But it will basically never go down in value. Land is a really really good long term investment.
hmcz4x7,Kevin4938,11/27/2021,1,At 21 and 22 Id be inclined to say wait a few years. You re just starting out things will be tough at times and the stress may take its toll on the relationship.  As for whether its expensive Ive been married for almost 30 years and Im still paying for it )
hmabxct,jorge1209,11/27/2021,1,I would caution that the Airlines are in very bad position financially after COVID and are changing their policies all the time to try and bring in revenue. There is a decent amount of risk with a miles card if you dont have a plan to spend those miles quickly.
hma2b2i,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,No because I dont live in the same county as the university that I attend.
hmauuqs,Buttigieg2032,11/27/2021,1,At a certain point long tail risks because so improbable they really arent worth worrying about.  Theres plenty of cases too where a 6 month emergency fund will fail too but we dont all have 2 year emergency funds instead to protect against that long tail risk. Eventually the costs outweigh the benefits.
hmbyz5a,lucky_ducker,11/27/2021,1,He can create an account on [ssa.gov](https://ssa.gov) where he can see his earnings history and future benefit projections. Caveat: the benefit projections are calculated assuming you will continue to earn an inflation-adjusted wage equivalent to your most recent years reported income. So if retirement is a long way off take the estimates with a grain of salt as your earnings may fluctuate (or stop). Im 3 to 7 years away from retirement and will likely stay in the same position Im in until then - so the estimates are starting to firm up for me.
hmcdxwi,newaccount721,11/27/2021,1,Yeah it reads to me like OPs boss was trying to work with him to make current job better and OP took that as an implicit threat. Cant tell if OP knows more and is correctly reading the situation or if he is disproportionately concerned about having a resume online
hmcvsf6,titleywinker,11/27/2021,1,This is the right answer. It is literally what your tax preparer will do if they’re good. If they’re ok they’ll look at the gross amounts you gave and say “don’t file separately.”
hmao9uo,bmoreboy410,11/27/2021,1,The earlier you save/invest the money the more time that it has to grow. The longer you wait the less it will grow.
hmb4nm4,iamedreed,11/27/2021,1,find the payroll manager and email them directly (I assume you have a company directory or some way to search names and emails?) if that doesnt work find the controller if that doesnt work CHRO/CFO.  what is your manager doing to help you? if this happened to one of my employees I would be doing all of the above for them.
hm90ktx,Valianttheywere,11/27/2021,-5,Definate fraud. Possibly a hacker who wants you to contact them back.
hmby5kn,MovieJunior,11/27/2021,1,Past results aren’t indicative of future success especially if you’re in lesser known alt coins without significant backing.  I wouldn’t wager 24.99% interest on what may never occur and if it does could take well over a year or more.

hmav9jv,KarlClausewitz,11/27/2021,1,Ask if they’ll month-to-month lease. It likely will cost more in the short term but should allow you to find a new place and not lock you in for another year.
hmb8pdt,International_Arm843,11/27/2021,1,If you dont want to deal with the hassle just put it in SPY i wouldnt want someone picking individual stocks with my money.
hmaplcf,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,Call the hospital have them help you apply for Medicaid. They pay for up to 3 months prior if qualified. If not qualified  apply for the ACA to prevent future $35K bills.   Negotiate and set up a payment plan with the hospital and physicians (often not included in hospital bill). Then set up a go fund me page.   If a small  rural hospital  you might try the hardball tactic of negotiating under threat of declaring bankruptcy where the hospital will likely never see a dime. Theyre pretty desperate and barely hanging on.   Im glad it wasnt serious. But you know very well next time it could be.   Seriously gi through the entire ACA process  right up to the final sign up screen. I bet youre pleasantly surprised at the cost after the advanced tax credits (often called federal subsidies).
hmcs428,Rainbow-Death,11/27/2021,1,Ok
hmatp8t,Scr0bD0b,11/27/2021,1,Coming from someone with zero risk or knowledge of her actual career maybe she should start saying No more often.  Managements lack of ability to staff properly shouldnt be her problem.  Once-in-awhile coverage is fine but long term is probably taking advantage of her.  If shes getting paid hourly and gets OT maybe its *more* worth it for her but...idk.
hm9h8zu,yut777_,11/27/2021,0,Yeah I probably should appreciate how lucky I am to even get a job. Thanks for the comment.
hmclf6a,Smokey_Katt,11/27/2021,1,This is all totally correct.  The chargeback and fraud prevention is very important.  A group of us went to a restaurant and split the bill paid on my credit card and her debit card.  They charged each of us an extra $200 (fraud waiter was crooked).  I didn’t have to pay she had a terrible hassle getting her money back.
hm9p0lu,swampler22,11/27/2021,1,Check amount was $716.87 after taxes. My bad.
hm9to87,txholdup,11/27/2021,1,No matter how bad the investment options are 100% match is free money that nobody can afford to pass on.  Just agree with your father and keep the 6% going in.  Secondly these are not retirement accounts.  They are tax sheltered wealth building accounts.  The best time to build wealth is when you are young.  Dont pass on free money.
hmch0en,scalenesquare,11/27/2021,1,Weddings are expensive. Marriage is not.

hmcy4nv,949goingoff,11/27/2021,1,CPA here. Getting a referral from a colleague would be the best option. You could also find a ranking of firms in your area by size and start calling around. Larger firms are going to be more expensive but they will also be the most knowledgeable.
hmb7j4t,blondie401,11/27/2021,1,Also want to add that it doesn’t have to be all or nothing. If you are very passionate about paying down some debt and don’t want to leave the full $200k in your account maybe consider taking half out and paying down one of the mortgages. A little bit of a hedge if you are skeptical of the market crashing in the next couple years.
hmcc4ji,BrightNooblar,11/27/2021,1,The question you need to ask is do you think your boss is operating in good faith? Trust your gut on that and dont let other people tell you what your boss is like.  &#x200B  If you think the boss is operating in good faith Id say reply that youd like to take the training and as your role starts to expand with new tasks due to new expertise then start training someone to take over the old tasks. Then ask about making yourself the supervisor for the new person and what would that position change entail in terms of job title.  &#x200B  Now your resume shows active growth youve gotten your training covered youve put it into practice and youve got experience with having a direct report. All good things for the next new role.
hmcn1xq,WookieMonsterTV,11/27/2021,1,I’m a firm believer that saving for retirement (including early retirement if you can) is incredibly important but being happy now is just as if not more important.   I pay for maids to clean my house twice a month $350 bucks total for it but worth every single penny. I get new clothes at goodwill! The key is getting the clothes tailored to fit tailors are fairly cheap but great fitting clothes makes all the difference!  Maybe go to a dermatologist a few times to learn how to care for your skin at home. If it improves how you think and live it’s worth it
hmcx50l,BruceCourteous4444,11/27/2021,1,Come again?
hmckn33,listairee,11/27/2021,1,Wow I didnt know that theres a lot of people interested on this. No I do not have a blog for this though I should probably start one knowing that there are so many interested people.   But my goal is a simple one. I simply commit to using a portion of profit from my business for investment in this land stewardship project. :)

hmacdgu,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,Ive tried to figure out our taxable income but theres too many variables. I know that our gross income is $100k (41k for me 59k for husband) so the standard deduction of 25k would put us at 75k regardless of what is taken out in 401(k) taxes etc.
hmbr6ur,BruceCourteous4444,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for the recommendation. Are these two funds enough? Would you recommend just these two funds?

hmbimge,Motobugs,11/27/2021,1,Rib can wait. Focus on your job first.
hmbwxqt,Lethalmouse1,11/27/2021,1,Well that why I said assuming no late payments/paid off. The kind of financial behavior Id imagine we do when we care enough to hook up our kids credit. Good credit card + 5 years + turns 18. I mean I have to wait a few years to find out but I could just tell people then... but I cant time travel lol.
hmavzl4,Getmybaby,11/27/2021,1,Never agree to an automatic renewal. If you gave that permission in the original lease then let them know that you intend to let the lease expire.  Next time you sign a less contract sign it all rights reserved. Hidden contracts are a real thing.  That being said call the lease manager and find out if you can negotiate.
hmcu2z5,ERTBen,11/27/2021,1,YMMV. I bought with my gf and we just bought our second as husband and wife.
hma7sd2,AndPlus,11/27/2021,1,Im invested in ESGV (Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF). Its done fairly well in the period I have owned it (less than a year). However when you look at the top 10 portfolio holdings you see that it resembles that of VOO VTI or VGT. So it makes sense that it is doing well when youre holding top performers of the SP500.   Be careful what is sold as ESG. Its a vague term. If it is truly your goal then you might have better luck with individual ESG-focused companies rather than buying a basket.
hmbdfuh,FutureBarrySeal,11/27/2021,1,Not a good idea… especially in this market. If your bills are less than $500 a month and you can’t manage to save or pay down debt selling the car is only going to enable that behavior. Even if you did pay it down you’d just get yourself back in debt because you have no control. Here’s something you can try… I’m sure those apps let you do instant cash out right? Every day you work and make Money cash out and put 70-80% of it towards debt immediately. Toss the other cards for now so you aren’t tempted to use them. You’ll see the progress within a month and hopefully be motivated to pay it off. Take it from Some of us older folks you’re going down a bad path and you’re young enough to catch it young and fix it. You don’t want to wake up and be 40 one day with severe debt and no savings. Good luck
hm8vo47,SkepticAquarian876,11/27/2021,1,Can it all be held in a trust fund with out it being taxed again when they are older? Trust fund sounds better.

hmd2dpk,optimaloptimist101,11/27/2021,1,Check out the Citi Premier. You and P2 can each get one for 80k points (worth a minimum $800) after spending 4k in the first 3 months. Can be downgraded to the Double Cash with no AF after Year 1.   There are cards with bigger bonuses but higher annual fees that are probably not worth getting unless you can take advantage of all the credits and benefits plus youd have to be down for transferring points to partners and all that.   Feel free to ask any questions.

hmanesz,aim4harmony,11/27/2021,1,Thanks. What is HELOC? I consider a gig work and seek for a new permanent job too. Honestly my student loan was delayed for a few years and recently I got a letter from collectors which means the institution was not satisfied with the proposed payment plan. The student loan is the only type that haunts all the time and does not expire.
hmcyit9,LetsBeCoolMan,11/27/2021,1,For FHA or conventional
hmcgs0u,kiralite713,11/27/2021,1,That is really interesting. As far as I know theyre the same types of retirement vehicles other than the tax codes they fall under 403B usually being for Non Profits and 401K for profit companies.   Thank you for an interesting question.
hmaw6lz,Tiafves,11/27/2021,1,Plus at 6% for 52k a year thats basically 3000 a year.  If you cant build up an emergency fund and contribute that at the same time your emergency is things like you lost your job like 2 months in so basically paid nothing into your 401k anyway or had a medical emergency that would deplete your savings no matter how large they are.
hmb9wun,tiedyesmiley,11/27/2021,1,Being a healthcare professional I went the same route as you with the DNR status lol

hmcty6w,Environmental_Put_33,11/27/2021,1,Anything above 4% on a car note of that size is worth paying off right away if you have the funds. If the rate is less then put the money into something else that will make you more than 4% which is pretty much most index funds in this bull market.
hmbo279,LittleGirlTeethMeme,11/27/2021,1,I would gently suggest living together and not getting married until age 25+. Lots of evidence that our brains are still maturing until around age 25 and marriage failure rate is significantly higher in those who marry before age 25 vs. those who marry at 25+. You’ll also likely be more financially secure by that age or at least have an idea of some major life goals/career trajectory (might be done with any formal education etc.). Divorce can be VERY expensive. Avoid it if you can!
hmairs4,WolverineTherapy,11/27/2021,1,Did you live through 2008 as an adult?  If so you learned nothing.
hm9saue,pestowitch,11/27/2021,1,Keep in mind that math is based on the expensive plan you laid out here. It would be much cheaper to spend a year self teaching and passing a few udemy certificates be honest with yourself if you are understanding the material. Set a specific block of time to do it like 9-12am Saturday and Tuesday nights 7-9pm just as an example. If you can do that with sustained self motivation for year then consider paying for a boot camp.
hmb64rn,o2msc,11/27/2021,1,You’re not too late. If anything you’re still ahead of the game at 25. You do need to learn the basics though. There is a difference between saving and investing. Money you invest in the stock market is for the future. Money you keep in your bank accounts is for everyday/short term use.

hmd0etn,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,Compounding doesn’t really apply to stock holdings.  Gains are just that. Today a share of a stock with worth $X. Hopefully when it’s time to sell they’re worth significantly more than $X.
hmbs3ha,BastidChimp,11/27/2021,1,Yay for no student loans! You can also now invest aggressively in the stock market not hassled by student debt. Build up your credit by using no annual fee credit cards. Use them only for essential purchases like gas and food. Pay off its balance every month.

hm9m5eq,CyberVolks,11/27/2021,0,Did you check your bank statements? The money gets debited from you somewhere. You can send a rent check through the mail and it could end up lost or stolen. Just because you sent the check doesn’t mean you’re paid up. Auto pay is drawn from where you make your deposits. Chase is just proving the service. Check your bank.
hm8vbu7,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,1,Lol worked in sports in 2019 as an account executive making 50k total after crushing goals and working insane hours in season (baseball). People who aren’t on the field playing or coaching don’t make the $. Then found a company that was willing to invest in my potential in tech (I manage partnerships). I probably applied to 80-100 companies networking like crazy trying to break into this industry from sports. Started off as an associate making 90k starting in Feb 2020 then got a promotion putting me at $120k in April. I also coach vball on the side so that is another $400 a month from now til May I need to plan for coming in. I’ve been #blessed.
hmbx4w8,terpischore761,11/27/2021,1,58k is the limit for all contributions for the year. Employee can contribute up to 19.5k into 401k. 6K in IRA’s. Employer can contribute up to 32.5k to max out contributions for the year.
hmafh4o,S54e36er,11/27/2021,1,Yea you will need to sell your American funds as vanguard will not hold another mutual fund company’s funds.  Not sure if you will need to sell post or ore transfer.  I’d call vanguards customer service line.  Not sure what you mean by vanguard will replace the same funds as they are two separate companies with different funds. For fees best to call vanguard customer service for those questions
hmd8jdm,yoyogogo111,11/27/2021,1,If you hold a negative balance for long enough (by paying a bill then returning an item for example as others have described) the cc company will often just send you a check for the balance so they’re no longer carrying that liability on their books. Usually 3-6 months depending on the company. So even if you manage to do this (which is probably not the best idea as others have pointed out but not necessarily actively harmful) be aware of that time limit.
hmcgry4,metalguysilver,11/27/2021,1,You’re obviously correct but if a there is a crash and you have a financial emergency around the same time (they correlate) you are taking a hit. You aren’t wrong as I said. Less than three would still be stupid
hmbeklh,MtNowhere,11/27/2021,1,I really think your sister is right. Financial independence is important. From experience I can also tell you that major shifts in lifestyle changes people greatly. The two of you may be cool with spending forever with each other right now but aspirations change once people get deeper into a career.  Theres nothing wrong with commiting to each other as non-married couple.
hmad1f3,Annabel398,11/27/2021,1,Well you use a broker when you have non-standard income precisely because they have a network that goes beyond “stick to the guidelines” bank guys. That said if your dad gets a loan he’s probably going to have a higher APR on it.  Btw suggesting your dad reduce his SS *for the rest of his life* so he can buy a house today is a shit move and a good indicator that maybe dad should be talking to a different broker.
hmagd8o,Legosmiles,11/27/2021,1,I’d like to point out that you being on the mortgage and you being listed with your husband on the house title are usually separate and that’s final word should it come to a divorce.
hmc8aq3,RandomAngeleno,11/27/2021,1,Eh we dont have enough information and from what OP stated about the lower workload and shared responsibilities Id say the $3k is quite possibly worth lower stress especially in terms of mental and physical health.  I agree that a counter-offer for the new job to match the current compensation is in order but the overall benefits package differences in commutes etc. could all tip the balance either way.
hmcms66,freesecj,11/27/2021,1,Where do you live in the US?   Here’s a job listing in MN:  https://walkerart.hiringthing.com/job/341472/project-photographer
hmc92y1,sfratini,11/27/2021,1,I am not based in the US but from I have read the good ratio to spend on a house is about 3-4 times your annual salary so you guys are actually below that mark. If I were you I would spend the extra 100 if the difference in house quality is substantial. Also keep in mind you will most likely need 20-40k in house renovations in the first two years. Leaks AC etc.   At the end of the month if you can save about 30% of the income then you are doing great.   Also don’t think you are forced to buy a house right now. Yes the market is specially good to buy something. But it is also acceptable to focus on paying your current debts (car and students loans) instead of adding more debt into the situation.    Personally I hate debts so I tend to avoid them as much as possible. I would probably focus one year to settle the other debts keep saving to be able to add a larger down payment or emergency fund and then buy the house.   But hey at the end of the day is about what you feel right. I have a frugal life and I am an aggressive saver. Which means I pass on having a better lifestyle but at the same time I am very peaceful knowing that if something happens I can wait and even keep my current lifestyle for a long time. Adding more debts only get you more stress.
hmc70me,mbishop196,11/27/2021,1,They wanted me to tell the bank I gave them 2k and give them 2k over time. At the point of sale I gave the dealership 200.
hmac5a8,JhihnX,11/27/2021,1,No it isn’t arbitrary it’s based on the USDA’s (generally) liberal food plans and some rounding.  I’ve bothered with rounding and adjusting for household size which puts the estimate at $1002.44.  But a budget for groceries really does not need to be so complicated as to need every detail.
hmcx78l,tossme68,11/27/2021,1,On the other hand being able to carry the others weight for an extended period is a massive advantage.  If someone gets sick they dont have to work while getting better. If someone loses their job the couple wont lose the house.   Saving for retirement is easier and all sorts of other advantages.

hmbkqr0,baddad49,11/27/2021,1,probably not...at your age insurance rates are based primarily on your age...sucks but its true  you dont mention what kind of car but that does play into it a little bit sometimes...i.e.: muscle cars trucks and other flashy type vehicles will garner a higher premium  after 25 you should be able to get a lower rate if you continue to have a clean driving record and a modest car

hmd1eig,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,The check will appear to clear in a couple days but the bank can still claw back funds weeks later if it comes back as fraudulent.  Most people will see the check clear in a couple days assume everything’s good and hand over the car. In fact AFAIK there’s no way to know for sure when you are in the clear and completely safe.
hmbft8a,lainey822,11/27/2021,1,Lets just agree to disagree.  Why would other peoples experiences have anything to do with math? You either are house poor or you are not.  Simple as that. Clearly OP is stressed about being house poor because he is extending beyond this rule.  So I agree that his risk of being house poor is higher when hes stretching beyond 3x.  Math is still math.

hmc0m0n,_iamacat,11/27/2021,1,I guess...  - Level of coverage - Length of driving experience - seems like insurance companies DO NOT factor in learner’s permit time. Unsure about provisional time. When did you get off your provisional?  - insurance covers YOUR ass if you hurt or damage someone else’s stuff getting yours fixed is a rare  bonus.  - Deer population...  - Drunk driving statistics - Weather statistics  If the vehicle is over 10 Y/O high mileage and not a very interesting model it may be a good idea to drop coll/comp and raise your liability...

My bf and I want to get married but we’re way too young and don’t have the capabilities rn so we are aiming for after college.
hma66hw,fullactualization,11/27/2021,1,Interesting. In the US you can print for free at public libraries and most folks have printers at home. I’m guessing that’s not the case where you’re from? Yeah a cheap tablet could be a good idea & you can highlight and write notes on it.

hmakihr,WolverineTherapy,11/27/2021,1,Call them and negotiate.  No insurance company pays that much.  Medicare takes a machete to bills like that.  They make a profit nonetheless.  Theyll offer you a payment plan on $35k.  Tell them you need the bill reduced.  Get them to reduce it twice before considering agreeing to a payment plan.
hmcfpk9,abominablesnowperson,11/27/2021,1,I was in a similar situation. Take the pay cut. Sounds like you’ll be a lot happier. You can also ask the non-profit org if there’s any wiggle room to meet you at 50k. An extra $3k to get you to come on isn’t a whole lot in the grand scheme of things from their side but it could mean the difference to you in saying yes to the role right away.

hmayhdk,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,> What leverage do I have in this situation?    Pretty much the only leverage you have is they wouldnt have to look for a new tenant. However if theyre anything like the lessor Im using a new tenant would pay more than $1196.02 anyway. For example Im paying around $1350/mo after a $70 increase...but if I were a new tenant just moving in it would be closer to $1500-1600 for the same space. Literally the only reason my lease increase is less than that is because it saves them lost rent from waiting for a tenant and such.    So the only leverage you have they may already be accounting for (by charging a new tenant $1400 or something instead of the $1200 theyre charging you). They may be viewing the raise to $1200 as a break to you for remaining a tenant - which means you effectively have zero leverage outside of any state regulations in place due to Covid.    You can always try negotiating with them just dont think you have some automatic unquestionable way into getting out of the increase. Unfortunately thats the risky side of renting....you could always buy and your mortgage itself will stay static for 30 years or so (depends on the term) though there are other costs associated that can change from year to year.
hmasfhn,Ecstatic_Assumption5,11/27/2021,1,apparently I talked to the police and bank and the check had the logo of a bank while the routing number was from a different bank
hmb7z8m,Mezzylu,11/27/2021,1,On a similar point sis might be thinking more like advising op to become capable of supporting herself before she ends up totally dependent upon her BF to make ends meet.   Once upon a time women went from parents to husband with no emphasis on self sufficiency. If you end up divorced after that you may find yourself initially helpless unless you get a big divorce settlement.   That being said having someone that has your back in everything financial and otherwise massively reduces the stress of life. Just be on the same page.
hmd3f2f,lenswipe,11/27/2021,1,My favorite example of this is when you buy shit at the dollar store and they try to upsell you on a warranty. Like....these fairy lights cost $5. If they break Ill just buy more Im not buying a warranty on that lmao.

hmaavfo,shea_harrumph,11/27/2021,1,no. youre raiding the 401k to get from 16% to 20% down. an 84% LTV loan will have a correspondingly low PMI and youll be very close to the 78% required for it to drop off.

hmcszfu,1nd3x,11/27/2021,1,>Dig yourself into debts that could have been totally avoided?  Sure...if you could afford building yourself a bigger emergency fund by all means.  If you can afford to do something today but chose not to because what if I cant afford it later then youre going to live your whole life doing nothing.  Consider how long it may take for the individual to develop a proper emergency fund versus the increase in costs of the things that they are trying to buy and utilize.  &#x200B  Should you not buy a house today because you dont already have an emergency fund? Or should you buy a house today and then continue to build your emergency fund over time while you play a little bit of the risk game at the start when youre young and can bounce back from catastrophic finances....the same way I dont expect to have $1000000 in my retirement savings account before I take my very first Vacation because the thing Im saving for may never happen(retirement or an emergency) in which case all that money sat there needlessly/wastefully when you could have enjoyed its benefits today. and...god forbid the cost of taking that vacation may increase to a point where in waiting until I had all my retirement savings money(emergency fund) Ive simply priced myself out of the market of Vacations(buying a home) because they just got too expensive.
hmc440s,ardranor,11/27/2021,1,If an employee is that integral to the success of a project or projects its probably in the employers best interest to pay a commensurate salary to keep the employee. If they want to leave then the employer has failed to keep them.
hmdajor,sweeteleven,11/27/2021,1,you could post in r/sales and see if theres any advice there from other sales professionals.
hmb8pei,Nicedumplings,11/27/2021,1,As a land manager who is on the receiving end of wetland parcels like this I have a few words of advice.   Donate it to the local municipality or conservation agency (town/county/state). You’re allowed a tax write off of up to $5000 WITHOUT AN APPRAISAL for donation of property per the IRS.  You could see if there is anyone in the area that buys and sells land like this for hunting purposes or for development rights purposes etc. often times there may be underlying value in the land that the general public doesn’t know about. Maybe call your local municipality and see if they can give you information on the rights the land may have and their value. There are lots of people that will buy land off people like this for cheap and flip it for thousands more.   You can hold on to it. It’s $25/year and there’s the potential it could have higher value in the future. Maybe the state/town/county is buying up the land around it and yours will be a key piece.
hmcxwnj,sasafracas,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for the research.  I couldnt find a good reason either.  I guess comparing it to the imperial system is a good analogy.  How many of the Kings feet are needed for good credit?
hmczkf2,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,I think youll have to either see if theyll increase your credit limit or find another way to pay until you can get it increased. Most CCs are not going to let a charge go through that will put you over your limit-- it will just be declined.
hmcxifr,Nicofatpad,11/27/2021,1,People don’t allocate enough money to their gym memberships honestly and the rates of $10-20 for commercial fitness centers like planet fitness and retro fitness really distorted the value of a gym membership.  People spend around $10-20 on subscriptions they barely use yet wont spend any more on something as important as the gym. To me a $30-40 gym membership at a decent gym that has what you need and maintains their equipment is a great deal. I’ve had memberships in the range of $60-70 for hobbyist powerlifting gyms.  If you’re going at least 2.5-3 times a week a $30-40 membership is well worth it. I’ve also found that memberships in those ranges are easier to cancel…The $10-25 range is usually only that cheap cause they’re capable of scamming people out of their money by making it virtually impossible to cancel thus getting passive income from people who don’t even use their equipment. A proper market price really is $30-40.
hmc7s9l,LordofMud,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for your comment! We will start looking into one.  Do you have any advice on how to go about looking for one? FWIW we are in Brooklyn NY.

hmapol2,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,You cant beat the Prime Directive for solid advice. Your thinking is pretty sound you are just adjusting to a lot of change in a short period. Overall no harm in keeping it simple for now and improving as you learn.  The PD will suggest 3-6 months living  expense as an emergency fund. That basically means cash not investments that can vary in value and not be available nearly immediately. If you dont have that already put the money there first.   Whats not covered in the PD is the specifics to your situation. First unless your wife sets up as a company (complex and probably not worth it) she doesnt have access to a 401k what you (as a couple) can do is contribute up to $6K/year to an IRA in her name.    For 2021 it may make sense to do Roth for 2021 it sounds like you will be in traditional (ie not Roth) territory.    Life tends to get more expensive as soon as money becomes available (ex.: new apartment). By bumping up your retirement funding now (you too can do an IRA for 2021 up until April 2022) you make investing a healthy routine and set yourself up for financial success.
hmcyhjy,MaRy3195,11/27/2021,1,This is definitely an important point. My (now) husband and I got engaged a few months after graduating college but then waited almost 2 years for the actual wedding. By thst point we both had stable income careers and savings. Plus we were able to live together and make some big financial decisions together (picking apartments buying a car buying a house etc). So by the time we actually got married we were very confident in our ability to both support ourselves individually and make decisions together. Its definitely ok to marry young but consider a long engagement maybe to sort some of these items out.
hmc89vg,_cocophoto_,11/27/2021,1,Where in the US are you? Have you considered Real Estate Photography? It’s hard work and you drive your car into the ground but it’s good experience for portfolio building and you can move into other architectural imaging from there.
hmcqvtc,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,The O is more of an extended W that incorporates tha backside of the park by extending the trip 3 days. The backside is also gorgeous but most importantly significantly less crowded than the front W section.   I dont think you can go wrong with either though. If you can manage to get the campsite closest to Las Torres I would also say its worth waking up early and packing your sleeping bags up to take to the top. Watching first light strike them from your sleeping bag is a true moment of serenity.
hmcej4b,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/27/2021,1,Eh putting money in an S&P 500 index fund isn’t really that risky. There are better odds of an asteroid hitting earth and ending humanity than the S&P 500 going to zero. If you need more than three months then just start selling shares in your index fund.
hmblgg3,bobcats2002,11/27/2021,1,$50.00 x 50 = $2500 over the life of the loan that could be saved. $50 isnt much but it adds up and could be used for anything else.   > $250 x 12 = $3000   The car is valued at $7000 as of November 2021. Assuming the insurance isnt again lowered next year Im paying almost 45% of the value of the car. There is no way I come out on top or financially recover from that.
hmb643w,FellowConspirator,11/27/2021,1,(In the US) Marriage is not expensive in its own right. The cost of a marriage license is nominal and thats actually the only part of the process (and returning the signed and witnessed document to record the marriage) is the only real expense -- cheaper than dinner in a fancy restaurant. Anything you add to that is your own business.  Theres no real difference with regard to expenses and in fact some expenses can decrease (for example employer-sponsored benefits are generally cheaper for employee+spouse than they are for each employee too separately get benefits from their respective employers). Once you are married you are a team. You tend to have joint responsibility for your household (finances and otherwise) and enjoy a litany of legal rights with respect to property powers of attorney and other things which can be financially beneficial in many circumstances if they come up.  Whether or not you combine your finances explicitly or not you should be mindful that they become legally intertwined in various ways by marriage regardless (in some states more so than others). The extent to which you keep things separate is really a matter of personal choice and discipline. You will increasingly take on shared responsibility for debts and regular payments together.  My wife and I have our finances joined aside from tax-advantaged retirement accounts which dont support that (though we are primary beneficiaries of one another on our respective plans). All of our bills are paid from a shared pool our investments are in a shared pool all of our real estate is shared etc. In 25 years this has worked pretty well.

hmafohs,fawningandconning,11/27/2021,1,Not everyone who is getting subprime rates defaults on their loans its still only around 10-20% in aggregate. More than made up for by the people who pay in full. Theyre making their money from the near usurious level of interest they are charging people. In many cases over the life of the loan if you have a 16-20%+ interest rate youll pay about half of the principle in interest nearly doubling your cost of what you borrowed.

That’s fine for planning just saying in real life for the next 16 years it could be higher than 10% it could be lower than 10% or it could be exactly 10%. Not everyone gets that. The poster asked if these projections were accurate.  They are not - no one knows what the S&P 500 will return over the next 16 years but you’ve got to start with something to go by so from that perspective save as much as possible and monitor your progress.  Nothing wrong at all with your answer I was just adding to the conversation.
hmag9r3,Pemi1099,11/27/2021,1,Best bet Ive seen on the house is just to have 1 person own it and the other pay rent. Maybe 60/40 split toward the home owner so the person who actually owns it is paying more.
hmclupv,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,Good point but I wont be able to cut down on childcare costs for at least several more years. They already attend the cheapest option in this area and there are a few other factors too.
hmcebo8,Mdly68,11/27/2021,1,When I was a teen I had moderate acne. I tried a few prescriptions but I felt like it was always worse the next day instead of better. I totally get how it can affect self image. But remember most of the world has had acne at one time or another. No adult will ever shame you over acne.  For me what worked is GENTLE face washing twice per day any more than that and Id get dried out. Then I did egg yolk face masks. Let an egg sit on the counter and get warm crack it in half and pass the egg back and forth between shell halves. This cuts off the white and leaves the yolk. Put the yolk on your face and it will dry in about 10 minutes. The idea here is egg yolk has a ton of vitamin A which means healthy skin. Not only does it reduce breakouts your skin will heal faster with less scarring. It made a noticible difference after a month.
hmb8w6q,Fletchonator,11/27/2021,1,Hah no
hmc8n06,gwig9,11/27/2021,1,Its always smart to have a f#ck you Im out plan even after you are married. Whether thats a personal bank account or just a wad of cash stuffed in the bra drawer. It helps you stay out of the situation where you cant afford to leave a partner. I think this might be what your sister is referring to.   Other than that the finances of marriage arent much different from just living together but you may get a slight tax break if you file jointly. Plus fixed expenses like rent can be halved since you are sharing them with another person almost like having a roommate.
hmd6sw2,MediumExplorer,11/27/2021,1,Oh interesting I didn’t think about it that way. Another consideration is that I’m currently single so if I did buy a home it would be a smaller one (max 2500 sq ft no more than 3 bedrooms etc). Sadly even a crappy smaller home in my area goes for $750k+ easy.
hmaum6g,youngsimba320,11/27/2021,1,got it thanks
hmd77c9,doktorhladnjak,11/27/2021,1,It can have some effect. In my community property state (WA) you can’t take out a mortgage without your spouse signing some forms and they become jointly responsible for the debt regardless of being listed on the loan or not. FHA or VA loans require their debt/income included in DTI calculations.
hmbleiv,stupes100,11/27/2021,1,I would consider paying it off but not because of the near term direction of the market. Don’t ever operate out of fear or greed. You might regret your decision. I would pay it off because it is financially wise.
hmb4j4e,reinvestments,11/27/2021,1,No it’s never too late. Some people don’t start until much later or never at all. The reason to invest your money is because of compounding interest. If you just save all of your money in a back account then you will be losing buying power due to inflation and missing out on potential gains from investments. Go read about the bogglehead approach to investing if you want some good and easy informing about what to do with your money.
hmd9khn,newpua_bie,11/27/2021,1,I honestly have never heard of anyone having just 457. Its always 457 in addition to 403b or 401k.
hmbl1lv,SUOrangeGuy,11/27/2021,1,Yes go to ssa.gov and select online services. He will need to create an account for “my social security.” It will provide you all the info you need.
hmb4xj3,xhoi,11/27/2021,1,I wouldnt hold an emergency fund in any kind of investment account. It needs to be basically immediately accessible in order to cover you in tight situations.
hmczhoc,Iustis,11/27/2021,1,> Plus the company match does not count towards your personal IRS contribution limit they are counted separately.  Also companies that pay higher salaries often will have a set up for an automatic contribution of a few percent even if no match.  The effect of this is that the automatic contribution isnt included in the personal limit just the bigger 50kish one.
hmavmxl,jorge1209,11/27/2021,1,You shouldnt buy a car with cash like that. The dealer should accept a cashiers check or certified check and if they wont its because they are going to sell you a lemon and dont want to have a lot of paper records of the transaction.
hmd97yw,anticon1999,11/27/2021,1,Gyms really provide better value per hour than almost any other pastime. Think of the cost of going to a movie bar even a coffee shop.   So I tend to find it pays for itself to a degree as youre not wasting money elsewhere plus the obvious health benefits.
hmcrb0h,doebogan,11/27/2021,1,Thanks. This helps!
hmdanub,ThighOfTheTiger,11/27/2021,1,As much as possible. You have great tax incentives for using retirement accounts you start filling up taxable brokerage once you max out retirement.
hmcqpxx,someoldbikeguy,11/27/2021,1,Its against the law in NY for utilities to be shut off during the winter. You can file a complaint about the billing and threat to shut off utilities at:  https://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/755C4F39A58C924C85257B2F0067FCA5?OpenDocument
hmc1f8m,MovieJunior,11/27/2021,1,So you guys are all just moving.   My above applies then. Find a rental similarly priced to what you’re paying now or if its a matter of not being able to afford the current place then look for a cheaper rental.   Buying is out of the question for you guys. You don’t make enough or have enough or have good enough credit to get a mortgage.
hmbov3b,kovyrshin,11/27/2021,1,If thats your fiance and she is only making $35k now Id so go for better house. Shes vety likely find a better job in the future that will help with house.
hmawbob,diatho,11/27/2021,1,R/militaryfinance will help but if you dont use your tsp youre giving up free money. If you leave you can roll your tsp into a 401k or IRA.
hmb6si0,Orangesunset98,11/27/2021,1,You can try to see if your old plan is eligible for the surprise bill or RAPAS situation. Theres typically a time limit to that too so I would call them ASAP but please be nice as someone who works in insurance an individual person cannot fully control the system
hmc5ehy,jkd-guy,11/27/2021,1,Get an emergency fund of Id say at least a years worth of expenditures since youll be living with your parents.  Once you move out your expenses may go up quite a bit.  Lump sum invest 6k into an IRA. Consider 100% in a S&P 500 fund.  If you are eligible max out and invest in an HSA.  If you can max out your 401k.  However you may want to consider not doing that and investing a fair amount into a taxable account.   Consider not buying a house just because your friends are graduating.  Only buy when you are ready to buy whether the market is up or down.  Pay attention to your fund expenses (ERs administrative etc) especially through your 401k.  Typically they pass most of the fees on to their employees.  Whats most important is that you figure out your overall investment and ***tax*** strategy.  As in if you plan on retiring early you may want to ladder monies from an IRA to a Roth as needed so you get the most tax-efficient outcome.  Also of note just because a vehicle is tax-sheltered doesnt always make it the best option.  Your 401k and IRA monies are locked up until your late 50s.  Only with few exceptions would you be able to withdraw early without penalties.  A taxable account is a great tool to use since it seems like you can easily be well on your way to FIRE.  Use your taxable and tax-sheltered tools to your advantage.
hmb2eb3,meliaesc,11/27/2021,1,I married my high school sweetheart immediately after college. Its my biggest regret.
hma2hl7,Annonymouse100,11/27/2021,1,I know you didn’t ask this but you seem to feel trapped in this business and I think it’s worth taking a step back and looking at the overall picture.   Just because you are an owner does not mean you need to be an employee of the business. At 20k a year you are living in poverty and certainly not supporting a family. You have expressed a desire to get out of the business. Yes you have 70k in personal debt but there is a good chance that given supply chain shortages your equipment is also worth a good bit. You can always approach your business partner/brother with a buyout plan. Or put your foot down and remain an owner (with the liability of the debt and joint decision making) while working a job that is bringing in steady money. Throwing more hours at a business were every hour is losing money/unprofitable will dig you deeper into a hole and there is no reason in the current economy that a well run construction contractor would be losing money. And having one of you working the business instead of working for it is your best chance at turning it around.   The great thing is you have been living on 20k a year. Go get an 80-100k a year job doing structural metalwork for another company. You can pay off the debt (assuming the equipment isn’t liquidated to pay it off because your brother refuses to give up) in less then a year if you live on 20k. The best time to clean up a mess is now.
hmbawtv,thememeconnoisseurig,11/27/2021,1,I just want to make sure I am building up my credit in the fastest most efficient way possible to make sure lack of credit isnt a problem when looking for an investment property in the foreseeable future.

hmd8jt0,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,Make sure to get the out the door price not sticker price and get signed and quoted prices from different dealerships on that vehicle and similar. You can do this over email/call.
hmah9i0,n0radrenaline,11/27/2021,1,Reading this and all your responses I honestly think you should take out student loans. This is essentially an extended emergency situation. You need to be able to focus on what matters: your kids your education. You need to be clear-headed and have resources to deal with whatever else your ex throws at you. Millions of people are dealing with student loan debt its not life-ending.  About the job you currently have: a lot of people are telling you to get a better one but they are likely underestimating the value of the childcare assistance your job gives you (and tbh the value of working for people who are sympathetic to childcare needs like yours). This may well be the best fit for your situation.  *However.* Theres one thing Im hearing that dont like. You seem to be excluding yourself from some of the better-paying jobs because you dont feel qualified and youre not enthusiastic about them.   One: these are entry-level jobs! You are qualified and that voice saying youre not? Thats your abusive exs voice. Plus job descriptions always list more requirements than whats actually required for the job youre supposed to apply anyway and help them figure out whether youve got enough of what they need.  Two: the dirty secret about exchanging ones labor for capital is that youre not gonna love it. If it was fun and meaningful and brought you joy they wouldnt have to pay you to do it. Nobodys out there just *wildly passionate* about insurance adjustment or desktop support or whatever. You look for a job that roughly fits your abilities (good with numbers? outgoing? detail-oriented? thorough? bilingual? etc) and when the interviewers ask why you want this job you just explain how it matches your aptitude/preferences. You dont have to be like ever since I was a tender youth I have dreamt of auditing sales reports for a mid-sized hose and gasket distributor everybody knows thats nobodys passion but they still need somebody to do the work.  Again not saying that you should switch your primary job but if you think it might benefit you at some point Id encourage you not to reject yourself on others behalf.
hmc7rdq,majestrate,11/27/2021,1,If your boss is willing to put you through training they’re investing in you and likely want to keep you around. If they want to let you go but pay for you to get some training first go for it (just don’t sign any kind of retention document that says you have to repay the cost of training if you aren’t around for a set amount of time)
hmbwd4h,atlasc1,11/27/2021,1,Theres more to the story though.  I rent a house. I pay rent but I also pay for water sewage electricity natural gas internet tenant insurance water heater contract furnace filters light bulbs etc. The only things I dont pay for are property taxes and any non-consumable maintenance costs.  Not only that but my rent is increases every year. I still have to do yard work and shovel my driveway in the winter. Renting isnt always as simple as paying a fixed fee every month for the rest of your life.
hmblz8o,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,>Oh man :/  Now that you mention it.... Yes being a male will cost you more also.
hmbfgmr,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,>The structure of an LLC is determinant as to how it is taxed.   Yes the structure determines the taxation-- not the LLC.  OP will still be a sole proprietorship regardless of whether or not theyre an LLC.  >So while not directly a defined tax entity it will most definitely affect taxation.  Not really. A sole proprietorship is going to be taxed the same regardless of whether or not its an LLC.  From your IRS quote: For income tax purposes an LLC with only one member is treated as an entity disregarded as separate from its owner-- i.e. its treated as a sole-proprietorship. Its treatment only changes if it elects to be treated as a Corp. Its not the LLC that causes the tax treatment to change.
hmbnaah,zhonzhon,11/27/2021,1,FICO is the one typically used.  and there are three credit agencies that report FICO (transuniuon experian and equifax).  even your fico score will vary between the three agencies.   typically the highest score from the three agencies is used.
hmd2fjv,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,I would checkout this list https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/mortgages/heloc-lenders and see the requirements the lenders ask for.
hmangzc,Nova_Nightmare,11/27/2021,1,I dont know what kind of job you do but there are plenty of job openings around perhaps you can pick up another job somewhere else maybe find one that doesnt require you to lift much or will accommodate your light duty needs in order to have a good full time employee when you are done with it.  Another option maybe Uber or Lyft to make up the difference while recovering no heavy lifting needed. Maybe one of those delivery food services but Im not sure how much heavy lifting those would be.
hm8ykb3,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,1,We will cash out on the rental when we move to TX to SC. The cost of living is cheaper there.   I see what you’re saying. After contributing to our retirement accounts I have about $4800 (sometimes more with quarterly  bonuses) a month to put towards savings and investments.   I calculate even if I contribute 3k a month to my Vangaurd brokerage account starting with the current point I’m at (50k) in 10 years I’ll be at 660k. This is with an 8% return because I plan for the worst. The equity and cash flow from the homes in Austin for however long we keep them.  I’d be stoked to leave TX with $300k from equity in our properties. Just maybe getting greedy looking to upgrade to a DT more expensive property it sounds like….  Why is what I was afraid of. A loan on a rental more than your primary residence even after putting 20% down is a little unsettling.
hmczgis,doebogan,11/27/2021,1,Yes I’ve made up my mind! Gonna do it. Difficult to think rationally when I’ve been frugal my entire life :). Thank you for sharing your experience!
hmbd11x,lainey822,11/27/2021,1,Lets not forget that you chose to have kids and not want to share a house with people to lower your cost. In order to build wealth you need to live on less than you earn buy what you can afford and sacrifice to make it work. I understand the market very well.  I didnt make up this concept of 3x.  This is a well known rule in the financial literacy space.  Just because you are struggling and extending beyond your means doesnt mean you have to drag me down with you lol.
hmcqxd5,Scarface74,11/27/2021,1,I got divorced at 32 after four years. I bought her out of the equity of the house. I did a QDRO and gave her her part of my 401K and I moved on and start rebuilding my financing with my decent income at the time. But has more than tripled since then.
hmcshwh,OntarioHookah,11/27/2021,1,This is most likely the most logical explanation! But yeah I ended up just keeping the card since the hard inquiry was already done.
hmc9ahb,Grenachejw,11/27/2021,1,If youre both contributing financially cheaper rent or mortgage cheaper car insurance cheaper grocery bills
hmd0qvh,Prettybarbie2,11/27/2021,1,I wouldn’t.  It’s scamming season people will try to get you anyway they can.  There’s some honest people in the world but there’s also lots of bad people.   You don’t want the check to bounce so  I would accept cash only or another form of payment.    I would never buy a car without seeing it in person and without bringing a mechanic with me to make sure I’m not getting a lemon.  Also if I’m not buying from a dealer I also don’t like to pay cash just incase something is wrong with the car that you did NOT tell me about so I like to use my credit card for big purchases..
hmalh7o,shotthebird,11/27/2021,1,Id recommend putting it in a land trust. Just Google the area of the state you live in and add land trust to it and that will get you dtarted. It also looks like you can donate land to the DNR in your state! One last option would be depending on the condition of the wetland you say its on but you could sell it to a wetland bank. This would be the most profitable for you but again depends on a few factors.
hm9jy33,ljaffe19,11/27/2021,1,Thank you this is something to consider. Another thing I didn’t mention is that I have kids with stuff to lug around for them and having more cargo space is also important to me. The Camry is a nice sedan but I don’t feel that it’s currently meeting my needs right now
hmabg75,not-now-im-redditing,11/27/2021,1,I haven’t looked at all of the comments so if this has been addressed then please forgive me. What does her debt situation look like? The investing advice so far sounds solid but if she’s buried in credit card bills those need to be paid off to free up her cash flow. Retirement funds should be based on her expenses. Reduce her expenses and you reduce the amount of money she needs.
hmda67x,desquibnt,11/27/2021,1,> So I guess that just leaves google for finding a lender?  Google is fine. Talk to your bank is also fine. I like to look at my citys chamber of commerce website to find local companies. There are local brokers everywhere.   > Also how do I get preapproved if I don’t know how much the house will cost?  You get pre-approved for an amount and then look at houses in that price range. You can chance a pre-approval amount to go higher or lower depending on the houses youre looking at.
hmd2yyt,chippypoo,11/27/2021,1,And you clearly have no idea how mortgages work if you think a mortgage responsibility doesn’t show up as cash out in someone’s account when an underwriter sits to evaluate a persons worthiness for a mortgage loan. It’s all part of FNMA guidelines.

hmbzopy,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,> Firstly why is Honda so desperate for my car?  Well Honda the car company couldn’t care less. This is a dealer that’s reaching out to you.   It’s a sales pitch. They’re not desperate for anything. They’d be sending you the letter if you drove a Geo Metro that had to be pushed into the dealership. They want to sell you a new car simple as that.
hmaos56,terpischore761,11/27/2021,1,Unfortunately the reporting for ESG goals has not been standardized. So different companies report on different metrics depending on what makes them look good.   It’s a vanity metric.

hmawvrc,Blah12821,11/27/2021,1,You need to work more and make more money. You need your vehicle to work. In this market you aren’t going to find a replacement vehicle for 3k.   Also your idea to buy a motorcycle bc of the better gas mileage is a poor and unsafe decision. If you don’t have experience and haven’t taken a motorcycle rider safety course then it’s a poor idea.   Keep the vehicle you have and work more hours.
hmd75jb,TheRankingsSlave,11/27/2021,1,He got it through foreclosure. All junior mortgages would have been extinguished at judgment. Title insurance would still be valuable but this is one of the few situations where it might not matter much.
hm9v94k,AmIRadBadOrJustSad,11/27/2021,1,Be worried when you need it in the next three years.  Aside from that try to retrain your thinking. The cost going down means youre getting your current contributions at a *discount* from what you would have paid. Index funds are great because they reflect a much more diversified approach than individual stock picks.  If you started buying at $100 and now it costs $50 unless you genuinely believe that the global economy is melting down forever then that $100 is going to come back eventually. And in the interim youre buying 2:1 with your money.  Im so much calmer with index accounts than investing in individual companies or crypto where you never know if youre getting out too early or too late.

hm8vyy9,Tony_M13,11/27/2021,1,I dont but they are still common. The worst is that when you want to rent an appartment in a big rental complex in my area they only accept money orders for the first payment (so you have to go to grocery store or a place like western union and give them cash (or debit card) and they will give you a piece of paper that works like a check but less secure. And those have low limits so you need 2 or 3 of them for that payment and they charge you a small amount for each of them.

hmbbnkz,jayhawk23ball,11/27/2021,1,Lot of people here talking about donating it to a land trust etc.etc. Im an attorney and trust officer/administrator for a corporate fiduciary. You really cant just donate the land unless the terms of the trust allow for you to. Typically you can either distribute out the land to the beneficiaries it stays in trust or you sell it. These things will require an appraisal if not already done.  It sounds like its going to be a pain and probably going to cost more than the land is worth but you really need to retain Wisconsin counsel and have them advise you as to what is allowable under the terms of the governing document.

They expect you to do well or they fire you.
hmcuhwu,mcarneybsa,11/27/2021,1,Except it was a diagnostic test based on a perceived issue. Preventive care is very limited to a small set of codes that primarily focus around your regular checkups and standard labs. If that lab comes back weird and you do anything else that is no longer preventive that is reactive. The bad thing already happened.   Yes it does suck that healthcare costs so much in the US and that people have to lay out the butt for diagnostics and treatments.

hm9u18f,woollywhelk,11/27/2021,1,Thinking about taxes in retirement today for some reason just curious. So with a traditional 401k the disbursement amount is fully taxable since the contributions themselves were tax deferred. For after-tax investment accounts (not Roth) only the earnings (not contributions) are taxable. Are those shares sold in a certain order like FIFO by default or how does that work?
hmc8l69,whd5015,11/27/2021,1,My GF pays me half the mortgage payment while Im responsible for the other half taxes and homeowners insurance. I found this to be a happy medium.  We cohabitated in an apartment before I purchased the home so we were already comfortable splitting expenses.
hmcyx8q,erotictravel,11/27/2021,1,OP does not say it is in a retirement account
hmd3hmo,FutureBarrySeal,11/27/2021,1,Yes. If you’re actually going and depending on what all the gym Provides. It seems like planet fitness is doing $10/month to 1 location or $20/nation wide membership. Or just shop around…. That way you can save a tiny little bit. Just ignore the creeps. Though I’d assume at planet fitness there will be less people trying to talk to you.   Maybe for you you could try just putting away an X amount for savings per month and the rest is all free money to do w/e you want. So if you’re happy putting away $300 or $500 then put that away and spend the rest on w/e else. If you have left over at the end of the month then great! More to savings.
hmd1ghl,browser1994,11/27/2021,1,When I look on Chases website for information on the hardship program it seems like they will only let you defer 1 payment? Not lower any APR or anything else just defer 1 payment. Is that all they will do?  &#x200B  https://www.chase.com/digital/resources/coronavirus/credit-card-relief-programs
hmcvn9p,UpperMaintenance5108,11/27/2021,1,You don’t need perfect credit or even 800+. Anything in the “excellent” range (I think it’s 761+) will serve you fantastically. Just only buy things you can pay off in full every month and pay your bill on time and you’ll be set.
hmcvq92,icedteacapital,11/27/2021,1,You may want to dollar cost average into the S&P500 (largest 500 companies in USA: many etfs and index funds track this metric.) Also if you want to own some  cryptocurrency that’s completely okay. However it should NOT be 100% of your portfolio. Cryptocurrency should be a maximum of 5-10 % of your portfolio. It is inherently speculative and risky yet does have some upside and may stay around for a while. I know that many companies and hedge funds are buying Bitcoin and Ethereum. Both of these options are completely free. Fidelity has many low cost index funds and even a completely free index fund for total stock market (FZROX.) Individual stock picks can play a role in your portfolio but you should know that should be after diversifying into low cost index funds paying down high interest debt etc. I hope this helped!
hmcj56z,Phat_with_an_F,11/27/2021,1,Short answer? No.  Longer answer? I dont see a bank giving someone making 83k a 500-600k mortgage especially with only 30k down credit card debt and no savings. I get you have investments but thats a bit much of a mortgage payment compared to your salary.  Id look at something that costs much less and save as much as you can for a down payment.
hmd8hku,WeeniePops,11/27/2021,1,I only plan to spend about half the money on real estate. The other half I plan to have on hand and/or put into dividend stocks. I would like to get passive income and the return on my down payments would certainly be much higher than an index fund returning 7% a year.
hmc7oag,twicethetoots,11/27/2021,1,Your boss seems nice but hes just setting the situation up so he doesnt get screwed. In the long run I bet you dont even feel a difference in pay at 47k and this new opportunity sounds more up your alley. Id take it if it meant improved happiness. Start ups blow imo and I steer clear of them. Start up is code for expect minimal pay and multiple roles dumped on you at a moments notice. Ive been at 2 start ups and they always screw you and take advantage of you because all youre there to do is make their dream work not your own.

hmd51bg,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,1,Assuming youre in the US...  You cant compare a savings account (standard or high-yield) to an IRA as they are meant to serve two entirely different purposes. An IRA is a tax-advantaged account which is meant to be used in retirement where a savings account is not a tax-advantaged account meant to be liquid funds that are accessible at any time.  If the money being invested is for retirement a tax-advantaged account (IRA 401K 403B 457 etc.) is the best place to store the funds for compounding. If the money is meant for short-term use (e.g. house down payment vacation emergency fund etc.) a FDIC-insured savings account is going to be the best place. There are other things like treasury-backed bonds (e.g. Series-I or Series-EE) that could be worthwhile investments for either retirement or savings but that opens up another can of worms.

hm8yoln,Physical_Dimension,11/27/2021,-3,How did you know recognize that it’s your teller?
hmcqhlo,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,1,If you want to be sure your money will be there in a year yes. You wouldnt be able to cash out I-Series bonds until theyve been held for a year so you would need to make sure that you purchase them soon if you were planning to go this route.  Short-term CDs may be an option as well but a lot of times they are not competitive with HYSA rates.  Another option might be opening checking accounts for bonuses but they often will tie up your money for a period of time so youd need to be mindful of that as well. Other things to consider would be if you need to keep the account open after the bonus maintaining a particular balance amount to avoid fees etc. I did a bonus offer with Citi that offered $200 with a $5000 deposit (4% ROI) it took about 4.5 months locking up that investment for to get the $5200 into my standard accounts.
hmba9j3,thememeconnoisseurig,11/27/2021,1,Appreciate the insight thanks. I didnt think about the different types of accounts. I have one closed SELF loan for credit building too from over a year ago.   I have mainly been just trying not to make my profile super suspicious by opening multiple cards at once.
hm90sjg,cmoclk,11/27/2021,1,TX lender here.  Tell the lender what you want to do your expectations goals and fears. A good lender will want to do the new purchase as well so find someone you can talk to who will walk you through the whole process and develop the overall situation for you so you can go over your options and make an informed decision.  If you dont have a lender ask around for a trusted referral or take your chances on a marketing website like LendingTree (you will immediately receive about 30 calls so be prepared) and shop multiple lenders. Its always good to do due diligence and make sure youre getting a good deal by starting with a few different lenders. There is a grace period on your credit for mortgages so having multiple checks will not harm your credit scores beyond the first one.  If you can get qualified for the loan youre probably fine since the current underwriting system is very conservative and pretty much aims at worst case.  Also talk to a realtor about properties youd be interested in. Find a neighborhood or area that you can receive good rental income vs the new mortgage cost and make sure that its a good idea to even make the purchase.
hmd5xyt,DarklightNS,11/27/2021,1,Interesting i didnt think of that.
hmadpbn,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,> would put us at 75k    Yeah youre comfortably in the 12% bracket for married filing jointly (for 2022 the bracket is $20550 to $83550). So every dollar you contribute now will have a potential 12% tax now whereas in retirement youll have a hefty $46450 of taxable income being taxed *less* than 12% so deferring at least enough that you can fill those lower brackets with tax-deferred money would be better than all-in for Roth.    Again this could all change with a large tax change but so could the rules for Roth before you get close enough to use it (without penalty).
hmcv6h5,helixflush,11/27/2021,1,I do this for big ticket purchases. Pre-pay $5000 if the item is $5000. The way I did it is transferred money from my debit account onto my credit card (both accounts show up in my online banking). No fuss
hmcy40c,ericdavis1240214,11/27/2021,1,Another consideration is the transaction costs associated with buying and selling houses. If the less expensive house is one you are very likely to grow out of at some point and the more expensive house seems like one you could stay in for quite a bit longer even as your circumstances change it may be less expensive in the long run to buy the better house now and keep it rather than buy a less expensive house pay a realtor to sell it and pay closing costs on a new house in the future.  I am all for avoiding lifestyle creep for any number of reasons including making it possible to retire someday. But strategic investments early on can help in the long run.

Its a very routine form for $10k+ cash deposits/withdrawals.  > Can I withdraw however much money that I have in my account no questions asked?  No you cant. Other than the mandatory reporting your bank also has some sort of duty to protect you and itself. What if you are a victim of a fraud scam or coercion? What if you are an unwitting money mule? Other banks have been sued for not doing enough to protect customers. Bank employees are trained to watch for signs of distress and suspicious behavior for everyones sake.

hmc97b2,j-christopher,11/27/2021,1,I dont know how the Amazon card works for these special offers but most major credit cards with 0% APR offers will show the entire purchase in a single transaction but not apply the regular APR to the portion thats been interest-deferred.  It doesnt make any difference in the ultimate cost either way.

hmbmo9p,quelindolio,11/27/2021,1,Are you male or female? Rates typically go down sooner for young women than they do for young men. My husband’s car insurance rate didn’t drop until he was 25. Mine went down when I turned 21. However my stepmother lied to me for a year and said it was still over $200 a month. If you are 23 and female I’d definitely look into getting your own insurance. It shouldn’t be that high with a good driving record.

hmceprc,Ameteur_Professional,11/27/2021,1,You dont fall into 1 bracket though.  The situation you described where 2 partners have disparate incomes is usually the most beneficial case for taxes after marriage because more of the higher earners income falls into lower brackets.  Tax brackets in the US are marginal.
hmd130v,Realistic_Honey7081,11/27/2021,1,Cool soooo.   Shop around for a mortgage locally check out local credit unions.   After a lot of hunting for perfect ears and calling like 50 places I found one in my area that offered exactly what I wanted for how much and at what rate.  Now. Do you qualify for a mortgage? Do you have income that a loan company would consider for your repayment ability? For example when I was in college I received a stipend from the VA for the GI bill of $1300 a month. This in addition to my part time job allowed me to sit pretty comfy. Back in 2015ish I attempted to use these income streams to buy a home. At the end of the day and a lot of stress my income wasn’t considered valid for the purposes of doing a home loan it would have been fine had I had a co-signer but I was not blessed with such a network.  So that’s firstly. Secondly.  You can have multiple home loans. You don’t refinance when you buy a new one. Each loan is with a different company. Some loan products are backed by the federal government removing risk for the lender if you default. These loan types have a certain cap on how much you can have in total for an outstanding balance and still be able to qualify for the more financially beneficial product.   Generally your plan is golden. When you move you can sell it. Rent it. Or leverage it and rent it.   Selling it or leveraging it can help bank roll your next home. But your a long way away from the decision so it doesn’t matter.  Hit up a bank that’s open tomorrow and ask about home loans. A loan salesman would be happy to talk to you because they make commission.
hmaougw,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,But isnt the beauty of a Roth is that all *earnings* are tax deferred too.  In other words I may have been paying 12% tax on what we current put in but would that equate to the same amount of taxes paid if that money grows at 12% or greater?  I hope that makes sense.  I am new to personal finance.  We do well enough and are frugal as we can be but Im trying to prepare for down the road.  Thank you for all your help!

I’m in favor of getting the match and cutting your expenses by the same amount.  If you haven’t done it yet - track your spending to the penny for 3 months. This will open your eyes to your true spending patterns. Having to be honest with yourself about your spending will really help you budget reflexively when you are out and about.

hmaw8m3,benj_frito,11/27/2021,1,Have been recommended that by others aswell as of right now I just want both of us to understand the importance and come up with a basic-ish plan. Will definitely look into it further.
hmb0bzh,One-Kind-Word,11/27/2021,1,You were so thorough and helpful. Thank you.
hmaxmgo,spanctimony,11/27/2021,1,You have zero leverage I’m afraid.  Your choices are to renew at $1196 or move. You may not need to give 60 days notice….they can’t just declare that. It’s governed by your existing lease agreement.
hmcywp0,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,The 3 major credit bureaus are still offering free weekly online credit reports I would go to https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action and get your 3 reports and dispute what you need to.
hm9pfmv,raika11182,11/27/2021,1,Make sure your retirement is invested in an appropriately aggressive fund for your age. You have time to ride the highs and lows.  With a loan from an IRA youre not usually taxed but if you stop paying it back the remainder of the loan will count as a distribution and youll be taxed 10% for early withdrawal I believe. However this might be different with Roth IRAs and I dont have a lot of experience with them. Hopefully someone else can chime in for that question.
hmcopva,SubaWho1337,11/27/2021,1,in addition to the 8.1% APR - to offer me the loan basically. Well 14.99% over the course of 22 months on a 24k current balance reducing by $1200 a month (assuming minimum) I think about $4500 in interest over 2 years. I think...if I did my math right.
hm94kxj,YeahIGotNuthin,11/27/2021,2,1. By February 1 they will send you a w2 or a 1099 (assuming you are in the US) showing how much you earned from them.   B. Why would you not want to go over $54k? For one thing I don’t think that’s a US tax bracket where anything changes. For another thing you know that earning enough to put you “into the next tax bracket” doesn’t mean everything that year gets taxed at that higher rate right? There’s no situation where earning another dollar means you take home LESS than you would without that dollar. It just means that dollar and the ones after that this year get taxed at the higher rate.
hmc8qcl,Salty_Peak8156,11/27/2021,1,Its capital one. Are you saying I should close out this credit card and get the no annual fee card?
hmcvehl,Barbossal,11/27/2021,1,Are you talking about a Wedding or Marriage in general? Weddings are incredibly overpriced whereas being Married is a huge asset when it comes to shared assets.
hm9u320,ASHAKANTASHARMA,11/27/2021,1,I cant help you in any way but just wanted to wish Gods blessings for you 🙏🙏🙏
hmayj4s,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,You should simply do the taxes both ways and compare. Certain software helps do this quickly.  I dont think Ive ever seen a real life situation where filing separate was better. Ive seen people do it (eg divorces) but only the IRS wins.
hmbnfp3,Ok_Salary5884,11/27/2021,1,I only suppose they took pictures of my social. Due to them knowing the last 4 of my social security numbers.
hmbe2u8,ecmcn,11/27/2021,1,Nature Conservancy is a great organization. They’re at least worth talking to about the options.
hmcvy3b,Environmental_Put_33,11/27/2021,1,At that income level the 30-35% rule for monthly rent/mortgage is a lot more relaxed really. Due to the numbers being this large you can easily swing this. You still didnt even hit your prime earning years.......
hmcu1u4,ack154,11/27/2021,1,Only thing I can think is to buy something with the card pay the credit card balance then return the item to get the refund back on the card. Though to do this intentionally would probably be some sort of fraud.  Having said that - if something is too expensive for your credit card... just dont put it on that credit card. Or call and ask if theyll increase your limit.
hmawwl3,Nofrillsoculus,11/27/2021,1,Yeah if youre going to donate it this is the way. Find the people it was stolen from originally.
hmcwi2o,happy-cig,11/27/2021,1,Yah in that case Id recommend you go to www.creditkarma.com as others have suggested.   Been using them for years just decline their offers for new credit cards loans etc.
hmd1ysj,Key-Emu5781,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for this response appreciate your explanation and kind response.   And I was told EKG was a normal thing they do for annual checkup - it was covered by insurance regardless. After results they just rolled in the echo and did it immediately
hmcg6vd,Wunderkinds,11/27/2021,1,Yes this is why I gave five percent of my salary to spend on myself without guilt. I literally have a debit card that has a custom image that says Guilt Free Spending. It automatically gets put in the account.  So I usually spend it on steaks and ammo.
hmcto80,ChronoMonkeyX,11/27/2021,1,They werent sent by mistake they wanted to see if it would slip past you.
hmcuxt2,Benz_300,11/27/2021,1,There’s been times I pay my balance in full & it clears the same day as I have a reoccurring payment scheduled they’ll both go through & it puts my account in the negative.
hmc8dmo,moneypenny88,11/27/2021,1,Yes paying interest isn’t a good idea ever.   You can do this method to maximize scores without paying interest. I do it with my subscriptions Netflix etc and pay in full monthly no interest ever.   It won’t matter with scores as high as yours but it could with the op if his scores are 750 paying it to zero could hurt.  It’s just an fyi.  I’m 2 years post bankruptcy and had to rebuild. I’m doing a mortgage now. So I researched a ton to get my score to the max possible so I’d qualify.
hmczmo1,flautist96,11/27/2021,1,Might be a dumb question but does your University not have a gym for students. Im pretty sure most do at least in the U.S.
hmbee8x,Duffmanlager,11/27/2021,1,Agreed. Just need to pay attention to the useful life what you’re buying. How old is the roof the ac/heater kitchen appliances etc.  You may think you’re getting a deal but with the way homes are selling some people could be unloading before they are hit with massive improvement costs. Need to look at that closely.
hmafhwn,linuxtrek,11/27/2021,1,Dont do the RSA SecurID Device. I just did it and there are some transactions like forwarding a new card to your Canada address that requires the OTP from SMS. I am still stuck :(
hmb3qs8,Earthquake14,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the perspective. Unfortunately anything lower than 200k in our area is either really tiny in a really bad neighborhood or will require a ton of work all of which are dealbreakers for us.
hmd4dza,letuswatchtvinpeace,11/27/2021,1,Best sofa I ever bought was $140 at an estate sale.      Buy my recliners at them as well they dont hold up to my 85lb dog jumping and leaning on them so I just pay $50 every 6 months for a new recliner.
hmcxyaf,ZoraksGirlfriend,11/27/2021,1,If you’ve been out of work for months and are on the last of your savings though? People get desperate and that leads them to do things they would otherwise be too cautious to do.
hmb7hbf,mymomswedding,11/27/2021,1,Exactly the driving is needed for the wedding activities- I could look into uber but I don’t think they have it.  Edit: they do have it I’m a dumb dumb
hmdax1r,inkseep1,11/27/2021,1,Generally gas cannot be shut off in the winter if the temperature is forecast to fall below a certain temperature within 24 hours.  Here it is 38 F but it will vary from state to state.    Depending on where you live there can still be plenty of cut off days.  The inside meter readings might just be estimates generated by the computer billing system.     Or the inside meter readings might be self reads where the customer reads their own meter and sends it in.  If that is the case then the prior owner might have been purposely under reading it to have lower bills.  We used to have that here but we switched to all remote read meters and it solved a lot of these problems.    It should not take months to figure it out.   This is something that can be computed in something like 10 minutes manually.
hmb0jr6,kdavis37,11/27/2021,1,You have a portfolio of the sorts of things you enjoy shooting? Also if youre more comfortable at can kick over to PMs. I have no idea how to deal with wire scams but know a lot of folks across the country so maybe we can find someone looking for a photographer.
hmawp3g,boredprogrammerguy,11/27/2021,1,My wife and I got married at 23/22 almost immediately out of college. Wedding was under $5k most of which we got back in practical gifts for our new apartment together. Engagement ring was only $1400 wedding bands were under $500 each. and honestly looking back we should have done non traditional rings and saved a couple thousand but hey at least it wasn’t a $10000 ring budget I guess.  Your sister has some weird ideas about marriage. I agree that you should not marry someone for financial reasons but working together to pay bills isn’t exclusive to marriage. Just make sure once you’re married all of your financial goals are in alignment. It’s no longer “your” and “my” money but “our” money.
hmavts7,ooglieguy0211,11/27/2021,1,Okay so Im glad people are trying to help you out here by telling you not to leave it at the tow yard. I can give you some information as to why you should leave it there. I know people assume that tow yards are a scam I can assure you that they are not most anyways.  As a former towman for over 10 years I can offer this advice. By leaving the car at the tow yard the insurance company will be more inclined to get to your claim more quickly. If its sitting at your house or some other place where its not gaining storage fees they dont see an immediate need to get to it. At a tow yard the insurance company has access to it if they need any more info instead of having to schedule with you to meet them (this applies more to accidents that require investigarions). If they choose to send out an adjuster to the vehicle to see assess it to know if its totalled or just needing repair they can get to it easier. If they just want to repair it its in a place thats easy for them to get to it to have that done with minimal hassle to your day to day life.  I get it you dont want to pay more fees. It depends on how the accident is handled as to what you would be responsible for. That $12 fee is usually handled by the insurance company when they do the assessment and often given to you if you request it. It also depends on whether or not you live in a no fault state or not. The insurance companies are often tasked with assigning or building a case to assign fault when the officers on scene arent allowed to.   All of that being said you do whatever you feel that you should do. If you choose to leave the vehicle at the tow yard to help speed the process up make sure you call the tow yard and make time to go down and get your belongings from the vehicle.
hmc1z40,VictorChristian,11/27/2021,1,LOL! Was it for Chase Private Client?  I got the same pitch. They set up a meeting with me with two of their bankers who really pushed the whole lifestyle enhancement - I can get replacement ATM cards in a day even when vacationing in Santorini!  The whole 1% fee is just nuts. They wont do anything you cant do yourself. I yanked my money out of there and dumped it into Schwab and divvied it up among SPY (SP500 ETF) and some other high (>3%) dividend yield stocks. Its working out just fine.  In fact Fridays mega dip afforded an opportunity to pick up even more SPY on a slight discount.
hmb477z,lippoper,11/27/2021,1,There are other platforms like Coinbase Voyager Kraken etc… offering insane APRs on stable coins as well.
hmc5ubj,Dopeshow4,11/27/2021,1,Yes this is correct. Tough situation but is spending a few thousand more worth a hard talk with the mom? Thats the question and only you can answer it.
hmbcpfk,LLR1960,11/27/2021,1,I disagree on not taking the GF into consideration.  It sounds like shes a fiancee and as such kids might be in the picture as well as hopefully living together for a lot of years.  Dont buy huge but account for more people than just one living in your potential property.
hmcrmve,seriouslyjan,11/27/2021,1,Exactly he is selling you a product that is in his best interest.  He/She will get paid a portion of your payment as commission for the sale.  Dont do this.
hmcsxf5,Ainulindala,11/27/2021,1,Do any of these apply to you? https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/savings/savings-accounts/  Are you looking to leave boa permanently?
hmbxu9m,j-christopher,11/27/2021,1,Did you apply for the account online?  Do you have your credit bureaus and/or Chex and/or similar consumer reporting agency files locked?  Ive been declined for credit cards for the same reason and its usually fixed with a phone call.  Even if they kept the account open deposits from new customers gnenerally have extended hold times so you should open a new account and/or otherwise deposit only funds you wont need for a couple of weeks at least.  The proximity of your bills being due and you kids birthday have nothing to do with Bank of America.
hmach69,Annabel398,11/27/2021,1,Glad to hear it.  (“Armpit state” heehee. When I read that I heard in my head an old friend from way way back telling me that he came from “Buffalo New York da ahhhmpit of da East”…)
hmannsb,Pemi1099,11/27/2021,1,Thats why Im saying to split toward the person keeping equity paying more. If the person renting is getting a good deal then if you break up they had a cheap place to rent.   Ideally the intent is they stay together and at that point just make the ownership joint.if a power dynamic is created because of this then the relationship probably shouldnt continue anyway.
hma6ax7,_c4rli3,11/27/2021,1,Provider A told me they only did rollovers via check they wouldn’t give me the option for direct deposit. They said the check would be addressed to Provider B but they wouldn’t mail it directly to them they had to mail it to me or my company. I had it mailed to me and then went through HR because I’ve never rolled over a 401k before and needed guidance on how to go about doing it. I feel like even if I was the one to mail the forms and check directly from my home they still would’ve had trouble… they seem extremely disorganized and it’s really frustrating.
hm9tv5p,tyclune121,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the info. I don’t get why they make this so difficult just take my money government!
hmcb48r,stealthybutthole,11/27/2021,1,The comment you’re replying to is insanity lol. Don’t even worry about his opinion
hmcs4if,NaesPa,11/27/2021,1,Upon signing contract for you previous position included were job tasks and duties if you are no longer fulfilling those duties you are in breach of contract and you absolutely can be sued for the excess in pay.
hma3ytm,Bspy10700,11/27/2021,1,See the thing is I’ve never had any issues with credit cards ever I’ve never carried a balance on them ever and had $20000 in credit by the age of 19 somehow and then I pulled a couple grand out at the bank before I left to travel to have cash on hand when I landed to exchange an pay for things easily but while I was at the teller I asked to pay of my card balance of $70 and leave $100 in my savings just in case I needed cab fare or something when I came back to the states to get back home we’ll turns out the teller never paid off the card and so my monthly payments to the card was taken from my savings account anyway I tried to dispute it and it was passed on because it was past 90 days   When I travelled next I couldn’t find a job anywhere which was frustrating living in another country not able to get a job I’d drop off resumes for hours each day revisit the following couple of days I’d take the train out of the city and try smaller suburbs but the issue I had was nobody wanted to higher only under the table so I worked so many under the table jobs I can’t even remember and it would be like passing fliers out for companies washing cars or doing dishes to name a few but at the end of the week I’d only make out with $170 usd after the exchange rate which covered mostly rent and I would eat pasta and or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for pretty much the whole year while saving money up for a plane ticket then once I had to pay rent early on in my trip so I used a credit card because I saw no work but had a call back for a job the day before and went to the interview they said you’re the perfect candidate for our second interview with the main hiring manager in a couple days when they fly back in (I got screened by the assistant manager) but I don’t know what happened I never got a callback and once I showed up a day after a couple days all I was told was the position was filled… so throughout the year I was lucky to save around $20 a week and lived off of $1-5 (my plane ticket back to the states cost $570) But because that stupid interview that card got canceled and went to collections.   Anyway now after being back in the states I rebuilt my credit never carrying a balance on a credit rebuilding card for a year with only access to $300 now that was ridiculous so I just had it set up for automatic payments for my phone bill and that was it never used it for anything else as my bill was only like $70 and under 30% of my usage in doing that I went from a 560 to a 700 by the end of the year so I got another card because I was tired of not being able to make money back when I spend like how I used to be able to so got a cash back card and then once I got married covid hit and my wife was a certified nursing assistant and the news rules put into place made work near impossible in the area we lived so she tried finding something else she would enjoy and hopped between 3 jobs within 4 months and I think saw a total of 3 months not working and 6 jobs overall within the whole year I worked 2 jobs and went to school full time but she was really depressed as well and began a spending frenzy so I had to start paying on her cards and she felt bad so she sold things I bought her like a Michael kors pusre timberland boots etc and she even sold her car all the while i was paying all the bills and rent majority of the year but now she’s back to doing what she loves and helping me pay my cards off   I good with credit in my opinion just have had really bad luck but have never missed a payment since my traveling days and am on my way to working back to a better score but I asked about this card because it offers a nice percentage back on categories for when I’d use it in the future but I’d use the intro offer to transfer my balance to it on my highest interest card of $1100 and then pay my two cards off within the next two weeks and then pay off the “new card” by the end of January
hmcexu7,Wunderkinds,11/27/2021,1,What does your dad say? I recommend never listening to single women about much of anything because single women have a tendency to keep women single.  If you dont have a dad what is he studying?  What is his job?  How much does he make?   For my daughter I would recommend someone that is older and that is making over 100k but if he is close and plans on making plenty of money then I wouldnt mind oking an ikea marriage.  But your sister is one hundred percent wrong. Unless you are going to make over 90k (depending on your area) you will need to rely on a man (you will still need to rely on a man just not for retirement).  The idea that women shouldnt rely on men is bred in fantasy. Ask a man if he needs to rely on men and he will say he relies on men every day.  So ignore her. If he is studying STEM and is going into STEM go down to the court house and pay the $100 yourself and lock it down. And make sure you take care of that man like your life depended on it because one day it might.
hmcknbz,Learn_Finance,11/27/2021,1,So if you buy I Bonds before the end of April 2022 do you still get 7.12% for the following six months?
hmb8oqb,lapinatanegra,11/27/2021,1,Shoot...how much yall sell it for?
hm99zvp,vgacolor,11/27/2021,5,Assuming the following:  1) You stop working for four years to get your degree.    2) You have $15000 in expenses associated with tuition and books each of the next four years.     3) You get 2.5% raises every year in your current job and 6% raises every year in the CS job.     4) We discount every salary and expense to the present value using 2%.    You will make more money by sticking with your current job. Ten years from now the CS job salary will surpass the current job ($80.3K vs $78.7K) and by the time you retire in 23 years the difference will be significant ($171.3K vs $108.5K) but the fact that you will be giving up the next four years of compensation and start at a lower amount in year 5 is not fixable. Also we are assuming that CS salaries will continue to outpace inflation by using a 6% growth rate. That might not be the case. Then again inflation might remain high in that case throw the model away.    By the way the present value of the CS job is $1.21 Million and the present value of the current job is $1.53 Million. (Discounting the salaries). I did not look at the savings for retirement but it is clear that using up $100000 right now and not saving for the next four years will wipe out any benefit of higher salaries after year 10.

hmd9ujm,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,You dont have to actively use a credit card to get the benefits of it. A majority of the impact a credit card has is the age of the credit line and if the account was ever in negative standing. You dont have to use it much to get those benefits.  Set one or two small subscriptions up to pay from the card enable autopay and destroy or hide the card. If you are the kind of person that will run up a bill the security and points benefits of a credit card are wiped out by the credit losses.
hmd6ef3,LetsBeCoolMan,11/27/2021,1,Thank you!! My wife is from Boston and I’m from Florida. She’s stoked to be back in New England and I’m stoked to get some space from folks haha
hmd5lhk,IPlayTheInBedGame,11/27/2021,1,You probably cant qualify for the loans because your income is too low.  You MIGHT be able to get the first one but I kinda doubt it.  The bank isnt gonna care about the potential rental income of the property when determining your ability to pay off the loan.
hm9pxbo,ChaoticSquirrel,11/27/2021,1,Congrats on your PR status and credit score!
hmcql3y,LiteBulb88,11/27/2021,1,What you described is the typical process for a rollover reverse or not. It sounds complicated but Its not--really all you have to do is mail a check.
hmav2bs,Frozenlazer,11/27/2021,1,Balance transfer promo rates are often a good way to take it to very low rate for 1 or 2 years. Other option would be like a personal loan thru a credit union.
hmbokil,asparagusface,11/27/2021,1,My comment is pointing out a spelling error in the previous comment. It has since been corrected.
hmac08o,theoriginalharbinger,11/27/2021,1,Get it. Pay with a card (if they let you some dont) and *keep the receipt*.  You have a responsibility to mitigate here. Their insurance will pay the yard costs and the vehicle damage but you need to be keeping an account of what this is costing you.  Given your description - the car may be totaled may not be. Theyll want an adjuster to look at it regardless.
hmbrgki,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,Impossible to say. When I was 18 I had been an AU on a parents card for 2 years and then I opened my own card. Had like a ~670 or so.
hm9f2vl,k-tax,11/27/2021,7,Why? In my whole European life I have never had an issue with an instantly settled transaction. Why an outdated heterogenous system would be better than modern and unified system?   Credit card transactions are settled instantly and I dont see any issue here. But Ive heard that people in the US are giving their credit card details to be written down or even give them by phone so maybe there are differences here too.

hmc2229,semi-,11/27/2021,1,your situation makes me think youd have time to pay for the expense on a credit card while you await the money being pulled out of a HYSA(or reduce how much you contribute to offset paying off the card). Obviously not carrying a balance just using it to bridge a short time gap   But obviously its still about your comfort level

hmab0bo,Stable-McCafe,11/27/2021,1,As long as you and your SO will be on the same page with financial psychology. Youll be fine.
hmd6s7e,oceanleap,11/27/2021,1,Another benefit is that you both back up each other. It works in ways other than financial of course but the financial part is real. Its very common for people to go through times of financial hardship in life where they are not bringing in an income. Unemployment bad health having kids bad choices caring for sick family members forced early retirement etc. If you are married hopefully your spouse can support the family during those times and you can support the family when they hit those times. That is a major safety net.
hmbt5t2,NH3-Chief,11/27/2021,1,Well well all be surprised if your input changes my thoughts on this is 25 years. Thanks doc!
hmarb9d,rwhal06,11/27/2021,1,I updated my post above to say I REFUSE to share my Vanguard credentials with a 3rd party like Mint or Plaid or PersonalCapital I care about security.   Thats why Im interested in federated logins or read-only credentials or API keys.   The bot sent me to https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing which has a section called Why does everyone seem to recommend Vanguard? which is what I was afraid of. It sounds like there is a serious trade-off between low-fees and having decent reporting and technology.
hmckcom,Educational_Lobster6,11/27/2021,1,If you budget $700-800/month for rent you will have $500-600 left for other expenses and can supplement that with your savings until you can get yourself a better job. Get out of the bad living situation first and then focus on increasing your wages.

hmct2pp,VeseliM,11/27/2021,1,To protect you from unforeseen expense is what your out of pocket maximum is for. Expect that number plus premiums to be your potential healthcare expense every year going forward
hmcyr5x,oldcreaker,11/27/2021,1,I do it several times a year (but small amounts) - I have fixed automatic payments made from my checking account twice a month. If Ive charged an abnormally low amount on my card and forget to reduce the automatic payment I can end up with a negative balance on my card.
hmcw3rd,yellowcanvas,11/27/2021,1,>We do have a gym on campus but I find the hours and the walk inconvenient there are barely any racks available and there are a lot of creeps. I also dont like seeing my peers when Im working out.  There are a lot of creepy frat boys that Ive noticed last time I went and its just hoards of them trying to be big. Id be joining a small local gym instead if I do join it.

hmbcvpb,CQME,11/27/2021,1,This all depends upon what you think about crypto.  Theres a camp that says its the new money and will take over the world and then theres the other camp that says that its a nice brain teaser but nothing more.  People have speculated on crazy things in the past [the tulip bubble of the 1600s is case in point.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutch_tulip_bulb_market_bubble.asp)  If you believe this is going to be the new money youd probably want to hold on to your crypto.  If you think this is the latest mania to take over the market youd want to sell.

hmcjwv9,Western-Gold7915,11/27/2021,1,There is no harm asking for a codeing review from the provider office and calling your insurance to see if you can appeal.  You contest to test  you could have said no and walked out.

hmd3bdm,lenswipe,11/27/2021,1,> My question is was this just a cash grab for an extra $200?   Yes. In most states if a product is mislabeled cheaply they have to sell it to you for that price.   > Would that have gone to the company or the employee (they were def commission based)?   At least a good chunk wouldve gone to the employee probs.  >  Or is there some deeper reason like making me feel I got one over on them for paying $200 less that the “real” sticker?  Also very possible.
hmc52gn,AdventurousDoubt1115,11/27/2021,1,I candidly find it VERY hard to do. I’m not super detail oriented so don’t trust myself. But when I took that step and sometimes I do the entire exercise again to check in with myself I developed a sense of intuitive budgeting / knowing when I spent a lot or had some flex room in a way that didn’t stress me out.  And I’m so totally with you - when I kind of realized wow “I can cut back or add more spend when I want it doesn’t have to be permanent” it gave me a lot of mental freedom to experiment a bit without feeling irresponsible. I found that doing it for a whole year as a baseline was a really helpful tool to give my mind and life to actually adjust to a different way. When I tried it for only 2 months I’d get stressed and then zap back to super stringent life for like 5 months so I didn’t even get to experience the reality of an actual new budget!   :) and happy to share what has helped me. I so relate to where you are in your financial journey!  Also I’d recommend start today by buying yourself a little treat. Even if it’s like a muffin from a coffee shop before you make your 1-year-experiment-budget. Something to make that kick off activity a little fun and luxurious :)
hmcugki,The_Big_Red_Wookie,11/27/2021,1,They typically dont let you. Definitely not if youre paying online. You can sometimes do that if you mail a check. But! They may immediately refund the money back to you as a check and mail it back.  Negating what your proposing. Its simply easier to hang on to your cash and use it along with your card.
hmcpyh8,nhocks,11/27/2021,1,Does your employer have an HR system that allows you to allocate certain pay amounts/percentages to different accounts? If so whatever the increase is allocate it to another account you can’t touch (or easily access).
hmcs04e,thejumbowumbo,11/27/2021,1,I appreciate your rant. Im not fond of dealerships either. Theyre really not there to advocate for the customer theyre there to pad their bottom line which is what I suspected when they called me thanks for the confirmation!
hmbiqj9,emperorOfTheUniverse,11/27/2021,1,Yup that how real estate works.
hmd6d68,neomage2021,11/27/2021,1,Not always... some well known it/software companies that just take on a bunch of contracts hire people and train them. They make the new hires sign a contract saying they will work for said company for 2 years or have to pay back $35k.
hmd8104,xVeene,11/27/2021,1,ugh horrible. Anyways glad I kept my foot down.. No thanks I will not be taking the insurance no matter how many times you ask so lets move on please. :) Insurance is usually a shit show but from furniture stores definitely worse.
hma3w4u,DeluxeXL,11/27/2021,1,Learn what you invested. A target date fund invests in almost all kinds of public stocks and bonds on the whole planet. If it goes down and doesnt come back up ever the whole planet is fd. Russell 1000 invests in 92% of the US public stocks so you are also investing in a strong economical power. They will go up in the long run which coincides with your own time frame (401k is for retirement 30-40 years away). Short term price fluctuations are normal.  If you are talking about your 401k dropping 3% when you are 61 yea you should probably review your portfolio.
hmcobw0,thememeconnoisseurig,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the insight with sources- my plan is (prior to house hunting) I will pay off all cards and wait until it posts so my score goes back to where it would be without utilization.   I plan on getting no hard pull CLIs from my clear amex and apple card as often as I can.
hmbse6t,freeman1231,11/27/2021,1,Marriage is not expensive… living together isn’t any more expensive then living alone in fact most times it’s cheaper since you are pooling money together for something.  What can be expensive is weddings engagement rings and kids. If you don’t plan to go crazy on these items like you mentioned then no marriage is not expensive.   I’ve saved money every month since getting married since my wife doesn’t let me buy McDonald’s as often as I did before. Home cooked meals only for me.
hmd6fmp,Coug_Love,11/27/2021,1,My doctors office actually knows all the the plans it accepts. They also get preapprovals from me then the insurance before ordering anything out of the norm.   The $700 will go towards OPs deductible insurance will not pay until the deductible is met.

hmcdnzv,OneWorldMouse,11/27/2021,1,You should always keep your resume updated or at least have like a LinkedIn profile. In my case I turn down the status to not actively looking or Id get nonstop phone calls. As soon as I flip that switch it must popup on all the recruiter websites though.
hm8yxv9,Tantric989,11/27/2021,18,Thats my first thought.  There are basically three groups on Earth who know how much money I make my boss HR and my bank all of whom I expect to keep that information to themselves.
hmbo3aa,USdiaspora,11/27/2021,1,To answer your question you will pay penalty and tax on earnings in the Roth if you begin withdrawing early - contributions can be withdrawn anytime. Almost all countries where you are resident will tax the Roth withdrawals as income exceptions are countries with no income tax and those with special treaties with the US such as the UK. Unless you plan on dodging taxes. Good luck
hmavxmt,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,Perfectly acceptable. If you need to manipulate your utilization (while it is a big part of a score it isnt a lasting part: most models only care about the last reported utilization from each account) you can make extra mid-cycle payments.
hmd2ba5,Key-Emu5781,11/27/2021,1,Omg!! That’s crazy. I’m glad you’re healthy. I recently moved to US from UK and the healthcare and insurance here is incredibly confusing for me. I’m amazed at these numbers

hmc6t5y,j-christopher,11/27/2021,1,The dealer doesnt get the vehicle back the lessor does.  Many (perhaps most) dealers will accept lease returns on the lessors behalf because it gives the dealer the opportunity to put you into another new car.  My leased vehicle is kept at our home in Ohio.  I leased it from a dealer in the Washinton DC metro area.  I promise you Im not driving it to Northern Virginia when the lease is up.  its going to the closest BMW dealer to our house.
hmc0a9m,Unusual_Delivery_449,11/27/2021,1,I suggest the Military as a last option of sorts. As a current service member there is alot that comes with the life. Depression sometimes a utter lack of motivation and alot of other stuff that comes with the territory. Its not for everyone. Maybe you could pull it off basic training isnt hard and if constantly enjoy what you love it shouldnt be hard for u but other than that do what you will with this info
hmc2j85,RedNero-007,11/27/2021,1,Agreed. I update my LinkedIn regularly. I also update my resume regularly. Just makes sense.

hm9hh2o,S7EFEN,11/27/2021,1,Your counter argument would be having a better offer and leveraging that and or declining because you know you could get a better offer.  25k/4 in rsus is low af for a swe position even a new grad one. if not swe idk. might be decent pretty sure other roles get way fewer rsus.
hm8vhmr,FiestaPotato18,11/27/2021,1,Lol half of this is totally made up Teslas currently sell for higher prices used than new people are literally turning them for a profit on day one of delivery because demand is so high and the supply chain is causing orders to be so delayed.

hmb6u5n,1hotjava,11/27/2021,1,Hopefully they can sell it then.   They really should consult a CPA or tax person to make sure they do the 1031 Exchange correctly
hmca4d4,j-christopher,11/27/2021,1,I have a Capital One Quicksilver that started out as one of their subprime garbage cards with an annual fee.  I think they called the original card a Platinum.  lol  One day I just called them and asked them to switch me to a better card.  Ive done this with Chase Wells Fargo American Express Bank of America Citi and probably some others Im forgetting.  Oh yeah even shitty Discover does product changes.  Call again and talk to another rep about a product change noting that its possible that your account may not eligible if its under a year old your credit isnt great etc.
hm8zm8t,Consensual-Sex,11/27/2021,1,Also remember that once you got 750 any score higher than that isn’t treated any differently. Don’t spend extra money just to chase that 850 when it makes more financial sense to pay off a loan sooner.   A 750 isn’t that hard to get. I moved to the US and opened my first credit account November 2020. Took 3 months after that to even get a credit score. I now have a score of ~740. The only thing holding me back for the most part is that all my credit accounts are less than 2 years old.
hmb6d3c,obviousarrest,11/27/2021,1,They do not. I agree that’d been the best option.

hmc5y8u,verbimat,11/27/2021,1,Sounds like you have a pretty decent boss and workplace despite what sounds like some uncertainty on your part.  Thats some pretty decent offers you were made despite your boss likely thinking youve got a foot out the door. There are places and people that make sure to not talk to you or make a single offer of support. they instead just look for any reason to fire you with cause.
hmbh123,blondie401,11/27/2021,1,For sure! The interest rates on those mortgages are really low so if I were you I wouldn’t pay down on them until I was at the point that I wanted to retire and not have any debt. Or if you were no longer able to make a profit on the investment home.   Whatever you choose you seem to have gotten yourself to a good place so congrats on that!
hmat85i,synthebunny,11/27/2021,1,Oh that makes sense. Thanks for the thorough info!
hmctn66,intraregularity,11/27/2021,1,I have done this in the past. It’s possible but it ultimately depends on your bank / credit card company.
hmbhv7x,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,>reg 401k contributions AND also subtract HSA contributions if you have one AND anything you pay for your health insurance premium. T  It doesnt sound like OP is self-employed so wouldnt likely be able to take an adjustment for 401k contributions (would already be accounted for in W2) or Health insurance premiums (only self employed health insurance premiums are eligible).
hmd9a61,Izikiel23,11/27/2021,1,Ok that explains a lot thanks! I will check the distributions thing in my plan .
hmd6258,NVPcMan,11/27/2021,1,The only way I know of it to cash the check at the bank it was drawn on and deposit cash into your account.
hmd5v0c,brittyn,11/27/2021,1,Even if you have a credit balance you still have a credit limit too. That’s what the actual purchase would go against. The charge would likely be rejected due to the limit itself not the credit balance.
hma3a6i,tired_of_username,11/27/2021,1,Why would you want to make a 30 year commitment to buy a house together if you cant make a marriage commitment?  Someone in the relationship is living a lie.
hmadqob,Inevitable_Welcome23,11/27/2021,1,Do not buy a house with a girlfriend. She can come with you to see the houses but everything else should be in your name only. Her income is not factored into the size house you can buy. She doesn’t go to the bank with you she doesn’t get to have a final say in which house you buy and she definitely doesn’t get to move in rent free (or move in while paying something) without signing a written & notarized lease agreement of some kind (month to month with a 30 day move out clause would be best if things go south and is legally your fastest eviction option).   If you don’t do this then she will be an “at-will” tenant even if she doesn’t pay any real bills as even buying food or toilet paper counts as at-will rent and infers a 90 day move out notice with a follow up court ordered eviction (moratorium is still in place in some states so 90+ whenever the moratorium ends) which takes at least 2-4 weeks to implement in most cases. She could squat on you for 4-6 months with the dude she hypothetically cheats on you with unless you protect yourself.   This stance only changes if you legally marry her (not just get engaged or whatever). If you do that then you can buy a house together.
hmbuja4,ionlydrinkIPAs,11/27/2021,1,Rural areas are generally not going to appreciate as quickly as a suburb (which may or may not appreciate as quickly as or faster than the city -  really depends on the location). But money matters aside which location fits your lifestyle best? I personally live in a suburb of a major city and value having a grocery store restaurants the library a gym etc. within a 10 minute drive of my house. In fact my next house will likely be in a city so that I can *walk* to all of those places instead of driving. Consider your goals and lifestyle and work from there. Don’t let your MIL dictate the biggest purchase of your life.   Also a fiduciary is generally not an expert on land speculation or real estate. I would talk to a real estate agent if you want to understand how different homes in Austin and surrounding areas have historically appreciated.
hmba27n,cownan,11/27/2021,1,>Youre 50 so when do you plan on retiring?  Well I dont really have a plan my company also has a pension that I could start collecting at 55 for about $2.5k/mo if I waited another ten years itll be about $4k. Im currently in the neighborhood of $2M in my retirement account. I dont hate my job so am not really in a hurry to retire unless it would be to return to consulting and be my own boss.  My liquid investments follow the market I just dump money into VTSAX when I accumulate a bit in my checking account so its currently doing way better than 3%. Thanks for your input it does feel like just carrying the mortgages is the best option for now.
hmctfhe,GrandTheftBae,11/27/2021,1,I go to a small private gym. You build a sense of community there too Ive become friends with regulars in that we hang out together. Invited to bday parties we get dinner etc.  If $30 wont break you and you get your $30 worth each month then I say go for it. Plus youre supporting small business.
hmbudlp,HorizontalBob,11/27/2021,1,Ask them what they use.   Typically  youre seeing a FICO 8 from one of the 3 bureaus. Its possible you have a 700 FICO 8 site from a credit bureau too. You should check all 3 reports to make sure the data is correct.  The data is whats used by the algorithms to make your scores.  FICO has over 30 different scores.   Ive never seen any lender that uses Vantagescore but its a way to track changes in site without the site paying FICO.
hmd5akr,WeeniePops,11/27/2021,1,What do you mean by in a meaningful way? In my area I can buy a move in ready condo for say 85k be able to put the full 20% down payment on it and then net about $500 a month on it. I currently have enough cash to do this for 2-3 condos if I can get the loans. Considering I only make about $2500 a month an extra $1000-$1500 would be quite significant for me.
hmd9yhv,SigmaLance,11/27/2021,1,This. My ex-sister in law did time for false cashier checks and the amazing amount of time that passed from when she started doing it to when she got caught was pretty flabbergasting.

hmbb3vy,cownan,11/27/2021,1,Thats a good thought but I have a bit of an attachment to the second home. It was my grandmothers that I bought from her estate when she passed away. Its in a really nice area near my extended family. I was hoping that when I do retire I might move back there. It does have quite a bit of equity though if things went bad and I needed to sell.  Im in the neighborhood of $2M in my retirement accounts which would be supplemented by a pension at my work at about $4k/mo if I retire at 65. It seems like that would be enough plus whatever growth in those accounts between now and when I retire
hmcyyra,sab3192,11/27/2021,1,Can you apply for more credit on a secured credit? Since the limit is what I deposited. Or are you referring to another credit card? Depending on my score I would actually like to apply for another credit card just to beef up my profile.
hmcaupp,Salty_Peak8156,11/27/2021,1,Yea I think I may keep it and call to waive the annual fee until I can upgrade it
hmcevup,bigjilm123,11/27/2021,1,I would ask your new company to beat your current salary.  If they offered 47 they’ll go to 52.  The job market is amazing and they don’t likely have others behind you to take the job.
hmat7bp,Nerf_hanzo_pls,11/27/2021,1,Awesome thanks!

hma293o,tastygluecakes,11/27/2021,1,Oh so you making a stink isn’t likely going to change their policy haha.  I was asking in case it was 100 people and you might be able to influence.
hmcpb5k,Ok_Anteater_7446,11/27/2021,1,So Im not sure where you live but Ill give you my personal experience (I live in Atlanta).  You should check your lease for something that says how far in advance you should be receiving your renewal options from them. If your lease says anything about them sending your options 90 days in advance (to go along with your giving notice at least 60 days in advance) it would be good to ask them in writing to give you the full 30 days to be able to consider your options without penalty since they didnt hold up their end. This is not guaranteed to work but that can at least give you a paper trail with dates in case the short timeline becomes an issue.  Also trying to negotiate is always an option. Rental tenants can suck and its been hard times so paying on time and being a decent human being can work in your favor. If there are true comparables make sure to include that. Keep in mind that your lease ends in February which is in the middle of the semester so if youre in a college town/city this can be to your advantage.  Some companies have a minimum percentage amount they must increase during each leasing period so they may counter at that. And if they flat out say no...well you know your answer.  In my situation I live in one of the cheapest apartments in the neighborhood and successfully negotiated my rate down every time (Ive lived here over 5 years). I always make sure my new lease ends during the school year to reduce the cost difference/minimize the possibility for competition. The previous owner did a 3% minimum increase but the new owners dont seem to have a set number. Pre-covid the area was booming but they let me keep my rate. Not sure how it will go this time but things have been a bit iffy around here lately so I have high hopes.  TlDr - the worst that can happen is they say no so try to negotiate and see! Depending on your area you may have more leverage than you think.
hmc19db,quelindolio,11/27/2021,1,Hello fellow Austinite! My whole family for multiple generations all come from a very rural part of a county next to Travis. I strong discourage you from buying actual rural land in your situation.  The first reason is utilities. If you live in Austin proper you have city water Austin energy electric curbside single stream recycling high speed internet and more. When you move out to places like Burnet eastern Wilco Bastrop etc. all of that goes away. My family had septic well water no internet. We had to haul trash to the dump every two weeks in an old truck. The rest of it we burned. Even in a nicer area your are looking at dealing with a septic tank and slow internet at a minimum.   The second reason is that land is a lot of work. Most people who have rural properties get an ag exemption on their taxes. But that involves farming ranching or otherwise putting the land to productive use. This is a lot of work when you know what you are doing. It’s a nightmare if you have to learn. There are smaller hobbies products like chickens and bees that will count. Those are less work than cattle but still work. You have to mow or shred two acres regularly to deal with overgrowth. Even if you like the wild look it becomes a huge fire hazard in drought conditions.  Also wildlife. If you have pets and kids you need to get good at identifying snakes. You need to learn to protect your pets and livestock from coyotes foxes raccoons and the like. Where we lived packs of wild dogs were a big issue. People like to abandon their unwanted pets on rural properties. You often end up rescuing puppies and kittens from drainage areas on your property.   Another is lack of services. It took EMS over 30 minutes to arrive for my grandmothers heart attack. There is no food delivery. You have to go into town for everything. Your local grocery store won’t have a lot of the specialty items you have have gotten used to at an Austin H‑E‑B.   In sum don’t buy a rural property unless you know what that life is like and want to live it. If you can afford it buy a house on a larger lot just outside the city. The land towards the toll road has historically been cheaper but will likely increase in value with the gigafactory going up.
hmd9ld6,IPlayTheInBedGame,11/27/2021,1,Honestly?  If youre happy enough with your current standard of living dont have any debt and are young enough (like... less than 35).  You might just invest it into an index fund targeted for retiring when youre 65.  The gold standard for investing by the time you hit 30 is 100k (or used to be).  Assuming a doubling every 7 years 100k turns into 3.2 million over 35 years.     If you dont own a house yourself yet buying a place outright would be similar to buying and renting to others.  Youd be saving whatever the cost of renting is every month (Im guessing 600-800?) and that house would also probably increase in value over time.
hmd4r6n,Lurker117,11/27/2021,1,My doctor is aware of the cost of some of the prescriptions he writes and will tell me that if my insurance doesnt cover enough of a certain medication to call him and hell change it.  Thats about it from him on cost savings.  Theres not really an alternative to a heart echo.  The choice would have been get this or dont we recommend you do.
hm8u2p6,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,2,Good question. Right direction with the way I am thinking about real estate investments primarily and if financially now is the right time purchase a rental home valued 1.5 times the value our primary residence. All while looking for land to purchase in a different state. Should we grow our emergency fund? Is taking on a loan of that size too risky right now even with the likelihood of a tenant should we be okay with what we have and focus on our brokerage account and maxing out our 401k/403B when neither of us have a match etc.  Our goal is to hit $1M at our disposal for whatever we want without it being contingent on assets we hold like a rental home. Just our money we can pull from our brokerage checking and savings accounts. We see the equity in our home and the money we can make in Austin as a major vehicle in getting there while it’s still our home state.   Hopefully I explained that better. I am overwhelming myself a bit. Not sure if everyone else got anxious about finances within the first year of marriage. I just want to lay a super solid foundation.
hmcn8c2,YankeeDoodleDoggie,11/27/2021,1,Yes and a note to make: if you reach that max before your last paycheck you may be missing out on company match. I need to contribute 5% every paycheck in order to get all of my company match.
hmd8qx6,janeusmaximus,11/27/2021,1,100% they should have just let ‘em purchase it for tagged price even if it was mislabeled. Gotta say working at a furniture store for many years very possible it was actually mislabeled. If it was mislabeled it is possible the employee actually made less commission than they would have made. For example I made 5% commission on most sales but anything sold for less than a certain profit margin I’d make 2.5%. I would never have mentioned it to a customer but this salesperson may have been trying to save his commission still pretty tacky.
hmbnj29,RO489,11/27/2021,1,Rule of thumb is that housing (or mortgage) shouldnt be more than 3x your annual income.   Like all rules of thumb- its loose and highly dependent on other factors (car payments and student loans and cost of living are the big ones)
hmd3qtd,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,1,When dealing with stocks youre typically referring to compounding growth (vs compounding interest which is usually used when referring to bank accounts). That said the concept of compounding is the same and semantics aside...  Assuming $1000 invested annually on Jan 1 10% gain/year. This example is for simplicity.  After one year your first $1000 gains $100 = $1100. Total invested: $1000 / Total Value: $1100  After the second year your first $1000 now gains $110 = $1210. Your second $1000 gains $100 = $1100. Total invested: $2000 / Total Value: $2310  After the third year your first $1000 gains $121 = $1331. Your second $1000 gains $110 = $1210. Your third $1000 gains $100 = $1100. Total invested: $3000 / Total Value: $3641  This cycle continues.

hmbwahh,rxneutrino,11/27/2021,1,We need more info here but if under $1k is *all you have* investing is not recommended until you have an emergency fund. If you carry any high interest debt like on a credit card investing is not recommended until you pay it off.  Once you have an emergency of 6 months of living expenses in a liquid account (like a bank acct) you can consider funding a 401k or Roth IRA but those will depend on your employment status. The advice there will be to utilize index funds over the long term for growth over decades.  If youre looking to use investing to get rich in the short term then youre essentially gambling and you should know that the chance of reward is proportional to risk.

hmc0vzj,AdventurousDoubt1115,11/27/2021,1,I relate to this. I make very good money but job is in a high cost of living area and I’ve been in situations where I’ve needed emergency funds I didn’t have so I don’t trust the security of a good income to the extent that I afford myself a quality of living that I could.   What I will say though is that I’ve learned what I like to invest my splurges in vs not. For example I travel a lot for work. Getting myself a nice suitcase improved my life in a routine way - it was a one time high expense but not a one-time impact expense.   Clothing wise I buy a few nice/more expensive items of clothing that are classic that I know I’d have for years and then stock up over time on less expensive basics that are less cost and therefore more comfortable to me to replace when needed. By evaluating cost by long term expense and deciding what I find wasteful (ordering food in or getting coffee out when I can make it myself — turns out those little $5-15 expenditures in my budget actually afforded me the ability to get new clothes!! And sometimes I let myself have those things because you know what they make me happy and if I’m stressed out they help take something off my plate which helps my mental health and if I’m worried I’ve been doing it too much I skip one high cost outing with friends to balance it out in the month!) —- I found that mindset helped me balance short and long term expenditures and feel more secure in the money I do spend on my day-to-day living.  Rent wise I like to go low rent when I can because it’s easiest to save a chunk at a time. So I opted to live with roommates for over a decade so I could have a nicer home while still being frugal. Now that I’m considering higher rent and a nicer place to live I feel secure in that decision because I also know where I have room in my daily expenses to trim my budget back. And turns out by spending $200 more per month - so $2400 more per year - I felt so much safer and felt better and being less stressed was not only worth its weight in gold but over the course of 2 years substantially lowered my anxiety improved my mental stability and allowed me to cut back on coffee therapy and perform better at work!   But - the thing that helped me the most was this:  Create an excel in Google docs. Make a budget of my current expenses monthly income and savings.  Then make a list of things I need (acne care physical self care clothing toiletries) the nice to have / know would have positive impact on my life in a routine way (more budget to do activities for fun buying coffee out 1x a week a new suitcase a new coat nicer haircuts etc) and calculate those costs as line items amortized/averaged both week-over-week month-over-month and year-over-year.  Then also make budget for long term financial goals (if you don’t have them think about it) and wildest dream things (ex vacation travel 2x a year a new car a gym membership a nicer apartment - whatever these items are for you they may be different than mine!).   Highlight the must-haves/needs and then prioritize the things you know would be useful and improve quality of daily life in a routine ways. They can come from both your “needs” “nice to haves” and “wildest dreams” lists - but prioritize and budget the highlighted priorities. Let yourself have fun here. You love the idea of a vacation every year? Put it in. Don’t worry we will trim down in the next step :).   Look at your original budget add in the highlighted items. Compare the difference in savings and where you can tighten further (ex. Maybe you realize you’d like a nice apartment but can forgo a travel vacation or that you can spend $400 to restock over 1-2 years on basic clothing rather than $400 a year maybe a haircut every 3-4 months instead of every 2 etc) - figure out the trade offs and wrap your mind around the adjusted savings.  Then think about your long term goals - do you want a house one day maybe it’s a new car? If so what area and/or cost? With your new adjusted savings look at how many years it would take to reach your long term big ticket goals. Wrap your mind around that timeline. Also remember these long term savings towards longer term financial goals can also be used as an emergency fund if something happens.   Then commit to exactly 1 year where you follow the new budget and see how you feel at the end of it — how much has your quality of life improved and what expenditures improved it. What expenditures do you feel by the end of the year didn’t actually improve your life or felt unnecessary or more expensive than they needed to be. At the end of each month throughout the year log the cost for each budget item so you have an actual understanding of where your money goes. Even if you’re not detail oriented just think of this as a 1 year experiment. Remember after 12 months you can go right back to your stringent ways if you want.   But at the end of those 12 months reassess overall. Maybe there are items that weren’t on your original highlighted list that you think you really would like and ones you included that you want to take off. Either way you’ll likely find your balance between spending / investing in your daily life and your savings by this time next year.   You may learn you actually don’t mind living in a not-as-nice place but would rather have acne medication and clothes. You may decide you want all 3 or none. BUT you won’t be making those decisions out of fear but rather it will be a conscious choice that allows any spend big or small to feel worthwhile and thought through.   I find having a sense of control and feeling like I made a conscious choice in how to allocate my money made a HUGE difference.   Because then money took on a different meaning to me — it became about investing in my life through small but impactful things I used routinely AND investing in my future through savings. And neither felt like they were at the expense of the other.   It also made short term investment in myself and my quality of life actually feel long term because by giving myself a reasonable quality of life I was actually preserving my happiness reducing stress levels improving my health and well being fueling myself to perform better at my job which made me money in the first place and all of which are all really important aspects of wholistic long term planning.  Allll of that said I think frugality is important none the less. People tend to live especially in high cost cities at the top of their budget. Very few friends my age have any savings but have had gorgeous solo apartments for 10 years and spend a lot on clothing and eating out. As a personal choice that is just not how I want to live or plan for my future but the above exercise really really helped me find the balance between fear-based living and deprivation which brings it’s own stress with it or feeling like I risked spending without control over my long term finances if I did anything nice for myself at all. It moved me out of an all or nothing mind set into a place that feels comfortable to me. I still keep an overall low cost of living for the city I’m in for my income and compared to my peers —- but I FEEL better and my daily life FEELS better and I FEEL better about my financial future and am cultivating a future-version of me in a way that I have cared for myself and well-being to the extent I will enjoy that future security and so I actually feel secure now too.  EDIT: my other piece of advice is WHEN you budget pad the items big time. Add an extra 10%- 20% to every cost you put in there. Then you make your trade offs and very likely by the end of the calendar year that 10% adds up to some surprise savings for an emergency fund or if it is all spent you’re not stressed. If you’re like me when you live frugally you tend to under-anticipate cost because you figure you’ll always find the cheaper version of something. Over-budgeting for cost and items typically results in some underspend which feels good for folks like you and me :)

He would have to work with you when planning upgrades but I would imagine he would rather stay with your plan and reduce the burden of cost and of starting something new.  Of course if he isn’t responsible in making on time payments or racks up extra charges it would be better to advise him that he has X long to get a new plan started.  As far as credit goes he’s probably better off getting a credit card and starting there.

hmcmi1m,mbensasi,11/27/2021,1,Tbh I don’t think it’s an issue for most people.

hmab05r,jaybetterman,11/27/2021,1,Sounds like you’ve already decided (lots of “cannot move” and “doing it anyway regardless”)   -are you okay if the house loses 20% of its value? -will you stay for at least 10 years?  -do you have 20% to put down?   If it’s a no to any of these you should NOT buy a house. Renting is perfectly fine while you save. You’re asking yourself if you get divorced are you protected when you really should be asking yourself with all the debt aren’t you liable?
hmbaajt,annalmsw,11/27/2021,1,Do not get married at 22. What’s the rush? Enjoy life on your own and learn about you be selfish.
hmc7lj8,EthanWS6,11/27/2021,1,Why would you stay the course when you specifically dont like the course?
hmadg9l,MathAndCS_Nerd,11/27/2021,1,Also for budgeting - as long as youre not living beyond your means for now take a few months and see what you spend on what. There are many budgeting apps that can help or just put it all in a spreadsheet. Figure out where very dollar goes - dining out rent clothes etc. See what categories you spend on and how much you spend on each category. Assess for yourself what you might be able to adjust - rent is fixed (at least under your lease) but maybe you can buy fewer new clothes. Or if you dont spend a lot on clothes maybe you spend a lot on entertainment. Maybe youre fine with how much you spend on each category but you just want to know what to do with extra money aka savings/retirement.  Once you get a high level view of your spending habits that will help you see where you can make adjustments (if any) and how much wiggle room you have in your finances. Also be sure to assess for yourself what your priorities are - maybe you want to keep your current lifestyle and save less or maybe you want to save more aggressively and are willing to give up a few luxuries for your savings/retirement. Only you can answer those kinds of things for yourself.  While its great to want to jump in head first and get started sooner than later a little while of learning budgeting and your own habits can make a huge difference. Starting now but blind is not as likely to go as well as starting in a few months with more knowledge and understanding.
hmayub5,burritodiva,11/27/2021,1,My partner and I just bought a house last year mid-pandemic. Had originally been looking at $175-200k houses with a combined income of ~$90k until I went on partial furlough due to covid. We ended up purchasing a $165k home ~$1100 mortgage payment.  Since then we’ve both gotten promotions And then I got a new job with a higher income. We now have ~$120K combined income.  A bigger yard nicer kitchen and extra bathroom would be nice but we don’t even fill the house as it is with just us (3br 1ba). Our mortgage and incomes leave us in a position where we don’t have to think much about our grocery budget (although I do plan all our meals and shop at Aldi) can go out to dinner on a whim and don’t sweat over repairs to our home or vehicles. We plan to have children in this house and should be able to afford daycare without losing all our all our luxuries.  I’m looking forward to our next house (in 7-10 years we always say) but this one perfectly suits our needs for this season of life.
hmd97j2,drdookie,11/27/2021,1,You can have a negative balance. It does increase your purchasing power.
hmd4pr5,red5765,11/27/2021,1,I definitely wasnt asking these questions at 21 so youre already doing great!  Id say make sure you have enough cash to cover your expenses for at least 3 months.  Then if youre working and your company has a 401(k) with a match then put some money there first.  They usually invest it in a target date fund which is okay to start.  Pay off any debt you have with >7% interest.  Check out the wiki of this page: [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index)  They divide things by age bracket and topic  Finally to answer your question on opening a Roth IRA and investing:  1. Pick a platform.  I like Vanguard but Fidelity is nice too    1. Vanguard [https://investor.vanguard.com/my-account/log-on](https://investor.vanguard.com/my-account/log-on) Hit Open an Account that should also walk you through it    2. Fidelity [https://login.fidelity.com/ftgw/Fidelity/RtlCust/Login/Init](https://login.fidelity.com/ftgw/Fidelity/RtlCust/Login/Init) Hit register now should walk you through opening the IRA 2. Setup your account to receive transfers from your checking account 3. BUY investments in the account.  Since youre new to this Id stick with an s&p500 index like VOO or VTI - VTI has no min investment requirement VOO is 3k 4. Once youve made the first investment purchase Id automate it! You can setup the account so it invests $50 or however much yo want every 2 weeks  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzNM8ugPL5o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzNM8ugPL5o)
hmbn5ty,Varathien,11/27/2021,1,Yes definitely sell the crypto to pay off debt.
hmco6z8,Eyebawler,11/27/2021,1,Then this your answer. Must meet deductible.
hmd3oik,OptionStrangler,11/27/2021,1,Most of the benefits revolve around taxes. A married couple making a combined $100000 for example will pay less in federal income taxes filing a married joint return than a single person earning $100000 filing a single return.  In addition there are some other benefits. For example if each partner works for a different employer that offers health insurance they have more health insurance options to pick and choose from.  https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0412/why-marriage-makes-financial-sense.aspx
hmc1r9a,thatgreenmaid,11/27/2021,1,We cannot afford any of this. Not the plane. Not the room. Not the car. Not the food. WE CANT AFFORD THIS. Repeat as needed.  If she doesnt like it tough.
hmb8r3q,arisaulrich,11/27/2021,1,Yes exactly Id just be using the money in the account to reserve the space. I wouldnt invest it at all until I had my emergency fund saved up in full.  At what point would you say I bonds might be relevant for me?  Thanks for your input.
hma2n54,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,That sounds like a safe harbor plan where all employees get a match and the employer gets a pass from the IRS on some employer 401k rules (Id have to research to be more specific).    As for only does a match with traditional 401k do you mean the matching only goes into a traditional? Thats actually an IRS requirement no employers pay into a roth 401k. They can match your roth contributions by paying into your traditional but they cant pay into your roth.

hmcmwfw,Nodeal_reddit,11/27/2021,1,Read up on /r/militaryfinance. Lots of good info over there.
hmbvver,Mobely,11/27/2021,1,If you stay get the offer in writing. Depending on your state most states will require your employer to make good on promises. So if you end up training your replacement you can sue or threaten to sue even in an at will state.
hmct0kc,samicballs,11/27/2021,1,I am with fidelity and its a taxable brokerage acct. Its really not a lot of money which is kinda swaying my idea to start fresh.
hmba1ea,snorkleface,11/27/2021,1,Yes 1000x yes sell the crypto to pay off the debts. Especially if you can knock two cards out immediately by doing so.
hmbexk0,Rosie-Disposition,11/27/2021,1,What do you want out of life?  Is collecting money really your number one goal?  Do you want a spouse? Kids? To see the world? To serve others? What do you want to reflect on when you are on your death bed? These are the things to spend money and time on. You won’t think about that really cool apartment you rented but you will think about feeling safe and cozy at the holidays making lifelong memories with your loved ones. You won’t think of that expensive jacket but you will think about that awesome concert where you wore it.  Your confidence is suffering for a fixable problem like acne? Why aren’t you don’t anything about it? Dude sign up for an online dermatologist today and your topical medication will arrive in the mail next week. If that doesn’t work after 3 months you can go get accutane from a doctor in person.  Afterwards at your salary some laser treatments will take care of most of the scarring. Why do you think you have to suffer through this?  You can also see a therapist to get to the bottom of why you put yourself through unnecessary hardship punishing yourself and holding yourself back in life.
hmb6bqs,ionlydrinkIPAs,11/27/2021,1,When people talk about a “thick” credit file they aren’t just talking about the number of credit cards you have. They are also talking about the length of your credit history (which you can’t do anything about) and your credit mix. A good credit mix will come with time and includes credit cards student loans auto loans mortgages etc.   You’ve already opened 4 new accounts of the exact same type in the last year or so. There really is no need to continue to open more CC accounts. You have a good score already and certain banks don’t like to see people opening a ton of accounts in a short period of time (e.g. Chase will automatically deny your CC application if you have more than 5 new accounts of any type within the last 24 months).
hm8vyxr,IBANDYQ,11/27/2021,5,Im not reading through all this - but has ANYONE come up with one good reason not to take measures?
hmccejs,EEpromChip,11/27/2021,1,Exactly this.  I dont know what gods were looking out for me (I assume Thor cause its a beard thing) but I landed a super awesome job.  How can I tell?  Because in the offer letter they specifically call out their non-compete clause.  Basically it states Non compete clauses are silly and useless.  You want to stay?  Great!  Well do our best to make you happy and keep you learning and satisfied.  You want to leave!  No problem we will help you however we can!.   I think the key is my company is built on partners that come from industry and know how to keep people happy.  They were on our side once and know what its like and what it takes to make happy employees.  It boggles my mind how easy it is to make your employees happy and keep them working and motivated.  Yet many companies just dont get it.  They want to micro-manage and make sure everyone is checked in at 8am and pounding keys until 5pm.  Half hour break is all you get and if you stray youll be docked!  Yuck-a-roo.
hmc7xfw,yes_its_him,11/27/2021,1,If you were buying stocks today would you buy these?    If not just sell.  Dont think you are going to eventually break even if its not a good holding.
hmaggq1,lolaya,11/27/2021,1,Yes its underfunded! OP do not sacrifice your retirement. Dont be negative about it either. You did good funding it with that but if you think negatively about it and regret funding it you will get into some bad habits
hmc8v1y,Dyeith95,11/27/2021,1,Also working with a team rather than being a one man department will most likely lead to your off time feeling more like off time. I know if I was in charge of a whole (I’m assuming marketing) department at a company I didn’t like work would easily follow me home. Count the value in your time off.
hmc4ydu,SolutionLeading,11/27/2021,1,Okay so you do need to provide a 60 day notice to terminate your lease.  Regarding the notification of rent increase the time limit would be outlined in your local laws for whatever state or city you live in probably not your lease.
hmd991p,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,Would probably avoid and look into REIT and get your high yield dividend this way.
hmd8sqd,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,1,I get the automobiles as a hobby thing but from a purely financial perspective its not a smart move.  You might be looking at a jumbo mortgage for a $900K house requiring $180K for down payment (20%). Assuming the $1250/mo savings rate you would need to save for like 12 years to accumulate that. Who knows what that $900K house (now) would cost then.
hm9xe2h,fabulousfred,11/27/2021,1,What terms do you want?  How quickly/slowly do you want to pay it off?  Do you have a bit of collateral (the car title?)?  If you talk to a repair shop they may offer you a payment plan to fix the car.  You may want to look into terms at a pawn shop.  If youre looking for an unsecured mini loan [youre looking for an angel.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AngelInvesting/)
hmcwhbb,PrayingMantisMirage,11/27/2021,1,I would suggest you have some joint accounts and some separate. Perhaps a joint checking account for shared bills a joint savings for saving. Then personal checking & savings. This gives you a good backup in case things ever do go wrong and you need a nest egg of your own to start your life over. It may be hard to envision things going wrong but having access to your own money can be crucial. IMO better to be safe than sorry. And that way you can both have your own fun money to spend on individual hobbies vices etc without annoying each other over spending joint money on it.
hm8vgse,burnttoast14,11/27/2021,1,IRS / CRA isnt gonna spend the resource$ to come after you for a measly 5k  Just dw about it…
hmcj4jl,Lovetea365,11/27/2021,1,It may take time but creating and using a secured credit card is an option to build credit history in the us.
hmc0enz,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1,Join me I avoid trying to mention Vanguard or the tickers of their index funds.
hmaah6p,ThighOfTheTiger,11/27/2021,1,Strategy should not change based on whether you are contributing to the account or not. You may want more tax inefficient funds in the IRA. This is known as asset location.
hmag8ry,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,> vanguard will not hold another mutual fund company’s funds  They will but there will be fees to buy and sell.  Id sell the funds at AF before doing the transfer just to make things easier.
hmcrnoa,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,1,Yes and he told me that 60% of the time it works every time.
hmbs7i7,pacarosandwich,11/27/2021,1,Tax breaks though
hmct2a9,SnooDonuts2973,11/27/2021,1,I guess my question is how much excess would they sue me for since a new lower number was never mentioned? They could say the rate for my new position is 2 dollars and there would be nothing I can do?
hmd84ug,etblo,11/27/2021,1,Ok ill call them monday and see if they have a record of the guy fixing the leak maybe thatll help
hmafsfh,Pythias1,11/27/2021,1,I think hes almost certainly right about paying your loans first. Unless you have very low interest on your loans the cost of paying the loans slowly will outweigh the benefit of the match from your employer.  If your dad is saying to contribute $2-4k thats ~4-8% of your income anyway. If youre already contributing $2k the company will contribute $1k. The most your employer will ever contribute is just ~1.5k (3% of your salary) so if you contribute just $2k your only leaving $500 on the table from your employer. Definitely check your loans interest rate but I think its unlikely that increasing your contribution to $3k makes sense right now.  Also note that contributing $4k the upper limit of the range you and your dad discussed may not be the best idea. Youd probably be better off opening a Roth IRA and funding it with whatever you can afford to save beyond 6% of your salary.  Edit: OP said elsewhere they have only 1/2 month of expenses in liquid accounts. OP you have got to put more savings away before you throw lots of money at the 401(k). My own strategy was to put money into a ROTH IRA as an emergency fund because you can withdraw Roth contributions at any time. Your 401(k) is not to be included in emergency fund calculations because you will pay a penalty for accessing that money early.   I think your father is trying to gently tell you that what youre doing is reckless. He doesnt want to be your safety net when you do earn enough to make the right choices and be secure.

hm8yxuj,BerryGoosey,11/27/2021,1,I froze mine on the big three for myself spouse and minor children years ago. When involved in anything where they’re asking for my social I ask if they need credit pulled and ask where they get it from and I do a temporary lift from my phone browser.   I also froze it on chex tracks and maybe a few other reporting agencies. Google around for others.
hmd8049,Happydivorcecard,11/27/2021,1,You don’t. You need to have either a big cash flow on the property or lots of cash on hand to pay for repairs. And a single bad tenant can wipe out years of profits. Rental property is not an investment for people that are close to the bone. Put your money in an index fund. If you build up enough that you can put a large enough down payment on a property to have good cashflow and have a good amount left over for emergencies then consider buying but compare it to what the returns are on your index fund and account for risk.
hmb47pf,Nagare,11/27/2021,1,I know everyone else is saying look at other services but if you dont want to switch away keep in mind that you get discounts for number of lines serviced usually and the best rates typically come in around 4 lines.

hmabsca,1hotjava,11/27/2021,1,For self employed people it’s more difficult to secure a mortgage since income is not as steady. I’d think that 8mo of business income isn’t enough to establish a track record and thus why the mortgage broker is wanting him to take SS benefits since that’s guaranteed. Previous job income is irrelevant since that’s not future income which the bank looks at  The broker BTW is trying to make it so that dad is more likely yo get approved but they don’t actually approve loans that’s the underwriters job and they have the final say. So that’s why the broker is wishy-washy on it.
hmd4bol,6AMDxGMxCrypto9,11/27/2021,1,Good luck getting money out of the 403b you think you’re putting your own money in but really it’s a controlled brokerage account all the employees also contribute to but have to gain permission from the TPA/Plan Admin to withdraw the funds.

hmaj8j7,TrainToWilloughby,11/27/2021,1,Depending on where the OP lives one month worth of daycare can easily cost more than a nice two week vacation.
hmab6qo,Inevitable_Welcome23,11/27/2021,1,I would say save for longer/buy a smaller house. As that 10k would be worth around 80k when you retire.   Plus retirement contributions are statistically cut down significantly after a home purchase since a mortgage is only one of the many costs that go into owning a home. Most people buy a home that has a mortgage slightly lower than their rent but fail to realize that there are other expenses like property taxes insurance much higher utility bills (1.5-2x higher than an apartment) hvac/plumbing/foundation/leaky roof/other repair bills and the costs associated with purchasing extra furniture to fill the bigger space. So there will be no “I’ll just invest more next year to make up for this withdrawal/401k loan” like many people assume there will be.   In fact in this market almost all entry level house are getting sold “as is” so the sellers are getting away with selling houses with broken/nearly broken major house systems because they can. Waiting for the market to cool to get the same house for maybe 10-30k more in three years is not as bad of a deal if you factor in repair leverage that was a normal condition in contracts before 2020.  New HVAV: 10-20k New hot water heater: 5-10k Plumbing repairs: 500-10k+ Electrical repairs: 500-10k+ Foundation/structure repairs: 2000-20k Leaky roof/new roof: 500-15k+  There are more but buying right now is a huge risk right now due to the lack of inventory and repair leverage.

I’m not advocating that for your mom but he does a great job explaining the importance of savings rate and expenses and how the higher your savings rate (and thus lower the expenses) the less years you have to work. That could be a resource for you guys going forward.

hm9wr63,UMfan11244,11/27/2021,1,So there are a few answers.   First get the match no matter what. Then open a Roth IRA (Fidelity would be great). Once the Roth IRA is maxed work toward hitting the annual limit for the 401(k) which is $20.5k for 2022.   I could expand and say you should get a HDHP with an HSA account but that’s completely on you.
hmbm3e9,Scarface74,11/27/2021,1,As others have said ssa.gov.   But to add on anyone who has 10 years of work experience can get projections. It also shows your reported wage income for your entire career.   For me it went back to 1995.
hmd075q,dequeued,11/27/2021,1,Yeah. You can just switch without a huge tax bill then. Just bear in mind that if the value of the funds has appreciated you will need to pay capital gains tax which is higher if youve held them less than a year (its basically taxed at the same rate as your marginal income tax rate).  The investing section of the PF wiki has more information on funds three-funds portfolios etc.
hmda1xo,squishyfibbins,11/27/2021,1,Thanks everyone for the advice! Ill update here how it goes Monday.
hmavtim,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Lol I hate to break it to you but the US government specifically the Patriot Act has eliminated any right to privacy at your bank.  Quite the opposite is happening. Banks are getting huge fines for KYC/ AML violations.    The government wants the banks to be all up in your business so they can pretend no money is going to our enemies.   My bank takes your complaints about this and uses it as evidence that we are strictly adhering to the government requirements.    Hate the game not the players. Your fight for privacy should be in DC.    https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer  Edit: The future of KYC/AML will be artifical intelligence where machines can get up in your business at a mass efficiency low cost

hmbdn02,diatho,11/27/2021,1,Youre not exactly sharing creds but I get your point.   At this point no financial firm is building a good api they dont want you to leave their site. Fidelity actually lets you import your financial data from other institutions into their site.   I would build a robust excel dashboard download your statements and parse them.
hma93nl,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,> Im not sure what it means for any eventual divorce issues.  If divorce isnt on the table then it means nothing.  Even if divorce was on the table it still means nothing.  Because likely what youre getting at is Can my ex-husband steal the home from under me?  This is why divorce involves lawyers.  You get a lawyer to split the assets and claim your fair share.  Generally assets acquired after marriage are split 50/50.  Deviation from that can happen depending on individual circumstances and local law.  I would say go for whatever works out in your favor as a couple.  If youre worried about divorce its too late for a pre-nuptial agreement.  However though generally less strong you can indeed pursue a POST-nuptial agreement.    The intent of this document is to alleviate any fears regarding how to split assets in the event of divorce.  The bigger benefit is the discussions between the two of you that lead up to the document.

Bear in mind that buying a house as a non-resident alien is going to mean more hoops to jump through. If you can wait until you have your green card its not quite so tricky.
hmacw4n,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,The payoff for pre-paying on the mortgage is only 3% (or whatever your interest rate is).    The stock market has payed over 20% this year has averaged over 15% for a long time and has historically averaged 10% annually over any 30 year period.   Another way to look at it is the fastest way to get to $0 mortgage is to invest until the investment total is equal/higher than the mortgage balance.

hm9wyw9,No-Inflation-842,11/27/2021,1,One should compare current variable yield to inflation indexed yield on the bonds traded by institutional investors.    The large investors are paying the government to get similar inflation protection as yields are negative (5 year is negative 1.8) https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/ on Nov 26).     Series I can be redeemed earlier and at par so you know your downside compared to the big shots at the institutions (if negative 1.8 rate turns positive 1 the loss in market price will be 10%+ ).    Market is not efficient here and the small saver is getting at least 10%more  over 5 years than the buyer of inflation linked bonds in the institutional marketplace.    The roughly exact calculation is 3.55 (6month)  guaranteed plus 0 (guaranteed or possibly higher) versus negative 1.8 over the next 4.5 years.
hmbw8zn,bros402,11/27/2021,1,Never trust the doctor (or in this case their PA) about something being in network. Always check with your insurance if a facility is in network (check through your account on their website - do not use the doctor/facility finder for guests to the site) - doctors and their staff do not know what your plans cover.    Example: With one of my doctors they do blood tests at their office every time I visit and send the blood off to a nationally known laboratory. In the two weeks between visits my insurance stopped covering the laboratory but my doctor did not know yet and I got a bill for it (luckily my insurance has a very very generous out of network coverage option). I still had to pay the balance and after that my doctor has sent my blood to the other nationally known laboratory company.

hmbi0ax,OperaticIguana,11/27/2021,1,Yikes. Heat pumps dont work as efficiently if the temperature is below 40 so I think theyre generally not recommended as primary heating for northern climates.  But it definitely sounds like the backup heating coils are running all the time.
hmb5tdd,JeanATannen,11/27/2021,1,If I were in your position I’d stretch the house budget a bit and get something that you are happy with. Housing is such a mess and it’s so difficult to get something right now and it just gets harder every year.   You cannot easily scale up your house with each raise you get so I don’t think the lifestyle creep with housing is as much of a concern especially if you like your house.   What will probably happen over the next 5 years is that the novelty of your house will wear off you’ll be making more money and you’ll be tempted to up the house budget again. You’ll have to re-evaluate your priorities then and trust your future self to make a smart decision. You can help your future self by staying in control of your finances and keeping track of your long term goals and what you’ll need to do to achieve them. I’d recommend bumping your 401k contributions for starters.

hmburg6,BastidChimp,11/27/2021,1,Do research on the Chase Trifecta. They include cards like the Chase Freedom Flex Chase Freedom Unlimited. Both of these cards are no annual fee cards with points and cash back. The Trifecta is completed with either the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve cards. Both of these have annual fees of $95 and $595 respectively. These have perks for traveling as well as dining. With all of these cards you can combine all the points under one account for purchases on Amazon or book flight with certain carriers.

hma36j8,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,I agree but I just worry about paying them back. Based on my calculations if theyre correct then I think I would end up with at least $10000 in savings and still have no debt IF I keep working both jobs until I graduate. Meanwhile if I only work one job and take out more loans Ill just have more loans and nothing in savings... But theres always the risk that Ill fail a class from running out of time to complete an assignment fall asleep driving etc. so Im not sure if the other job is worth it. Maybe if I can find a PT job with a better schedule. Thank you!

hmafrg9,joeshmo39,11/27/2021,1,She works full time in a high stress job and will spend a week of vacation or more watching an infant or newborn? You should be positive on that before you make any plans.
hmbf2wu,invenio78,11/27/2021,1,Most people when they get married will share ownership of assets.  Like their house cars bank accounts brokerage accounts.  Thus one one spouse gets sued these will be all fair game.  Also risk doesnt necessarily come with occupation.  The mail man slip on your front porch and sues you for $2 million...  I guess you could make really complicated asset separation to try and keep assets separate but 50% on each side but even then you are basically back to the original risk of being not married.  Marriage innately does not give asset protection that two unmarried people wouldnt intrinsically have.
hmb6iee,mikezampz,11/27/2021,1,Being frugal is good but if it comes to a point where it stops you from enjoying life then you have to ask yourself these questions: Why are you working and saving money for in the first place? So you can enjoy life later on? But why can’t you let yourself enjoy your life now by spending a little? Can you truly say you lived a life if it was miserable because you were so strict on your spending that it caused you to be miserable? How can you guarantee that you’ll be alive at the age you plan to retire? You have to think about these things. Enjoy your life now and your future self by treating yourself from time to time and still saving some money. You don’t have to spend massively to enjoy your life now. Just enough. My husband used to be frugal and not spend on himself. I asked him the same questions and was able to encourage him to start enjoying his life now because you never know how life’s gonna be later on. He was thankful after some time. XD
hmb6476,pownedju,11/27/2021,1,Sorry if it was unclear. My insurance is like $90. Car is about $240. I shopped around and that was the cheapest for my 2016 Scion FR-S with a spotless driving record for 12 years.
hmbdxg1,asparagus21,11/27/2021,1,Its weird but the cost is almost the same to have the heat set to 60 (our minimum) vs 68. So unfortunately setting the heat to low doesnt affect the bill much turning off the heat slashes it dramatically though.
hmai3ic,fawningandconning,11/27/2021,1,How are you an E.R. Nurse without health insurance? I guess you mean youre a travel nurse?   Hospitals have cash rates and you can get on a payment plan.
hm9p568,52Lewis20Reed,11/27/2021,1,Yeah good point lol. Im just being extra stingy right now but youre right-- if Im not willing to pull out the stocks now when would I ever be willing? I got a long way to go before I hit that retirement age.   And thats a question I had that I shouldve posted- do I get taxed at all for the money I take out in retirement if I utilize the loan system? FWIW aside from the money Ive put into the account the gains Ive made on my retirement account are pretty insignificant.
hmcl4m6,dendari,11/27/2021,1,Is the $2500 finance charge the interest you will pay or an extra fee?  How much interest are you going to for the loans you have currently?
hmcqmov,nothlit,11/27/2021,1,> My current 401k provider wants Fidelity (thats where my IRA is) to mail ME a check made out to NEW PROVIDER which Ill then send along to the new provider. It just seems kinda weird and not super convenient.  Thats a common way of doing a rollover nothing particularly weird about it.  > Is there any way I could just do a roth conversion on the money already in the traditional IRA to empty out the traditional account?  You can but you will of course have to pay income tax on the amount you convert. Thats what youd be avoiding by rolling it into the 401k instead.
hmbtv3q,phone_bone,11/27/2021,1,this wont pay the bills immediately but look into Web3 and NFT photography
hmcgbb0,kepler1,11/27/2021,1,They will tell by the fact that for the year you will have underpaid by several thousand $ (if it is as you said).   When you do your taxes that amount of underpayment will trigger the filing of forms 2210 (Underpayment of tax) and 1040-ES.  The online tax preparers will flag this as well.   On that form(s) is a quarterly (every 3 months) laying out of what was supposed to be due and how much you actually paid.  You yourself will have to calculate this although in theory as with all taxes the IRS already knows.   There are 2 methods for calculating how much should have been paid but roughly the idea is that in each quarter you should have paid tax on the amount of income during that quarter.    So it probably is in your interest (unless you dont mind the penalty) to make an estimated payment roughly according to the amount you will underpay due to the extra income in the quarter in which is received.    You can read these for more info:   https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306 (Underpayment penalty)  https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2210.pdf (the quarterly schedule)   https://www.irs.gov/payments/underpayment-of-estimated-tax-by-individuals-penalty   and  https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes  (estimated tax payments quarterly -- see Chapter 2 Who has to pay)

hmcuq1b,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,I would get rid of your VOO if its considered long term by now unless you dont mind short term capital gains tax and stick with your fidelity index funds.
hm8y1er,BankEmoji,11/27/2021,296,Yes this is how it actually works. The lawyers will ask a bunch of predictable questions such as:  -	How long has this been going on? -	Have there been any other victims? -	Have these activities cross state lines? -	Are there other malicious insiders? -	Has this scam been successful? -	If so how much money involved? -	Are credit cards affected (PCI)?  If HR goes in and just fires the malicious actor right away the investigation could be seriously impacted.   Allowing a criminal to continue committing crimes under your watchful eye is the best way to both create the air tight case you need before referring the case to the USSS or FBI for LE intervention (which may be a requirement) but also to determine the scope and impact of the activities.   Scope would be things like “how many users were contacted how often did the scams work how many insiders are doing these things”.   Impact would be “How many dollars are involved which government agencies must be notified will this have material impact on the brand/business”.   Watching a criminal commit crimes while you are collecting evidence is just the best.

hmc4xjo,kboogie82,11/27/2021,1,Use a no annual fee credit card (or cards if you can manage more than one) with good cash rewards back. Pay them off every month or like I do biweekly on pay day. Track your spending dont over spet disregard 0% apr period. Use the cash back to find a Roth IRA if you qualify. Use part of  your consumption to find your retirement. Credit is a tool.
hm9r1r6,dadading_dadadoom,11/27/2021,1,Whom is the check payable to? If it has FBO [your name] then you can rollover to IRA (Fidelity or TRoweprice) or 401k (new employer).  If it has only your name  likely its wages then you need additional documentation to support its 401k funds.

hm932rk,21twilli,11/27/2021,1,If my calculations are correct then after everything is paid for you’re left with ~$882-$922 per month. That means it’ll take you ~6-10 months to save that $5000-$8000. You’re gonna need a higher paying job if you want to save it quicker.
hmc75o7,bulk-traitor-coffee,11/27/2021,1,Just to be clear you believe that if I call the bank and ask for a lower interest rate or a freeze on it that they will *raise* it instead?
hmayje3,Varathien,11/27/2021,1,Marriage doesnt have to cost anything. Well a few dollars in court paperwork.   Weddings can range from the affordable to the ludicrously expensive.   Divorce is incredibly expensive. It sounds like youre already doing a good job at talking about things like combining your finances. But if theres any issue that you think might result in a big fight in 5 years... probably best to talk about it now.
hmajhg7,freya_246,11/27/2021,1,Pharmacy techs should be making at least 35k a year if she has been doing this for a decade in the same place she is probably making more.

hmbj5za,Wahoo2K8,11/27/2021,1,Not sure why this was downvoted.  I worked for years in the field as an insurance adjuster and there were absolutely tow lots that were run as transparently and as professionally as any other business.  Of course there were some awful tow lots as well.   And there are probably a higher proportion of shady businesses in the tow industry.   But your response that not all tow lots are known to be a “complete scam” is spot on.

You shouldnt be worried but you should be properly allocated as youre closer to retirement.   >  It’s definitely scary not knowing if I’m invested in something that can rebound.

hmaatm7,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,Theres a misperception that the courts can decide who gets the tax break (deduction) for a child (or children).   The IRS doesnt care what the court says. Do your own research (can start with below link) and consider confirming with a short consult with a fee-only professional. Generally the parent who has custody more than 50% of the time is allowed to claim the child as dependent.    Also filing first matters in that if you file first your refund will be processed. Should he file a return later using the same (childs) SSN as a dependent that will trigger a review before issuing the second credit.  Finally if you are getting that much of a refund stop loaning the government your money interest free adjust your withholding (if you havent already).

hma76ac,TK_TK_,11/27/2021,1,This is the silliest view people have on marriage. Who cares if you have a romantic view on it or not—it’s a legal contract that confers a huge amount of benefits. If you have a partner you want to get a mortgage with you should get married first. If you don’t want to marry someone you don’t want to buy a house with them.

If there is no safety net get quotes for selling your car to dealerships.  My guess is that you could probably sell it for the balance owed unless you were underwater on a trade.  You could probably get more if you sold it privately but people are incredibly flaky and a sale likely wont happen quickly.

hmb94pf,Rubily00,11/27/2021,1,Also scores fluctuate naturally over time. The heuristics used to pull the number are sloppy and weird and a +-20 swing is about the natural range with no major changes. Try not to stress too much about it.  Lenders often dont care about the specific number at all and instead will be looking at *specific factors* they favor. Some lenders may not care at all about thin files but care a lot about DTI ratio. Others dont care a ton about your income but want to see a long history of payments. Each will calculate their own type of score with different criteria. Focus on building good habits and dont stress so much about this.

I am also concerned at future downward pressure on those salaries as working remotely from eastern europe and India will be the same as working in California.
hmaqaxl,monkeyleg18,11/27/2021,1,Not sure Ill make sure to request one this next time.
hmc3o9x,j-christopher,11/27/2021,1,Address the age of your oldest account and your average age of accounts.  Time (waiting) is one way but another is to have a relative or trusted friend add you as an authorized user on a seasoned Visa or Mastercard credit card.    These report as opened the same month/year as the account owner (Amex authorized user cards report as new accounts thats why I called out V/MC).  Make sure you choose someone who pays their bill on time every month and keeps utilization under control.  The balance and payment history are reported for better or for worse.
hmbb5uu,PurpleParrotFish,11/27/2021,1,Not really if you haven’t combined money it really isn’t wise to use both savings accounts for a new car to share for example. Also my religion does not allow for living together unmarried.
hmd3j8p,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,>If the mortgage payments are $1500 per month will the fact that person B’s commitment is 75% of his monthly income be looked down upon by the lender or will it not matter because the total commitment is only 14% of the total joint income?  It doesnt matter since its a joint mortgage
hmbj0sh,champac,11/27/2021,1,No I dont use any of them
hmchx70,quelindolio,11/27/2021,1,It can be magical. Few things beat sleeping with the windows open in the summer and feeling an actual breeze and hearing crickets at night. I plan to do it again some day. But there is a reason the Texas hill country is filled with ranches owned by those who don’t have to work for a living and/or can afford to pay someone to run them. Getting up at 4 am for chores before going to school or to work for 8 hours every single day is tough.
hmam39s,FindFIREsomeday,11/27/2021,1,Hold your assets? I think thats the lesson there.   Dont panic sell.  Having an emergency fund is an important piece of being able to do that.
hmacleq,digitalhelix84,11/27/2021,1,The US banking system is exceptionally heavily regulated.  NACHA (US) and SEPA (EU) are more or less pretty similar.  Online bill pay will first look to see if the recipient is registered to receive the payment electronically if not they will mail a check to them. At first they would treat it like a check and debit the account when the check was cashed but people actually hated this because it was unpredictable. So they moved to debiting the accounts on the date the payment was promised by.  I cant really compare this to Europe but considering how much of bill payments are done this way vs the number of actual errors its pretty close to six sigma levels of accuracy.
hmbx7zf,COVID-19Enthusiast,11/27/2021,1,Honestly unless you think youre doing a bad job and your boss doesnt like you I would just sit down with him and discuss everything you just said. It sounds like he cares and if he doesnt then you take the other job which is what it sounds like youre worried could happen anyway. I think this is going to work out for you.
hmacxna,prettyplum32,11/27/2021,1,Marriage is simply a contract where you combine two people into one legal unit.   This means for taxes it’s not your income it’s both of your income (although you can also file married separately). This means you have access to each other’s benefits at work. It means you have automatic beneficiary designations for life insurance/retirement accounts/medical and end of life decisions. It means anything bought (big stuff like houses worthless stuff like silverware) legally belong to both of you.   Marriage itself is not expensive or cheap it completely depends on your own situations. Some people end up paying more in taxes after marriage some end up paying less. Some people’s spouses take out credit cards in their name in secret some people’s spouses are financially literate. It just totally depends.   The fact that you’ve asked this to me means you don’t have the requisite life experience needed to decide who and when to marry yet. Move in together if you want live as actual adults for a while before you decide. Marriage is very easy to do and very very expensive to undo. You don’t want to rush into it.
hmd5ztq,Lurker117,11/27/2021,1,That is the correct logic.  After 10k in the account you can actually pick your investment vehicle for the money.  The catch is that you can reimburse yourself for medical expenses that you paid out of pocket for you cant just take the money out for no reason later in life and buy a house.  You need to keep every receipt and invoice from every medical expense you pay out of pocket.  I recommend scanning them and keeping them digitally in a folder as well as on the cloud so you dont lose them.  Were talking 40 years of bills when its all said and done.  Then you can reimburse yourself for all of that out of your account tax-free after it has gained 30-40 years of interest on the principal.
hmatq3c,Getmybaby,11/27/2021,1,Switch banks. Its not their business why you need your own money.  If they are small and only local they likely dont have enough cash kept on hand to meet reserve minimums or only keep just enough to stay legal.  I would notify your state banking regulator.
hmbzidh,Several-Watch-186,11/27/2021,1,I’d rent out some of the rooms then it wouldn’t cost you 40% of your income
hmakiab,Salty_Peak8156,11/27/2021,1,Yea and just for reference the card hasnt even come in the mail yet. So I dont think itll hurt the average age of my accounts? And the limit on it is FAR less than my other card
hmbue9y,3rdIQ,11/27/2021,1,I dont think you can ever do too much too early.  You can always make alterations later on in life but having compound interest working for you over a longer period of time will pay off big time.  Do yourself a favor and confirm the rules with the Top Hat 457b plan you are in in fact confirm the rules twice.   **In some cases** they can not be rolled over into an IRA when you retire.  My wife was advised that her 457b could be rolled over and at the last minute a Vanguard advisor (where those monies lived) who was handling the transfer on the employers behalf advised us it would be paid in a lump sum with all the tax consequences.
hmb44e0,thentangler,11/27/2021,1,Those are still expenses.  If you are currently working in a job that is an excellent baseline to compare. You can see how much you are netting after taxes with those increased expenses.  This site has been very useful and the most accurate for me:  https://www.irscalculators.com/tax-calculator
hmbs7th,cornstock2112,11/27/2021,1,He wont be able to provide advice unless youre working with him and hes being compensated. Financial advice isnt automatically included by virtue of keeping money at an institution. The advisor would be opening themselves up to a great deal of liability if they were offering advice without understanding your whole financial picture.
hmbkmh8,Undercovergreen,11/27/2021,1,The difference of $50 isnt a lot and you need to see what the exact specs of your current insurance are. ie deductible/liability coverage.
hma9zpl,PriBake,11/27/2021,1,Just something to consider maybe now maybe in the future. Every time I get a raise I take about half of it and put it in my 401k so if I made a 4percent raise before I even see it I take 2percent and just add to my 401k that way I still get a raise but also still save without seeing it so I don’t miss it.
hma6b65,Dahkelor,11/27/2021,1,Highly approved mentality.  Anyway as for your question since real estate is almost always an investment of sorts I wouldnt consider a nicer house necessarily as lifestyle creep. Its all the other stuff.
hm9tolb,aushimself,11/27/2021,1,If your rate is low on the mortgage it makes sense to invest the additional funds in the IRA as you have limited time to do that.  Edit: compound interest is a blessing down the road
hm91xit,unlistedname,11/27/2021,3,Take the $1500 best money youll get for a salvage title that needs probably its full value in repairs and cant pass inspections.   Might be able to take it out of state or trade it in but doubt youd get more than the $1500 since its got a salvage title needs repairs and has a low book value as is. Also Im not 100% sure its legal to sell a car that doesnt meet inspection there or to take it out of state to bypass those laws.   Repairing it would set you at $900 profit given the values you did but I think the numbers are high for what youd get out so its not worth it.
hmb5vcl,terpischore761,11/27/2021,1,I picked a target date find that is 10 years after my actual goal retirement date. This way it stays in stocks a bit longer. I’m pretty aggressive though. Your risk tolerance may vary.

hmat6x3,93195,11/27/2021,1,Either way.  I like paying it off right away to keep utilization low but as long as you’re paying the whole balance before the due date you won’t pay interest which is the important thing.
hmbol7d,whatsmynamema,11/27/2021,1,No the when being the inevitable meaning I would wait until whenever it goes back up because it always does. I couldn’t put any kind of date on it just hope it’s within the next few weeks or I’ll probably just sell regardless
hmbtkxl,Huey107010,11/27/2021,1,For you it sounds like you need to live independently for at least a year before marrying. But that will never happen as you are already dating and want to get married.  The issues aren’t necessarily with finances as much as it is maturity.  How old is your sister?
hmcohwc,KReddit934,11/27/2021,1,Yes I think Ill try to figure it out.
hmcbrnx,jcruzyall,11/27/2021,1,You were ready to replace him... fairs fair.  You have an opportunity here to exit in a way that could raise your standing generally... not like someone who was just doing a job but whose work was acknowledged as important. in the best case you help with the transition and end up a hero. Not all departures have to be hostile or involve burning bridges.
hmbnorr,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1,FICO claims their score is used in 90% of lending decisions. Im unaware of any lender that uses Vantagescore.  Another thing to keep in mind is you have 3 different credit reports and you could be seeing a FICO score based on Equifax for e.g. and a Vantagescore from Transunion. There could be a collections account on Transunion that is dropping your scores. Generally for someone with established credit history the scores tend to be pretty similar.

hmc3dxi,joncell3,11/27/2021,1,Some Vanguard mutual funds have a minimum investment ([$3000 for example](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax)).  Once I invest $3000 to meet the minimum do I always have to add money in increments of $3000 or greater? Or can I add funds in smaller amounts as long as I maintain a balance greater than $3000 at the time?

hmbu2e5,Earthquake14,11/27/2021,1,The rent market is also pretty crazy. Out rent has gone up ~$100 past 2 years. For the same money we’re paying now we could afford house 2x as big in the current market.
hmc1a0t,AutoCrossMiata,11/27/2021,1,Not always highly depends on the workplace and manager.
hmccplr,beattothepunch,11/27/2021,1,It depends.  If your mortgage will only be under your name they won’t consider her mortgage.
hm9if6i,decaturbob,11/27/2021,2, a co-signer is co-signing the mortgage and hence is a borrower. That does not lead to ownership unless name is on deed/title
hma00rj,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,Im so sorry to hear about your accident. Thats exactly why I quit my second job a few weeks ago because there were occasional nights when I would feel drowsy driving home and I was afraid of accidentally killing someone. I may move my graduation date back one  more semester but I think there would be more problems if I move it any more than that. Thank you.
hmd7avq,LetsBeCoolMan,11/27/2021,1,Hahaha hmm she did have me sign a prenup… lol jk! Appreciate it! It’s a hard time to buy right now so who knows
hm99zen,bearjing,11/27/2021,1,I would max out your match first. But keep it as cash in the account till you build up to your desired emergency savings. After you hit that then invest the rest. If you do an early withdraw youll have to pay a penalty but with the matching from the company youll still come out ahead. Though this is assuming the company match is vested immediately.  Normally it is bad to keep money as cash in your retirement accounts. But this is your emergency savings atm till you can build it up outside of your retirement accounts. And the most predictable time youll need the emergency savings is when the economy is tanking and you lose your job which is a terrible time to sell stock.  As for your student loans that depends on the interest rates of the loans and your personal risk tolerance. But you really shouldnt be paying them while they are at 0%.
hmcur9c,cloverdoodles,11/27/2021,1,Except doctors don’t know the details of your health insurance coverage. Doctors participate in insurance networks. Many networks have many different plans that result in different patient financial responsibility depending on the plan. Doctors do not know this off the top of their heads. Frankly they don’t know it even if you tell them I have X HD Plan. If you need to know costs before a procedure you have to have the office send the claim in for preapproval from your insurance company (or learn how your plan works). Sometimes it is opaque as it’s unclear how a procedure is taxonomized by the insurance company and calling the insurance company (who would think to do that?!) first will tell you what to expect.  Mechanics on the other hand are often the direct business owner who sets prices.
hmd0lxe,erotictravel,11/27/2021,1,My original statement is correct just because you want to read more into the OP than is there does not change that fact.
hmay3nm,Ray_725,11/27/2021,1,Thank you and I greatly appreciate your response!
hm9pl0t,nanaroo,11/27/2021,1,Are your parents in poor health?  Do you know if they have done any estate planning or have a will?  Late 50s is still fairly young and pre-retirement. Its entirely possible they have a plan of their own. Maybe you should approach them and ask them what their wishes are.  If theyve done estate planning theyll likely tell you. You. If they have not this could be a good conversation to get them thinking about it.   Doing anything else is sticking your nose where it doesnt belong.
hmckooy,FourthPrince-4040,11/27/2021,1,I don’t understand you see to be in the market are they offering you what you want.  However I would want to get to know then working environment a little more. Chat up the works people always gossip
hmbqvjs,MDfoodie,11/27/2021,1,Do what’s best for you.   Why is she charging you full commission as your mother-in-law? This seems like she is getting all the benefits and you are getting the shaft.
hm9lx2c,the1righttool,11/27/2021,2,Constantly changing auto pay and bill payment would be a hassle.
hm9cmzc,radwagonier,11/27/2021,1,Will he and his wife be getting social security on top of that? They could be set up to live on $9k/mo (108k/yr).   Given that a Roth IRA might be a good idea since he might be in a high tax bracket in retirement (especially so if he becomes a widower).  Since he might not need this money to live on I might take on a bit more risk in terms of asset allocation.
hmco7y3,BruceCourteous4444,11/27/2021,1,what S&P500 index fund would you recommend?
hmbmjmu,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,Not sure how you pulled your scores but I just want to emphasize that a credit report is not the same thing as a credit score.   A credit report basically shows a history of any credit lines you currently have or have had in the past as well as your payment history for each. Credit scores (like the most often referred to FICO score) are calculated based on applying proprietary formulas to the data contained within your credit report. A 10-20 point difference between scores calculated by different agencies isnt that odd but I would be concerned seeing 30+ point differences.
hmd0dec,Youngbloods113,11/27/2021,1,They either require a deposit to open the account or I get denied.
hmc8ojv,titogruul,11/27/2021,1,I also read this as an opportunity to build your own team: seems like the boss has recognized scaling issues and is offering for the OP to learn how to run a small marketing department while giving them resources to do so.  It might be possible to smoke this out by engaging in some conversations about the future of the marketing department: if the boss is elusive then something is fishy. If however they have plans/needs for the business etc then that would be a sign that theyre honestly trying to fix this.
hmb9qtc,memepeasant,11/27/2021,1,I second this. It sounds really interesting and something Id like to learn more about too
hm9nkzo,swampler22,11/27/2021,1,From my search so far it actually appears that employers are allowed to do this though.
hm9wr3g,iamnewnewnew,11/27/2021,1,>Even accounting for discounted cash flows or simple interest it would still be greater than the 1st NPV. What gives? Why would anyone choose the 1st investment over the 2nd?  The issue is youre looking at 2 very different comparisons.
hmc5y5k,dequeued,11/27/2021,1,Youre welcome.  Assuming youre at Schwab you might consider a US total stock market fund for future purchases (especially in a taxable account). That would be SWTSX if you want to use a mutual fund or a more tax-efficient ETF like VTI or SCHB. Either of the latter two funds are probably your best option for a taxable account.  Another option would be purchasing an extended market ETF like VXF to round out your US stocks if you want to [approximate the US total stock market](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_stock_market) overall.  Or just keep doing what youre doing.  The only other thing Ill add is that if the market drops significantly it can sometimes be an opportunity to switch funds without incurring capital gains. (For any funds in an IRA or other tax-advantaged account you could switch to different funds at any time without worrying about capital gains.)
hmb87mw,VegasOldPerv,11/27/2021,1,Have her get out of a traditional retail setting. A wholesale club like Sams Club a mail order pharmacy or learning med center/ hospital Rx. All can be less stressful than a retail chain like Rite Aid or CVS. Even a specialty compounding pharmacy would be less stressful and more interesting.   Pharmacy techs are in demand. Show her all the job listings in her area. Hopefully that can boost her confidence with all the experience she has.

hmd47a2,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,1,Thank you. I understand the overall concept and math behind how compounding interest works.

hmchkbm,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,If its an actual pension its unlikely you can take any sort of in service withdrawal. If its a 401k maybe.
hmadq1e,Ambitious_Review2065,11/27/2021,1,Do you plan to have more kids soon? If not 600k should be doable. Otherwise Id stick around 500k.  Are you set on a specific city or West Cosst in general?
hmcgdnr,Inb4BanAgain,11/27/2021,1,The key is resolve. You have to be willing to make it happen. Learning to do something that makes you valuable. Working more hours and days than you want. Saying no to instant gratification and spending like youre a congressman.    Education is great but there are a lot of masters degrees serving coffee at Starbucks.
hm90nyf,applepiecorgi,11/27/2021,2,Depends. Some will deny if the person isn’t on the policy. I see that more often with substandard carriers/ policies. Some policies have language stating there’s no coverage for unlisted household members who have regular access to the vehicle. With insurance you really should just read the policy to know what’s covered and excluded because the worst time to find out something isn’t covered is after an accident/ some other event that you thought was covered.
hmcf1p3,pokeybill,11/27/2021,1,More important than any of this you want a fiduciary.  My MIL used her good ol boy financial adviser (actually an accountant for a local business) who is not a fiduciary but lived through all of those events (and more 70s gas crisis etc).  Eventually they figured out he was really just gambling with their money - they had no stability in growth toplines fluctuated like crazy and just last year they finally fired him after a $30k investment went bust.  Some young guy will have an education about those events that many who lived through them will not.  Its not necessarily a disadvantage objectivity is hard if you lost the farm in the dot com bubble.  In the financial world as in medicine it is not a bad idea to seek a second opinion and you cannot necessarily judge a book by its cover.
hmcpsqx,Rainbow-Death,11/27/2021,1,Well the thing is that I moved to Missouri and I’m no longer in the area which is why I’m asking Cigna for help but I don’t know how to get a hold of anyone there via the phone.

If you can’t you can get stuck in a bad situation you can’t leave because you can’t support yourself.  I assume this is what your sister was talking about.

hma88xi,wild_b_cat,11/27/2021,1,But those companies are already in VTI. And they have no history of over-performing the rest of the market (although this point is arguable there are a lot of ways to slice the data). So theres no particular reason to overweight them especially in a long-term portfolio.

hmc8b79,Impossible-3006,11/27/2021,1,I that might be the issue they realized what theyre paying on their current funds
hmbj7qt,Unable-Paper-1996,11/27/2021,1,Also for consideration regardless of how the match is set up the match is based on the salary you actually receive during the plan year (and then resets when the new year starts).  So even if you accepted a job where you make a $100k annual salary if you start on October 1 you actually only actually received $25k for this plan year (estimated for ease of math).  So starting next year you will be eligible for up to $4000 in match but for the plan year when you first started  you would only be eligible for $1000 (4% of $25k).   Hopefully that helps you out :)
hmbrbar,LaughingIshikawa,11/27/2021,1,... wait so youre using your credit card... To buy something on credit? (Thats what a payment plan is.)  Why use both forms of credit?  Why not use just one or the other (ie $70 a month cash or debit or $1200 credit?)
hmavusy,Anonymoose2021,11/27/2021,1,The multiple countries complicates matters but you have a few general possibilities to consider and review for each country.    One general strategy is to hold and invest the funds yourself and gift them to the children when appropriate.  To cover the possibility of your death before they are adults you would mention these accounts in your will and/or have them designated as the beneficiaries of the account.  The second general strategy is to gift to the children via their parents who would then manage and disburse them as they see appropriate.   The attractiveness of this approach is dependent upon the trustworthiness of the parents.  In the US and perhaps other countries there are custodial accounts.   Your nephews and nieces would be the beneficiaries.  The custodian or trustee might be either you or their parents.   These are effectively predetermined trusts with predetermined rules set down in law or regulations rather than being determined by specific trust documents.    Custodial accounts at banks generally have very low returns so you should look for brokerage companies that allow custodial accounts.   Be sure to understand the tax implications.  A trust is a legal document setting out the responsibilities of a trustee that manages assets on behalf of another the beneficiary.   The trustee could be a person or an institution.   The costs of a trust both the initial setup and continuing expenses make them most suitable for larger amounts than you plan to gift.  How trusts get treated and taxed varies widely between countries.   UK for example has well defined long established rules and laws regarding trusts while France only really recognized trusts in the last decade or two.  I know the above isnt a direct answer to your question but hopefully it gives a general overview of what to be looking at.
hmctxqm,RidgeCrenshaw,11/27/2021,1,Car sales person here.   Call the local dealer that matches the brand of car you drive. Bring it in for an appraisal.  Leave. Come back and let them know that carvana/CarMax/whatever company is local is willing to offer $XXXXX for it and see if it will pay off your loan and hopefully put some money in your pocket.   Used cars just like new cars are worth ALL the money right now.
hma9ols,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,Why were you leaving in the first place? Does the new offer address the reason? If so where will you be most securely employed be happiest and be the most intellectually fed?   Answer these questions and you may discover your own solution.
hmd8e5o,Jtherabbit21,11/27/2021,1,Slightly unrelated but make sure you’re actually seeing a physician (MD/DO) for your primary care checkups. They tend to do less unnecessary procedures and will end up costing you less.
hmc2wln,j-christopher,11/27/2021,1,What is important to you in a bank account?  I was reminded today that after banking with Wells Fargo for 22 years my daily ACH limit and mobile deposit limit are $5000.  Since these limits make the account effectively unusable as a household checking account Ive been diligent in checking on these types of limits when Ive opened subsequent accounts elsewhere.  I know this doesnt address your question about PNC directly but think more about how you  personally use banking services and what limitations youve encountered before.  Lots of people rave about their banks mobile app but Ill instead take a bank with a shitty app but a $100000 monthly mobile deposit limit any day of the week.
hmc88qo,dequeued,11/27/2021,1,Okay thats good. E-Trade is one of the few non-Vanguard brokerages that offers a good number of Vanguard mutual funds without any commissions (and some Schwab mutual funds too). I just wanted to make sure you werent paying fees to buy those funds.
hm9plnv,TomorrowIllBeYou,11/27/2021,2,Im making an educated guess based off of their post and their reply below.
hmbhob6,BeetsbySasha,11/27/2021,1,Oh definitely! I’m glad I bought before this boom. Certain improvements were known like we had old windows that we are finally getting around to replacing.
hmbukpg,hmspain,11/27/2021,1,Just my two cents but dont invest in a home.  A home is where you live.  Dont buy more than you can afford and buy something that is comfortable for you.  Investments are something entirely different IMHO.
hmcgmpc,throwawy12347,11/27/2021,1,2 dollars more an hour comes out to 4k more per year. It may not be a lot but it is something. How old are your kids? When will they be in school full-time and you can cut down on daycare costs?
hmav2l7,DonaldKey,11/27/2021,1,I ran into this issue recently. Withdrawing $4k. They said it’s because they only keep so much money in the branch at a time and I would be taking a big chunk of it so they couldn’t give smaller amounts to other people.   They were nice but asked that if I wanted a larger withdrawal to ask them so they could order more money for me.
hmbtki9,TBoneBaggetteBaggins,11/27/2021,1,Sell half of what you are considering now and hedge.
hmcjzzd,BlazeTurtleZ,11/27/2021,1,My only understanding of this situation is that if you became the victim of fraud the bank would close down your CARD—not bank account—and then send you a new one and refund the money?   It depends on the type of fraudulent charges if your debit card has fraudulent charges they would just deactivate the card if they are ACH payments (require your full account # and banks public routing #) they might close the account down to stop further charges making the account further negative.  My best advice is for your dad. the account owner to call or sit down with someone from the bank. theres almost nothing Wells Fargo will be able to tell you about the account in question unless you are on it could just sit next to dad at the bank or on the phone too.
hmap9ek,ronnevee,11/27/2021,1,The fun with the fica tax calculation is if you make over 142k a year the SS portion phases out but then there is also the additional Medicare part that starts around 200k. Are you wanting to know exactly your tax liability? Or get just a pretty close idea?
hmcla8p,Hushex,11/27/2021,1,Ill do what I must given the path to the result I want.
hmc0rxt,MovieJunior,11/27/2021,1,Im a little confused. Are you trying to move out on your own?? Or just moving places with family.   If its the latter you can rent a similarly priced place but that should go without question as you can assumedly  afford the place you have.   Buying is out of the question though on your wages without a sizable down payment.
hmb9zpo,wild_b_cat,11/27/2021,1,I bonds are good when you have medium term investing horizons. The 1 year lock up makes them a poor choice for money you might need in the near future but the long term returns aren’t as good as general market investments.   I think they’re most appealing for people trying to preserve capital for a purchase in the coming years or people trying to build up a cash position for retirement stuff like that.
hmbtm2n,sonnyfab,11/27/2021,1,Have you read the FAQ?
hmbqdop,Schreindogg,11/27/2021,1,It may have a minimum use requirement which they could charge you for if its not met each month? Not always the case but I have seen it before. I wouldnt just go signing up for everything read the terms and conditions carefully. Those credit card companies are in it for the money never forget that.
hma2m7e,aaaaij,11/27/2021,1,They are not very tax-efficient. You pay taxes on the dividend the year that it is earned even if it gets re-invested.

hmbma37,Billsrealaccount,11/27/2021,1,Well crypto currently has near zero utility besides being used as place to store real money.  It has yet to be adopted as a currency for anything that matters.
hmafuqw,Altruistic_Profile96,11/27/2021,1,I’m a big fan of Credit Unions as well.  USAA’s fraud unit is tops.  A few years ago I had $8500 taken from my checking account as somebody apparently cloned my Debit card.   I watched them via alerts as they drove from Miami to Lauderdale hitting a particular bank’s ATMs and a grocery store chain. The card was a chip and pin but the ATMs were mag stripe only.  I live nowhere near either city and only used my debit card at two Chip and Pin ATMs near me never for purchases.  USAA got it all back.
hmav4rn,93195,11/27/2021,1,I use my credit card for everything I can to get the rewards.  I typically pay a round number every week or so.  Whenever I think about it.  Whether my current balance is $487.57 or $524.14 I’ll just send $500.  If you’re doing that weekly-ish and using it a lot it really doesn’t matter what your statement balance is.
hma8y5k,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,> you should pay extra toward principal each month to own the house faster  Interest on a mortgage is ~2.5-3% right now. Paying extra on principle makes sense if you cant find a 20+ year investment that beats 2.5-3%. OP still has room in 401k/IRA so their gains will be compounded tax free.
hmc79nn,sfratini,11/27/2021,1,Usually what I do is that I don’t use my full salary increase to improve my cost of life.  Let’s say I get a 20% salary increase I would dedicate 5-10% into my quality of life and use the rest for long term investments.   I also feel like a hit a mark where I don’t really need much more. I have an apartment and a car. Both paid. No debts. My quality of life is vacations going out and the ocasional electronics purchase (a new tablet for example)
hmbf8p1,phrenic22,11/27/2021,1,How do you feel about taking a loan against your portfolio? If you transfer your stocks (ACATS transfer not sell and rebuy) to interactive brokers you can take out a margin loan for ~1.6%. keep in mind theres risks of getting margin called in a severe downturn. But you wouldnt have to sell anything in the interim.
hmbm0k9,harrisc42,11/27/2021,1,The easiest way for you to avoid a penalty is to make sure that your withholding & payments are at least equal to 100% of your taxes owed last year (or 110% if your AGI is $150K or higher).
hmbznvt,KReddit934,11/27/2021,1,So if I do make a payment I just need to get to that 100% number...that would give me an easier target.
hma03yj,Inevitable_Welcome23,11/27/2021,1,Do not pull from your retirement account for a house.  You are robbing your future self of the cost of that entire house in compound interest gain that would be tax free gain inside your roth 401k over the next 20-30 years. Just sell the stocks for the down payment as you can always buy more stocks in the future. You cannot add money back in to your roth 401k after it is withdrawn.   The loan looks nice but it isn’t. It creates a monthly payment that is disguised as cutting your tax free retirement contributions/gains over 5 years. Don’t do it. But you pay the interest to yourself right?? Yes but the 2-4% interest you pay yourself is not the 7-10% you would be getting in the market. Combine that with reduced overall roth 401k contributions and the risk of a huge tax bill if you lose your job or take a higher paying new job and your 35k down payment turns into a 150k+ net worth hit.   I would never be willing to take on a loan that locks me in to a set company for the next 5 years for a 5-8% interest rate and a ~30% tax penalty on the remaining unpaid balance to drop the loan or to avoid the penalty an instant payoff of the remaining balance if I accept a higher paying job at a different company or get laid off. It’s too much extra strings and stress when I could just sell stocks and not have a loan.
hmchvp8,Elegeios,11/27/2021,1,The thing costs $1200.  You buy with with your Amazon card and select the pay over time method.  Depending on the details youll get 0% financing for the purchase.   Youll see the full balance - $1200 - on your statement but you wont pay any interest on it so long as you make the payments.  The payments are apparently $70 a month. Is that for 18 months? 12 months?  Fast forward 6 or 12 or 18 months you sure as shit better make sure the card is paid off *with a month to spare* or youll get ravaged by what is probably 20%+ APR.  Make sure you do the math and ensure that your monthly payment has you cleared of debt *before the last month*.
hma9gzn,Ecstatic_Assumption5,11/27/2021,1,It’s infuriating these people making money like this when one has bills to pay Im having this big medical procedure that could save my life in less than a year and this people will probably use the money to buy useless stuff
hmb9laj,baudinl,11/27/2021,1,The key is to have the money go straight to somewhere other than your checking account. You may want to consider contributing more to your 401k (5% isnt very much)
hmalmqs,HandyManPat,11/27/2021,1,Note that the hit will also include missing out on decades of future growth towards retirement. Thats hard to fully appreciate when young but retirement age tends to sneak up on a person speaking from personal experience.  My guidance is to complete the indirect rollover of the **entire** amount to your new employers 401k if allowed or to a personal IRA.
hma885g,Pezpal,11/27/2021,1,The best advice I can give you is to use a reputable brokerage firm that charges a fee. If it’s free you’re the product not the consumer. For example don’t use Robinhood.  Use Charles Schwab or a company like it where they have a fiduciary responsibility to the investor.
hmcs82r,samicballs,11/27/2021,1,I know thats why I want to start new by selling. when i have my new portfolio thats when ill stay the course
hmbhhtj,BeetsbySasha,11/27/2021,1,Yes. It needs to be in a good range. I’m overall happy with what I bought but I recognize that we could have increased our budget. Now we just spend our house money on renovating slowly.
hmahmhu,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,IF you make less than $53K/year then Roth IRA is logical. Above that a traditional IRA may make more sense.   As for a 403(b) paying below inflation put your money elsewhere.
hmd4rvu,BeardedSquirrel94,11/27/2021,1,Unfortunately I don’t think these sites are able to keep up with some especially volatile markets not since the start of the pandemic.

hmb9eza,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,Something sounds wrong with your meter. Average American home uses 893 kWh per month. A $690 electric bill does not sound correct for a 2BR apartment.
hmcsqfh,cremedelapoo,11/27/2021,1,The tax consequences is only if you want to contribute to your rollover turned traditional IRA right?  What if you open a new tradition ira outside the rollover and isolate your contributions and conversion to only that new account
hmbzlf0,mocha47,11/27/2021,1,Their mobile app sucks.  It’s difficult to do some basics.  Their site requires too many clicks to view my accounts and make payments.  They need to spend some money on digital experience
hm9x077,strsystem,11/27/2021,1,Your dad isn’t giving you bad financial advice. Mathematically in terms of largest return hitting match is best but you increase your risk of basically becoming homeless with your 1.5k in savings. You’d have to move back home in order to support yourself if you lose your job or something else happens that wipes out your savings.   Some people are saying to put it in 401k and then loan against it in an emergency. That’s bad because you have to pay it back at a high interest rate. Even if it’s paying it back to yourself you don’t want to put yourself in a stretched situation where you might have to pay a penalty if you can’t pay it back. Sometimes you don’t have to pay it back but depending on the reason why you loaned it.   At the end of the day we’re talking about a few months to build your emergency fund. After you build it up you can continue to invest up to your match. I think the people that say invest to the match are thinking that you can depend on your parents if things go wrong to financially support you and help you get back on your feet. That’s not wrong but it really depends on whether you want to put yourself and your parents in that situation. In my opinion learning/trying to be self sustaining is the more responsible thing to do despite it not being the giving you the max financial ROI. This is probably what your dad is thinking as well. I’d have a different opinion if you had 6 months emergency fund already or if you lived with your parents and they like you there.
hmawtz9,UMfan11244,11/27/2021,1,My source: I received the bill.   Second source: my buddy owns a towing company and tells me of the shenanigans.
hmc73tv,No-Quiet2320,11/27/2021,1,Looking back from the age of 71 and currently living on my 401k (now a rollover) Im very glad I maxed out my contribution. Life throws so many curves at you--the fact that I have this retirement cushion (compounding is a miraculous thing) keeps me sane. But no doubt your dad is smarter than I am but my steady deductions turned into a suitable next egg.
hm8uccl,NVPcMan,11/27/2021,-1,If you really want it in their name 1099 your kid 6k open Roth IRA for them and deposit all earnings file a 1040 for them?  Simplify the process and just invest in a brokerage account for them.
hmc6ezd,mm172,11/27/2021,1,With nonprofits when they tell you the salary that tends to be the salary.  *Maybe* they’ll be willing to go a bit beyond the range for a senior level role or something like IT where you could definitely be earning more in the private sector or if they need a truly specialized skill set but for marketing when they’ve already got a team in place?  Probably a take it or leave it proposition.  I’d also say stay or at least keep looking if I were you OP.  I don’t think you’d be getting offered training if they wanted to push you out.  And in my experience “less responsibility” doesn’t mean less work in a nonprofit setting it just means it’s a lot harder to make the case that you getting an assistant should be enough of a priority to find room in the budget for it if the role expands beyond what you can handle on your own.
hmbfjce,joemetarei,11/27/2021,1,Sell it back sounds like it’s a car you couldn’t afford then and you certainly can’t afford it now.

hmct1id,zhentarim_agent,11/27/2021,1,It sounds like you might really benefit from therapy tbh. Youre denying yourself all happiness and joy in the present for a hypothetical future despite a pretty high income.    I live in a HCOL city (Los Angeles) but I budget and give myself the ability to enjoy myself.     You never know when life will go down the shitter so I think its important to enjoy your life while you still have (presumably) good health and your youth on your side.
hmb7yc1,mrisuckwithmoney,11/27/2021,1,I agree it’s just really difficult to do since these are now habits I have.
hmab3i4,ahas-dubar,11/27/2021,1,this really depends on the amount of money youre talking about.  if its a few hundred bucks a year just open some side accounts in your names and name each as the beneficiary. let it grow and gift it to them when you want them to have it. you can even gift the funds in kind so the tax consequences will be their responsibility not yours.  if youre maxing the annual exclusion amount ($15k from you $15k from your spouse per year per child - so $60k per year in gifts) then its time to talk about setting up trusts.

It’s definitely limited with regard to the number of options you can invest in but every fund available there is what you need to to have a simple and balanced portfolio.   TSP 401K Roth and Traditional IRAs are all essentially the same thing… tax advantaged retirement accounts where you can invest in stocks and bonds. They differ generally by when you get taxed who provides/ sponsors it how much you can contribute to each account per year and what options are available to invest in.
hmdar2l,m8adam,11/27/2021,1,Get a job in the trades. Electricians or plumbers apprentice and you will be making bank in 4 or 5 years.

If a small balance on a *secured* Discover caused a 25 point adjustment you are going to have a hard time securing a mortgage unless you have the traditional 20% down or something like VA backing.  As for the rest whats your overall score and do you know what score type it is?  What other types of accounts do you have (eg youve noted you have a secured revolving line of credit.  Do you have a car note student loans other unsecured lines?)  This is important because a single line of credit wont be sufficient.  Either way good luck.

hm96sxo,vgacolor,11/27/2021,5,This is difficult to advice on because we are really looking at a decision that has several components. The first one has to do with your desire to change careers. The second one is the financial impact. There are others such as cost of the education ability to get a job in the new field expected progression in your new field etc.      So lets talk mostly finance impact. At first glance it does seem like an expensive proposition. Lets assume you will need 3 years total to get a bachelors in Computer Science. Even pairing down your expenses We are talking about $100000 with in-state tuition and you will be 46 and a newly graduated CS major competing with 23 year olds.    So quick question about this CS career you want to have? What is the salary you expect? What do you want to be doing? Have you researched salaries out of college and within five ten years of experience. Will your marketability be impacted as a 50 year old with four years of experience competing with 27 year olds with four years of experience for the same job.    I dont want to throw cold water on the whole thing just want to make sure that you look at the possible downsides. You can easily be 46 with half of your retirement savings gone in 3 years.
hma8k13,lost_in_life_34,11/27/2021,1,Try to pay off as much credit cards as you can by March and it will raise your score.

hmbwefg,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,You dont need to *max* retirement but you should be saving sufficiently for retirement before contributing to a 529.    403bs tend to have poor fund choices high fees and could have an early withdrawal penalty if used to pay for college
hmb7y2u,Late-FIRE-,11/27/2021,1,I had this happen when I used to auto pay my landlord from Chase. After landlord mysteriously didnt get paid twice I quit auto pay and sent checks manually. I called Chase and got my money back to my account each time they were able to tell me it wasnt deposited and return it something about putting a stop on the check.
hmbxnvx,OneMoreCookie,11/27/2021,1,Depends if you want to buy a house and have kids. Otherwise day to day financially it’s no different to living with them unmarried. If you can afford to live together and can afford to do the paperwork for marriage then you can afford to get married. Does that make sense?   If you want to have kids then that’s a different set of financial requirements to work out will one of you stay home for a while? Maternity benefits? Cost of childcare vs wages plus all the other stuff like feeding and housing a child. Similar with buying a house emergency repairs general maintenance fees and rates and what happens if one of you looses their job.
hmcagc2,Altofin,11/27/2021,1,Boss seeing your resume does not matter.  Its not clear to me in your post what your actual goal is.  Do you want a different role?  Do you want to work for a larger marketing department?  Focus on your goal.  5% pay cut is not a lot if it helps grow you career-wise.  In this market they may even be willing to match or beat your current pay by \~10% your pay if you ask.  However be ready to accept the offer if you do ask.  Your current employer wants to keep you.  That is why your boss is offering options.  If you like your current job you could even use this as an opening to ask for more pay if that is your ultimate goal.

hmbd5sv,GleamLaw,11/27/2021,1,What is the point of money if you can’t spend it on things that matter to you? What’s the point then? A friend taught this to me and I now balance money with life. And it’s a much better life.
hmaanoa,MDfoodie,11/27/2021,1,Yeah I think $28k annually on food is high.  Whether or not that cost is acceptable to you is a personal decision based on your financial goals and your ability to afford it.
hmb6xjl,Interested_Redditor,11/27/2021,1,Not really. Getting above 800 is usually a function of time not of having more credit making devices.  No need to be over 800 for the best rates.
hmb8e5u,Topher_86,11/27/2021,1,It’s not expensive— just risky.  I would see marrying that young as a financial risk. Brain development continues to around age 25 or so tying financially to another person before this point could be disastrous as there is ample room in the development window for a person to change. Upsides are minimal as at such a young age the majority of people will likely have few assets if not in debt already.  It’s a reasonable conclusion to think the most someone will take on is the others’ debts at such a young age. Essentially the risk-vs-reward isn’t there.
hmcazf5,Sharpevil,11/27/2021,1,The more you keep in control of your finances and are able to direct your funds to exciting places the more excited you will be about budgeting. Let it slip and start spending more money than you have and budgeting will become a chore or even frightening. Sounds like youre on the right track.

hmctwbx,shipwreck17,11/27/2021,1,Ive never tried to do it intentionally. But have cashed in points and paid my balance causing it to temporarily go negative. A retured purchase could also do it.
hmaggx0,AJimJimJim,11/27/2021,1,+1 from someone who dated his wife since high school but got married at 28. There are some tax advantages to marriage if you dont make similar incomes but otherwise really no reason to rush in to it straight out of college IMO.
hmcxixe,sasafracas,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the answer.  I was hoping there was a reason for the 300 but just cause works for me!
hmcnugt,AbdominalSandman,11/27/2021,1,Yes it does. If it were mine i would call that company and ask for an increase to a max that will make your utilization into something 30% or lower.
hmauad5,Lollc,11/27/2021,1,He totally has way more of an emergency fund than I and most of my peers had.  But its not under his control.  He could be cut off tomorrow for any reason or no reason.  Ive seen it happen IRL.
hmcch8u,YeOldeBilk,11/27/2021,1,Dude I still dont see how most people could even afford to be single these days.
hmckbkk,Learn_Finance,11/27/2021,1,Thats what I am planning to do. From my understanding once you sell these you can transfer money to your checking within a couple day. But you are not allowed to sell I Bonds for 12 months from the time you buy them.
hmbl96l,Stoic_Chief,11/27/2021,1,Yeah that seems to be the strategy. Fortunately I just discovered that there are some apartments in my area that will give me discounts on rent since they are partnered with my employer. From what Ive seen I might not pay what I was paying before but I can save at least $100 dollars off my rent.

hmby21l,tstill_,11/27/2021,1,I dont read that at all with them burning OP with a the prospective employer?  It seems like the boss is doing their job and trying to get a replacement ready/trained by OP before they leave.
hmavym9,ThanksSoMuchTangelos,11/27/2021,1,Right - but also good to know that those kinds of zones exist. Will have to look into that later down the line.
hmcljc9,NotSoSmartChick,11/27/2021,1,I got my money by marrying it I was never career driven.  However I remember being broke as a joke thinking of all the cool things I’d buy if only I could afford it.  Fast forward to now and I HATE shopping.  I walk through a store and can literally buy everything in sight and it does nothing for me.    So yeah sometimes I miss the days of scrounging change to get a couple of 59 cent tacos at Taco Bell and trying to strike gold at Goodwill.  Now I fill my days with social activities leisure and travel.  In fact I’m flying to South America in the morning.
hmcoz1v,Synaps4,11/27/2021,1,If you are active trading the people youre trading against have $10000-a-year newsfeeds and they send people to check on how full warehouses are or how many ships are sitting in the harbor in portugal.   How are you going to compete with that by switching from FT to the Wall Street Journal or whatever?  Youre not.
hm919j5,Tinastar4u,11/27/2021,17,Why did he feel he could be so cavalier with you? Do u often go to this same teller? Are you friends? REGARDLESS .. this is wrong on so many levels and u need to be the one who puts an end to it. U need to report this. Dont ever feel blackmailed or that you have to do this. Save all messages and report this person
hmckqqf,DirtyDanChicago,11/27/2021,1,I applied for a job at NetherRealm on LinkedIn in. Told my friends about how it was fishy they wanted an interview so fast and that the email was odd considering they have their own domain. We knew someone who works there he said it was fake and they got it taken down.
hmcks14,norcalsocial,11/27/2021,1,Agreed. The actual profit will be less but without I am worried that without sales invoice all we have got are a bunch of paypal transactions. I am not sure if IRS would accept that.
hm8vzno,ZenGuruji,11/27/2021,2,If your ultimate goal is only 1M excluding retirement then why take on these rental properties?  If you are both living off of your husbands income (60k) putting your 120k into savings/investments then cant you achieve 1M via an ETF or mutual fund in 7-8 years? Even if you put 20k into savings per year (until you reach 1 year COL) and put the remaining 100k into ETFs/mutual funds you will still reach this goal excluding retirement.  You could then use a percentage of that for passive income from the market instead of all the headaches that come from rentals.
hmcogmo,SubaWho1337,11/27/2021,1,This is true. I see your point for interest being irrelevent depending on speed. Id guesstimate that I can pay an additional $500 or so dollars per month on top of the $1200 due monthly if I really stick to it. However Ive been floating along paying the minimum because its locked in and I really enjoy investing (stocks options crypto) as a hobby which I know arguably the loan being paid off is more important and also yields a 14.99% return guaranteed due to the APR..but...gratification and the market has been so hot this year it would have felt criminal to not put my feet in at least a little bit!
hmbk5u9,ScaldingHotSoup,11/27/2021,1,Nature conservancy does this kind of thing right?
hmappwy,bmoreboy410,11/27/2021,1,Yeah. Doing everything like your married without the marriage makes no sense.
hmavygm,DG_momma2,11/27/2021,1,This is pretty standard for most banks both for the cash withdrawal and the check.
hmbgzzf,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,This is probably the option that would best fit what youre trying to accomplish.
hmc4jjj,playdateslevi,11/27/2021,1,Getting married is not expensive and weddings even great ones don’t have to be. But I would HIGHLY recommend not combining your finances fully.   I’d determine how much you need for rent bills groceries dates/couple activities and other joint expenses and both pay into that fund as well as joint savings for larger expenses down the line like vacations and housing.   Having individual financial accounts allows for a degree of healthy privacy/individualism but paying into a shared fund still allows for a healthy degree of accountability.
hmbt2au,MangeLeBebe,11/27/2021,1,BMW does not currently allow 3rd party buyouts on their leased vehicles. Many captive lenders started disallowing this earlier in the year to help their manufacturers maintain revenue streams while their new car inventory dried up.  This means you cant just sell the car or trade it in like you can do with a traditionally financed vehicle.
hmbrh4i,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,Use the calculator again at the beginning of 2022 and adjust your W-4s at that point.
hm8vqm2,Frankwillie87,11/27/2021,4,The way banks do debits and credits on your bank statement is from *the banks* point of view of your cash. They are entirely backwards from the rest of the financial world.  For you personally if the cash leaves your account you credit cash and debit rent expense in this example.  Assets and Expenses have a normal debit balance.  Revenues Liabilities and Equity have a normal credit balance.  Thats why Assets + Expenses = Revenues + Liabilities + Equity in double-entry accounting. If the asset (cash) goes down it is credited and something else (rent expense) is debited.
hmd0zq2,samudrin,11/27/2021,1,Why do you think you can beat the market?
hm9wctt,Orangesunset98,11/27/2021,1,If the reason you wanted to leave is due to something mental (i.e. burnout bullying impostor syndrome) I personally wouldnt stay but if it was because lack of growth well you were certainly just offered some!
hmcgct7,jennystonermeyer,11/27/2021,1,You must not be in .com land.  This is a huge misconception.  And yes they do look at more but only at the time requested.  Read your fine print.  Ive bought a lot of houses with many title companies.  Most people just sign and never read   Bottom line read it its not what you think.
hmcc4jk,derWintersenkommt,11/27/2021,1,You sweet sweet summer child...
hmb3udu,Redcorns,11/27/2021,1,Call your local land trust (Northeast Wisconsin Land Trust is one) and talk to them about donating it. They’ll cover all the legal fees etc and you’ll get a tax deduction in the year the deal closes which will probably be tax year 2022 at this point.
hmb4ks1,Quality_Manager,11/27/2021,1,I think that’s what they are actually talking about. So they would just buy another commercial property with their entire sale or just the amount that was taxed (1 million)?
hmba4d0,WafflingToast,11/27/2021,1,You can trade by yourself on the JP Morgan platform you dont have to use the wealth advisory services.
hmc0djq,RawTack,11/27/2021,1,I’d say a lot of people have thousands in student debt before they buy a house and throwing money away on rent is pretty disadvantageous so I say yea buy the house
hmaco4l,twilightmarchon,11/27/2021,1,I wouldn’t necessarily listen to the above advice. Target date funds begin to limit risk as you approach retirement age. This reduces potential reward (so you might not make as much with the money) but makes sure you don’t lose everything if there’s a crash right when you retire. You need to carefully consider your risk tolerance before making this change. That said you have 17 years before you intend to retire so have some time for the market to rebound if it falls.
hmbnc1w,DestroyerOfIphone,11/27/2021,1,Sounds like youre in E heat or aux heat mode. Which uses coils like a space heater. This happened to me last year after a power outage my heat pump malfunctioned and my HVAC was stuck permanently in eheat.
hmcisga,jennystonermeyer,11/27/2021,1,Thats really bold of them.  Neat but probably based on initial purchase.  I have never ever seen a title company go out of escrow.  Ever.  You have a gem there for sure.
hmcfs65,vettewiz,11/27/2021,1,No…owners title insurance lasts as long as you or your heirs own the property.   And no they don’t just look for recorded liens. Title companies handle things like making sure water bills are paid in full property taxes are paid back to seller etc.
hmcsc34,Kashmir79,11/27/2021,1,Would you buy them today at their current price if you had cash instead? If not then sell reinvest in index funds and move on.
hmbrr2p,BigPharmaWorker,11/27/2021,1,How did your disabled and unemployed nephew even get to lease a vehicle much less a BMW costing $560/month?! What was he thinking? I mean who was he trying to impress.
hmbr52a,93195,11/27/2021,1,The full $1200.  The payments on that $1200 are $70/mo.
hm8wrov,Ojntoast,11/27/2021,6,Having work for a bank for the last 13 years when I started we processed in a high low manner.  Which 100% is a leftover means of paying items from the days when checks were the primary method of payment.  Back then youd always want the bank to bounce your smaller checks and pay your larger checks just by default.   So when we changed to a time-based system it was interesting that we still were getting accused of specifically running debits to purposely charge people more fees because with a time-based system credits Post in time order not first like they do in a high low system.  Customers will always think that the bank is specifically doing things just to charge more fees when the reality is they have a posting process and if you abide by it youll never have a fee charged if you dont youll get a fee charged.  And it impacts different people differently because of their own habits.
hmcs6rg,1SecretUpvote,11/27/2021,1,Spending in three months? Hard to know timeline but maybe 10- 15k. Overall its going to be a good deal more than that though.  Ive only ever had to pay for a flight once it was allegiant. But we have plans for longer trips on bigger airlines in the semi near future. Nothing specific though. We dont currently stay in many hotels either but thats something that is flexible for us.
hmcxe70,Scarface74,11/27/2021,1,I agree with this with a twist. After going through your list. Save an extra 70% over what you need for your emergency fund in a taxable investment and put your entire emergency fund in an index fund?  Why 70%? The most an index fund has dropped is 59%. That means worse case if your investments drop 59% (1/.59 == .70) you still have your emergency fund and statistically you’ll come out ahead.
hmab4jt,PrincessPilar,11/27/2021,1,If she is going to Insure it under her policy you will need to transfer title/ownership to her.  If she ended up having an accident in a car she insured but does not legally own her insurance company could deny coverage due to her not having any insurable interest in the vehicle.  Can she pay the difference in premium to you if you just add her as a driver on your policy?
hmcezv0,spiteful-vengeance,11/27/2021,1,You should always be open to better opportunities.  Any boss that considers that a reason to get rid of you isnt really worth working for. Theyre going to hold you back for years.
hm8x7lr,cdurbin3,11/27/2021,894,This OP. Im an Internal Auditor for a bank. You need to report this asap. You can see if the bank has a way to report complaints on their website they probably do or call and try to talk to someone in the compliance department.
hmd1fkx,account030,11/27/2021,1,Sums it up nicely.
hmai6e0,listairee,11/27/2021,1,Set it up for conservation and restoration of natural land. If not donate or sell it to someone that does. I purchase lands for this very purpose.
hmc8ly1,nutoreddit,11/27/2021,1,Yep. No fees 😊
hmd7w15,janeusmaximus,11/27/2021,1,So I worked at a furniture store for years and it is possible the salesman was telling the truth. This happened once with a power reclining sofa for instance. Someone had tagged it with price for manual recliners accidentally. Could also easily happen if it’s a sectional with many pieces. Like someone could have listed price with one console instead of two or left arm facing chair versus left arm facing recliner. If it didn’t have recliners and wasn’t a sectional probably just a grab for your money.
hmcov3l,tadpole_in_sync,11/27/2021,1,A bunch of companies are jumping on metaverse bandwagon. I am pretty sure they need builders and architects. Google this and good luck
hmbru01,GummyRice1,11/27/2021,1,I’m a believer in growing net worth by buying a place rather than pissing it away to landlords.  Of course you’re still paying the bankers the worth of the house in interest over 30 years but one thing at a time.  Get the house and make your next plan after.
hmaumop,mideon2000,11/27/2021,1,No. Keep your car. You wont be able to afford anything but a piece of high mileage junk. You literally need a dependable car for work.
hmc335w,somms999,11/27/2021,1,My wife and I also bought a new construction (although its a condo not a house).  My mother in law was our realtor although shes very experienced.  Negotiated a ton of credits for us and also got the builder to gift us brand new top of the line refrigerator washer and dryer from the show house.  Also got them to waive our HOA fees for a year.
hma73dx,Loutro-Fift,11/27/2021,1,Do you have a budget? Using a budget as a tool can help you track spending. You will be more aware of your spending and can plan for large purchases.   I find it helps with knowing if I am on track.   Also give yourself a break. You just accomplished a goal. Take it easy and focus on the positive aspect of being out of debt. Worrying won’t accomplish anything. Take a deep breath and enjoy your debt free life
hmc5pjx,terpischore761,11/27/2021,1,I wouldn’t do it. Having a competent realtor who knows the area you’re buying is key.   Would having your MIL be unhappy suck..of course. It would also suck if you overpaid had your home buying process be a nightmare or get into legal trouble because you hired someone that didn’t know what they were doing.

hmbw8d4,lizgross144,11/27/2021,1,The financial aid office may have finally reported it after an audit or something. It’s not uncommon that you’d need to request in writing that the deferment be waived.
hmd6exm,dgnga,11/27/2021,1,PayPal reports revenue when it exceeds $20k or 200 transactions in a tax year. eBay reports it too.  So the IRS will know the income. You need documentation on what she spent to build her inventory + other business expenses. If she doesnt have receipts you still have a month to buy more inventory.   Best to see a tax accountant ASAP.

hm9rv4t,Mojang57,11/27/2021,1,With collection agencies send a certified letter asking for proof of the original  debt. By law Debt collectors must send you a written “validation notice” that states how much money you owe the name of the creditor and how to proceed if you want to dispute the debt. If they cannot provide this proof demand that they remove the debt from your credit reports. CC all three credit agencies.

hmc7wk6,NotQuiteGoodEnougher,11/27/2021,1,When youre tired of losing. Theres no guarantee that any stock will regain value.   Look at what youre buying. Over time major stocks tend to gain. If youre consistently investing in losers reevaluate your buying criteria.

hmckt0l,TA_sadandscared,11/27/2021,1,Thank you so much this is so helpful!!! If the amount is $900 do you think it will be easily resolved? I was thinking about contacting the collections agency and offering to pay if they erase the mark as I saw that might be a good idea on the wiki!
hmd87c0,MediumExplorer,11/27/2021,1,It’s not depreciating quite the opposite. Used teslas are going for more than new because people are impatient with the long wait times. Even a 2018 standard range (which would have costed $38k in 2018) went for $44k with 32k miles  Before the pandemic they also kept their value super well.

hmadzhc,Riza101z,11/27/2021,1,I understand we might wait longer to marry because he’d still be in college but we will probably still get married young.

hmc7i20,lucky_ducker,11/27/2021,1,You have unknowingly touched upon a divisive subject: should one invest in passive index funds to match market returns or should one invest in actively managed mutual funds hoping to *beat* market returns?  The consensus seems to be passive index investing because 90% of actively managed mutual funds dont beat their benchmark indexes. I believe in splitting the difference: roughly 90% of my portfolio is in an age-appropriate mix of index funds the remaining 10% in a couple of managed funds with phenomenal records - WAESX and WAGOX. Yes they have high expense ratios and are worth every penny.

It is definitely possible for accounts to be closed by the bank for fraud or for other reasons but that may (or may not) be what happened - its possible the bank just closed the account because it was overdrawn and sent it to a collection agency to recover the overdrawn amount.        To be perfectly honest this seems to be less of a financial issue at this point and more of a legal one.  As hard as it may seem to consider your father may no longer have enough faculties to control his own finances and may need a legal caregiver to take care of him.  If that is a path you or anyone in your family are interested in exploring then thats really beyond this sub and you would probably have to consult with a legal office that deals with custodial arrangements or guardianships and power of attorney for adult dependents to see what options are available.        It certainly is entirely possible that your fathers account was hacked and he lost a bunch of money.  But without being able to access the accounts and statements themselves and dig down into the details we can only speculate.  And there are also time limits to care for these issues so if this happened many months ago there may be limited (or no) options at this point.

hmcnjjc,dlpfc123,11/27/2021,1,Exact same boat. I hate that rent is the most you will ever pay statement because it is so not true. Homeowners have unexpected expenses yes. But renters have the expected expense of ever increasing rent prices. Not saying buying is for everyone but lets not lie about the inherent expenses of renting.

hmcb52e,runyoucleverboyrun,11/27/2021,1,Try asking for a raise at work you dont really have any leverage with your landlord and I doubt youll get another place with low enough rent to offset the cost of moving as rates are increasing across the board.  Edit: also try looking for a higher paying job switching jobs will usually pay more than getting a raise.

hmbmlqj,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1,No it really wont matter. At this point just open credit cards for bonuses or better rewards. Actually for a mortgage in the near future since presumably at 19 your credit history is not very long you should avoid opening any more new accounts.  If you have an existing Amex card you can ask them to double or triple your credit limit. They will not do hard pull. Also see if any of your other cards do increasess without hard pulls: https://www.doctorofcredit.com/credit-cards/which-credit-card-companies-do-a-hard-pull-for-a-credit-limit-increase/  Also keep in mind your *reported* credit card balance can have a large impact on your credit scores and mortgages use older FICO versions that are even more sensetive. For the best possible scores you want one card to report a small balance say $5 and the rest $0.

hmb4sjv,ChipsAndLime,11/27/2021,1,Sorry to hear that you’re struggling. Maybe not financially but you are struggling.  I don’t think that you’re completely unreasonable in some of this.  Like not wanting to blow all of your money on housing for example.  You definitely should be safe especially if you can afford it. But living below your means within reason is valuable too.  Also acne _might_ be more a product of what you’re eating plus whether you wash your face at least once a day and whether you keep your towels clean. Fancy skincare might be far less relevant than you think.  You might consider looking for a therapist to help you with some of this.  I suspect that maybe you don’t think so highly of yourself.   Maybe that’s partly because of how you’ve been treated in the past.  Either way that might make it seem fairly pointless to spend money on keeping your clothes looking good and other ways that you could take better care of yourself.  Listen you’re capable of being amazing and wanted by others.  Maybe you just need to get some help to see how that’s possible and what you can do to get yourself there.  I’ll bet that you’re closer than you think. You might just need a little help.

What I plan on becoming is a master electrician and starting an apprenticeship right out of high school this fall while keeping my part-time job as well. Both incomes I estimate will be $180000 over 4 years time before any expenses taxes and/or saving. The electrician thing will take me 5-6 years and if I were to start putting money away itd be $40-50/week.

hmd67pu,UGA10,11/27/2021,1,Usually when both partners in the marriage are high earners.  The 2017 tax reform law updates have narrowed those cases but its still possible.    The upper end of the 35% bracket and the 37% bracket could potentially bring the marriage tax penalty in to play.  That is where the tax brackets between single and married filing joint stop being double.
hmdbgwf,Chiggadup,11/27/2021,1,Can be both for sure. Im a public employee and my primary is a 403b. But accidentally contributed to a 457 for a couple months after a job change because paperwork is so similar.  Both are options though.
hmb6qff,ionlydrinkIPAs,11/27/2021,1,There is no benefit to having a score above 760 (or 740 depending on the lender) when it comes to getting a mortgage. You will be getting the exact same interest rate at 760 as you would at 800+.   And no a secured card isn’t going to improve your credit any faster than an unsecured card will. In fact the low limit on a secured card would be less beneficial than getting a larger limit (and better rewards/benefits) with an unsecured card.
hmc7egi,dequeued,11/27/2021,1,Tune out the noise. Youre not investing for a few weeks or months.
hmayswh,codemonkey14,11/27/2021,1,I was literally in the same situation as you a few years ago almost down to the exact numbers.    My advice: prioritize what is a lifestyle improvement you consider worth the money and also take a fixed % of each major income raise you have and use it as your increased savings and use the other for lifestyle enhancements.    For example let’s say you agree on a fixed 50% saving rate of any new income going forward from your previous income level. If you start taking home an extra $1000/mo put $500 of it towards savings and use $500 toward stuff that makes your life better (mortgage on a nicer house vacations eating out new gadgets etc). This in my experience has led to the most amount of having savings keep up with new income while still being able to enjoy the success I’ve had and not waste my life living without the things that I dreamed about when I wasn’t earning as much money as I am.
hmd6bye,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,1,Thank you and yeah im in the US.   Its almost as if they label it as “compounding interest” but in reality it simply means just not withdrawing funds or touching it for many years lol.   For short term savings would you rather save in an FDIC - insured savings account or an ETF through a brokerage?   I understand all gains are taxed but even after tax it grows more than just sitting in a bank.

hmclz4i,tacotruck2112,11/27/2021,1,This is mostly a question for Chase.  The agreement you signed with them almost certainly gives them the right to place a hold on deposits especially on large non-payroll items.
hm8vb41,doktorhladnjak,11/27/2021,1,It’s 22% on the first million for the year then 37% on everything above that.  However employers usually have the option of withholding for the bonus as if it were ordinary wages too in which case it almost certainly will be withheld at 37%. You’d need to ask the employer what they do and if they offer any options for the withholding (unlikely but possible).
hmce6ct,unrealJiminy,11/27/2021,1,Overpay the best underpay the worst pay the others roughly market. Everyone should do whats best for them and theyre families professionally (employer and employee regardless of size). If you cant overpay consider other incentives like time off or equity. The top 10% contributors make or break companies. Failure to effectively manage salaries has predictable results (bad employees staying good employees leaving)
hmb6w4s,atx78701,11/27/2021,1,what is safe? economists and financial advisors define risk as beta which is a measure of volatility. They would say high beta and high volatility is unsafe (risky).  I personally dont care about beta at all as Im in for the very long haul. Over a long enough time period (eg. 10 years) beta doesnt really matter.  Invest in americas best companies (eg S&P 500) and over the long term they will definitely grow and so will the value of their stocks.  To me putting money in a bank account is about as unsafe as you can be as you are guaranteed to lose money due to inflation but there is no volatility at all.  I personally would make sure that I had enough emergency funds in cash. The rest would go into VITAX (technology index fund).

hmc20s7,InigoMontoya757,11/27/2021,1,> I want to marry my bf when I get out of college I would be around 22F and he would be 21M.  This isnt a hard and fast rule but people commonly get married at an older age. I suggest cohabiting first. Hopefully you will find him to be a good partner. But its best to be sure.  > I’m wondering how marriage would change our finances. My sister thinks it would be expensive. We don’t plan on having an expensive wedding or expensive engagement ring.  Your plan is a good one IMO.  > Over talking we decided we would combine all our finances when we marry. Do you think this is a smart move financially and what changes would occur when we combine our finances as a married couple. I heard you get tax benefits for being married so would it be less expensive.  Not being American Im not qualified to talk about US taxes. (Im assuming youre American I could be wrong.)  But I would not totally combine finances. I think each of you should have your own checking account and a combined checking account for combined expenses. Each paycheck/direct deposit goes into your own account. Transfer enough money to pay for rent/mortgage and other shared expenses. You should each have your own credit card and perhaps be authorized users on each others account.  Why have your own account? So you can surprise your husband to be with a nice gift (and ditto for him). Or you can spend a bit of money on a hobby he thinks is silly (and ditto for him) without an argument. Or because someones account got frozen due to fraud or a bank screwup and now you have a backup. Or theres a death or divorce. You cant see the future so its best to have a backup that you hopefully will never need.  Sharing living expenses is in of itself a great cost savings regardless of the tax rules :)

Only the income in the new bracket is taxed at that new brackets rate. If you are $50 into the 22% bracket only $50 is taxed at 22%.

hmbkozy,BruceCourteous4444,11/27/2021,1,What’s the difference between ETF and Mutual Funds?
hma0jni,boolda,11/27/2021,1,1. No. The prediction tools are not accurate. Use a tool like portfolio visualizer to do a montecarlo simulation using your portfolio. This will give a range of value. You generally can expect to hit the median.  2.  You did not say who is your employer. The differed compensation plant is generally 457. If your employer is a state or federal government the account operates exactly like 401k with an option to take out the money if you leave your employer without any penalty.  About your child take an education loan below 4-5%. Pay only the interest. When you retire with 1.5M or so take the money out of your 457 and payoff the loan. Don’t worry about college expenses now.   In general at your age contribute as much pretax money as you can the. Fund a Roth IRA if you have left over money then save in brokerage account.   Don’t use target date funds don’t use bonds. Put everything you have in a SNP 500 or total market fund. In your case the fund selection will make or break your retirement. With proper fund selection you can surely have 1M or more at 65.
hmd9ath,_BreakingGood_,11/27/2021,1,Ive seen employers in my industry who will offer you can 8 weeks training course plus guaranteed job at the end but if you quit within the first 2 years you owe them something like $60k for the training (which could be had through alternative means for less than 5-6k.)

hmcocb7,1nd3x,11/27/2021,1,You could just roll your credit card debt into your Mortgage to lock it into a lower rate.  Theres always funny ways to make it work but for people who just want an idea of how it could happen while not strictly the only way(it actually decidedly wouldnt play out like this there are plenty of steps that happen that wouldnt actually happen(IE: If you owe me $5 and I owe the bank $5 you can just pay the bank the $5 if we all agree..I dont have to physically touch a $5 bill)  If you get pre-approved for a $500000 mortgage and you have $50000 in credit card debt.  Buying a $450000 house for $500000 with a $50000 cash back condition gives the home buyer $50k cash to do whatever the fuck they want with....to which you pay off your credit card.  Banks are aware of this play they will not trust you to actually pay it off and if you want to work with them sometimes you may even get pre-approved for a $550000 mortgage assuming youre gunna buy a home valued at $500000. so everyone involved comes out Ahead

You can put out a Craigslist ad and offer to auction off the hunting rights.

hma4u3a,altmud,11/27/2021,1,Equity participation of any kind (including RSUs) is inherently a gamble.  Thats the nature of them and everyone knows that.  I doubt youll get very far attempting to come up with some grand argument about how little they might worth.  This is no different than any other compensation negotiation.  Youre going to have to argue the great value you bring to the company or that you could get more somewhere else or how the offer is less than the going rate for someone of your experience in your position.  Things like that.  You can mention that the offered RSU amount isnt enough to compel you to join as part of that negotiation.  But I dont think focusing on doomsday events where the company is possibly going to fail and they will be worth little or nothing is going to be a very motivating argument (or endear you to them).

hmckjhq,HamletJSD,11/27/2021,1,Just adding on to the pile here: definitely make sure youre factoring all of this in... on both sides of the equation. I was ready to leave a job for another with basically equal pay (new position had much better work schedule and that was the most important thing to me at the time) but as I looked more closely I realized the benefits I was getting where I was were worth like $8000-10000 a year (extra weeks worth of paid vacation and sick time 401K matching etc).  Paying attention ahead of time meant that while I still left I had the leverage (and confidence) to ask for more money from the new company I was talking to. Ended up with a more equivalent overall package.

hmc5oaz,Ok_Anteater_7446,11/27/2021,1,Along with applying to be an RA you could apply to work at an off-campus student apartment complex. Im not sure if rent is free in that case but itd at the very least be reduced.  If you already know what program youre going into you could find scholarships that are specific to that from your school. (Ex: scholarships and grants specific to journalism if thats what youre working on) You would probably still need the FAFSA to be eligible but the applicant pool will be smaller.
hmbc4x4,frozeninjpthrowaway,11/27/2021,1,I would say what sets the first two apart is universality- my friend working in the UK doesnt have to worry if his bank supports Faster Payments or not they all just do. This is still an issue in the US with Zelle because its operated by a third party unconnected to the ACH operator and banks and credit unions have to apply to join with all the complexity that entails.  And the problem with Venmo and Paypal is that its only instant within the ecosystem- want your balance in your actual bank account? Youre beholden to ACH again.

Pay off the debt first. The quicker you pay that off the quicker youll stop being charged 7%. Thats a much better return on your money than saving it in a savings account earning less than 1%.  That said if your medical debt isnt being charged interest pay the minimum on that and pay off the CC debt ASAP. Then you can start saving for a house downpayment while paying off the rest of your medical debt.

hmd4cyf,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/27/2021,1,I think one way to look at this is it determine how much you want to save for a home.  2k a month is 24k a year verses almost 15k a year so if you wanted 100k so 4.1 years versus 6.6 years and a Tesla   (I’m sure you’ll make more money over time or you can be less aggressive with your investing but it’s one way to think about it)

hmcgkvn,TwoWrongsAreSoRight,11/27/2021,1,First look at your state laws and your closing documents to ensure nothing has snuck in or theres no loopholes.  The public utilities commission and whoever helped you close on your house should be able to help with this.  Truth is it will be less of a hassle to consider paying it temporarily as if they shut you off you will need to pay anyway + fees in the event you are found responsible for the bill.  However dont accept phone calls as proof of the bill and dont pay with a credit card.  Everything should be done by mail and check so there is an unbroken paper trail in the event this does reach a legal action stage.   Get the customer service phone number from the utilities website (or a state registry) call and inform them that your first day owning the property was Feb X 2021 and ask for a mailing address to overnight them proof if they are willing to accept it.  Ask them to mail you a bill from that date forward.       If they arent willing to give that to you your city/state should have a public utilities commission.  They should be your next call.  I assume you can provide proof of your first day owning the home.  Depending on the laws of your state and the terms of your closing that should be all they are allowed to charge.  If the public utilities commission isnt willing to help then its time to get the state attorney generals office involved and possibly seek out a lawyer.  This will be a long process if you have the utility company wont cooperate.  Good Luck
hmbqpec,Neighbor1973,11/27/2021,1,I recently did a refinance through Filo Mortgage and had a great experience.  Filo Mortgages rates were the lowest for my particular situation.  I think getting the lowest rate is the best approach as it will reduce your interest expense over the life of the loan.

The less information they provide you the greater the leverage for them. If you can provide details Id be happy to help. Im guessing they went over the money factor and residual with you? The good news is Hondas maintain their value so if the auto industry keeps trending the way it is you may be able to get out of your lease early and get another car that may be within the price point that is comfortable for you.
hmc3yui,TurkeyBLTSandwich,11/27/2021,1,So in my experience when I was asking for a pay bump during the shift to a new project. HR decided to chime in saying that my LinkedIn was set to open to new opportunities and I was grilled for like 10 minutes on why theyd waste time and money on a guy leaving I had to carefully explain that without a guarantee of being put in a new job id effectively have a 2 week buffer bench before being administratively let go.   They understood that but still didnt grant me my pay bump.

hmac1fn,MathAndCS_Nerd,11/27/2021,1,Ill let others that are more knowledgeable speak on best things for you to do but I can offer some basic definitions to get you rolling on your own research.  * 401k IRA ROTH traditional - these are terms meaning and/or generally used with retirement accounts. These would be accounts you add money to now but you dont access the money until youre retired.    * If you dont stay in the US this might not be something for you to care about. Or you might have a lot of fine print to read up on. Again others will have more knowledge on this. If your goal is to become a US citizen (or maybe even permanent resident?) and retire here in the US then these are things you would definitely want to learn about.    * Also if youre sticking around and becoming a citizen learn about our Social Security. There can be a lot of debates/discussions/etc about things with this but we do have a tax system everyone pays into that allows retired people (and permanently disabled people) to receive a monthly benefit check. It depends on how long youve paid into the system and how much youve earned. But again not a thing youd want to spend as much time on if youre not sticking around. * Savings - this is generally just your own cash on hand.    * HYSA - High Yield Savings Account - This is a bank account (like checking but instead called savings) that has a high interest rate compared to the market. Most people put their emergency fund and sink funds here.    * Emergency fund (EF) - This is cash quickly available (think: immediately or less than 2-3 days). This is cash set aside for nothing but emergencies. Usually people have X months of living expenses (X = 3 6 12 depends on who you ask). If your car breaks down you lose your job etc you want to not also have no money for food/rent/etc. This helps cushion any blow.    * Sink fund (SF) - This is saving up for a planned expense. Buying an expensive sofa going on vacation down payment for something like a house etc. Large planned expenses get put in their own bucket.    * Some people put more savings into things less quickly accessible like bonds CDs etc. They may consider this part of their EF or a SF but its understood this cash isnt immediately accessible or it is but with a fee. For example someone might have 3 months of their EF in a HYSA but then another 3 months in a CD. Or someone trying to buy a house but not for another couple years might put their SF in a bond.    * Anything other than those two are usually just savings and different people have different rules for their own accounts. But savings is rarely/never the same as the retirement accounts above since the retirement accounts are considered inaccessible until retirement while savings can be accessed at any time. * Brokerage accounts (aka securities accounts) - These are investment accounts for stocks bonds mutual funds and ETFs. This is separate from the others above typically. Although you also invest your retirement money so it grows as you work these are immediately(ish) accessible like savings.

hm9lpdw,my_new_throwaway106,11/27/2021,1,I totally get your anxiety.  I remember when I learned about the 30 year mortgage and I nearly fell out of my chair.  On the other hand by and large we can have a very high quality of life compared with most people who lived because we can borrow money which is basically signing away our future labor and income to buy something now but unlike a fancy car or a vacation this is something which will serve us well for many years and increase in value.   Ive also seen the opposite - folks who rent all their lives and then towards the end dont have any assets to show for it.  It isnt pretty and has far more anxiety than what you are probably feeling now.  The idea of borrowing money for 30 years is pretty intense.    Overall houses tend to appreciate so its both a place to live and an investment.  The good news is that the mortgage payment itself doesnt change (taxes and insurance and other stuff will increase over time though) so as your income (hopefully) increases and as inflation erodes the value of money in several years you will look at your mortgage compared to the then current rent and be extremely glad that you purchased.   With your income and the money you have you can likely get something very nice that will be good for the present and good for the future especially if you have in mind to have a family.  That of course is a very personal decision.  So if you get a family house now it will feel too big but if you get a one bedroom or something now just for you in some years it will feel very cramped.   You can do the math all over the place.  If you put more money down now you have a lower payment (good move).  If you put less money down now you have a higher payment but can keep that extra money in the investments.  For your own home in many places you can put like 5% down so thats 25K if youre talking about a 500K house.  Not bad really.  On the other hand you can have a lower payment if you put down 20% (or more).  The lower payment is nice for peace of mind regarding the future.    If you want a little motivator try to research home prices in your area in the past.  How have they fluctuated over the past 20 or 30 years.  Now think and realize that you are in the past and your future self and your kids will look back at the home prices now and be glad you bought.    Please trust us when we say that you are in a good spot financially.  Please trust yourself that you will have the continued earning power to be able to do this.    A little about me and my story.  I bought my first home in 2008 when I was 31.  I bought it for about $200K.  It is now worth $400K.   I have refinanced once and save on the monthly mortgage because of that.  I had to move and its rented out and has been so for some years.  So for the last several years someone else has paid the mortgage and we get a little income and the house has increased in value.  So all in all I have about $1M in houses and about $700K in loans giving me $300K in equity.    A few years ago I bought a second home a smaller townhome as an investment.  It was $200K (in a different market).  Again someone else is paying the mortgage I get a little income the house has appreciated about 50% in the last few years.    I bought a third home about a year ago and live in it.  Its $400K and I pay the mortgage.  It is also appreciating.  The neighborhood was built in 1994 and there are still original owners here.  Their monthly payment is stupid low because the houses were about $150K when they bought them. They raised their kids in the houses and now they are empty nesters.  They have a ton so equity (if they didt take out massive loans) and some just plan on staying here.     So for me a lot of it is a matter of faith and trust that you can continue to make the payments and the system we have remains solid.    Good luck

hm9fmsx,tjkul,11/27/2021,-2,Seem fair to me. Especially you get cash. But If you think you do more and not happy with the pay ask for increase. Question is: how much more you think you should get pay? It don’t hurt to ask. But pls know that this is also a tough time for everyone. Cost of good has gone up (some double) in everything and it hard for many business owner as well. Sometime people see the $$ and thought business owner making so much and why am I making so little but they actually don’t understand how much expense is each month.
hmc15pp,blipsman,11/27/2021,1,Use what you need and can pay off in full each month. Don’t worry about utilization as it’s determined each month. Over time you’ll get larger limit more cards and increase limit for utilization. If you’re not buying a car or house imminently it doesn’t matter now. Number of transactions makes no difference.

hmc58yu,moneypenny88,11/27/2021,1,Leave a balance of 1-5% of your total available credit. Basically to maximize your credit scores including mortgage scores you want to have one card with a balance of 1-5% and the rest zero. It’s called the AZEO method all zero except one.  Depending on your credit limits the higher the balance to limit ratio will lower your score and that starts at 6% and going over 30% lowers it much more. But reporting no balance on all cards will hurt more than a zero balance.   If you have months before you’ll buy you can play with the balances and see how it changes your score. Just fyi because it’s possible paying off the 7k could drop you below 750.

So even if OP contributes to a new traditional IRA the pro-rata taxation rule will take the rollover IRA money into account if it is not emptied out by either a reverse rollover into OPs 401k or conversion to Roth (and associated taxes paid).

hmcryvv,aflawinlogic,11/27/2021,1,You are completely wrong. A property can totally owe.  Its his problem because utility bills are often not charged to person but to the property and can be enforced with liens against that property so lesson learned always get final reads when transferring ownership and buyer beware from foreclosure sales.  Renter payment authorization is also an easy common thing but its always going to revert back to the current owner in case of non-payment.  The company doesnt know or care that a sale has occurred it isnt their problem they are still gonna collect.

hma83h4,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,As the (twist on) old saying goes: best time to start investment is 20 years ago. Second best time is today.   Despite my best intentions and plans I found myself in a fairly similar position at about the same age.   As you help her (as much as she will allow) remember that she isnt really investing for the short term. Yes she might be working past 67 thats 14 years from now. Beyond that is the rest of her life which has a statistically significant change of being to age 90 (better than 20%).    Even 14 years is what most financial advisors would deem long-term but with a life expectancy of 25-45 years *definitely* taking a long-term mindset is appropriate. She isnt planning on just getting *to* retirement she is planning for the rest of her life.  She has until April 15th (or when she files taxes) to make a contribution to an IRA for 2021 so it isnt necessary to put too much pressure to do something NOW. Also what she does over next decade+ is more important that what she does this very minute.    Sounds like your Mom has set a good example for you now you can do the same by starting your own retirement you can share what you learn back to her. How to read a statement how to track investments etc.

Do you find yourself longing for things or missing out on experiences that would bring you genuine joy because they are just out of your financial reach?  If not then just keep on keeping on.

hmcugns,keepngoal,11/27/2021,1,We filed separately last year and will file together more than likely for 2021.  We have used an accountant since 2012 and it has removed so much stress in our lives and we meet him once a year in July/August to review forecast.   It’s money well spent besides there might be past taxes owed to you.   My suggestion let the professionals handle it and that is a CPA.
hmcnazk,itsadesertplant,11/27/2021,1,I definitely recommend a password manager and a shared email for bills if you get married. I don’t know much about how finances themselves change- I’m not married- but I do know that it’s easier to get on one another’s health insurance if it’s provided by an employer.   I personally wouldn’t advocate for a joint account. Separate finances. If one party needs extra money/is doing the grocery shopping for both of you etc that person can have a particular credit card for that purpose or can have a specific amount transferred to them on a regular basis to a certain account and so on. You can split bills by having each of you pay certain ones.  However I think it’s ok to share an email account that is only for the bills (the email is linked to accounts for insurance electric internet etc) so either party can log in and see what’s going on. Having a joint account is one thing but communicating with each other about finances is another very important thing imo.   Having an email that both of us can access has helped me and my partner keep track of things while having our own bank accounts. We also have the Bitwarden open-source password manager which allows for sharing particular passwords without texting or handwriting it which is nice for dealing with numerous online bill pay services.
hmcbwti,newton302,11/27/2021,1,id take the free education and continue working for the higher wage with the possibility that your boss is planning to replace you and offer you a better role. Having worked in the nonprofit sector for over a decade I would not advise taking the other job especially in the current economy.

hmc8y1r,LilSpringChicken,11/27/2021,1,It seems like you should be filling together. Very rare to fill separately unless there is a student loan situation with one person. You could always have a CPA run it both ways and handle your taxes as you may want to itemize

hm9wezm,nothlit,11/27/2021,1,Employer retirement plans generally follow a [pro-rata distribution rule](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/rollovers-of-after-tax-contributions-in-retirement-plans). For example if your 401k consists of 60% pre-tax balance (pre-tax contributions or earnings of any type) and 40% after-tax contributions then 60% of any distribution would be taxable.  As discussed at the link above you can (currently) do a split rollover where the after-tax basis goes to a Roth IRA and the pre-tax amount goes to a traditional IRA. That allows you to eventually take tax-free withdrawals from the Roth IRA without having to touch the pre-tax portion in the traditional IRA until you actually want to. However Congress is currently considering banning Roth conversion of after-tax amounts so this option may be short-lived.
hmc74ni,loveittodeath,11/27/2021,1,Just paying all of the debt off is the better option. I never carry a balance on any of my cards. In fact theyre usually paid off before the statement even hits. My score is over 800. Paying credit card interest is never a good idea.

hmcubyf,UnknownLoser123,11/27/2021,1,There are fees for my debit cards such as international transaction fees... that I would like to avoid
hmcwkal,etblo,11/27/2021,1,Thats what i wouldve thought but the guy that fixed the leak took a glance at the meter and told me i should take a picture and email it to nyseg but i put it off and forgot the meter is in my basement and its pretty old so it couldnt have been read wirelessly or anything and no one ever has read it i sent pictures of it later (after this issue showed up) on cause one of the people from the company i talked to said it would help.   Whats odd too is that my usage at my home is very very low but my bills change drastically from month to month ive been curious that the meters might be bad
hmaxc52,rb1_man,11/27/2021,1,If you know how much you pay each month and you know how much you use each month it should be pretty easy to extrapolate your rate. Figure it out over a few months and see if the rate fluctuates or stays consistent.
hmctxz5,lieinfieldsofgold,11/27/2021,1,The JP Morgan robo advisor fee is 0.35% so you could always use that option.        I have a JP Morgan advisor and Im very happy. I pay less than 1% and the fee goes down as the balance increases.  My account was up just over 30% last year and is up about 20% this year. Not surprising given how the markets have done.  My advisor is a fiduciary and a certified financial planner.  He manages my Roth and 401K accounts. I also have a self-directed brokerage account which I manage myself. So you can do both if you want.        I know this sub hates on financial advisors but I have a comprehensive savings retirement and spending plan. It works for me.  I will be comfortably retired by age 60.
hm96uqk,islangmemes,11/27/2021,1,I would say you could maybe swing it if you were very conservative with your money but with such little in savings I’d say no in this case. 10k in savings will not get you far at all. Barely will cover your furniture costs. You would literally be house poor if you have nothing else besides the 10k (I know you have retirement funds but you should never take those into consideration for non-retirement purposes). I personally wouldn’t want a high payment and zero cash in reserves if something major happens like you unexpectedly lose your job. I’m sure you’re eager to get into a place to call your own but don’t rush into it and make a decision you later regret. Keep saving that savings account and you’ll be there soon enough.

hmbsxl9,sevoiso,11/27/2021,1,Ya. I agree usually
hmalnnp,sektrONE,11/27/2021,1,One thing I always emphasize to people is that when you buy a house as long as you’re accounting for the additional repairs utilities taxes etc. you also should remember that a portion of your payment is principal on your mortgage and growing your equity.  This means that at worst (assuming the market doesn’t tank) you’re effectively putting that portion into savings and at best it’s appreciating significantly. So it’s not all sunk costs like your rent.  I’m not saying to look at a personal residence as an investment just that your principal payment shouldn’t be looked at as a pure expense IMO.

hmcmxvk,NeonSoldier117,11/27/2021,1,Depends firstly on the CPT codes used. Typically a bill like this would be broken into a 3-part claim. Anesthesiology charge Facility (hospital) charge Physician (doctor) charge  Your best bet right now is to get your EOB (explanation of benefits) from your insurance AND a total bill from the provider. Get as much info as possible such as the claim info/CPT code/provider names including the facility. Then play spot the difference between the two documents. Also make sure youre being charged properly i.e. in-network & covered services. Make sure what do these payments go towards? Deductible/coinsurance/copay/out-of-pocket maximum?  If theres a discrepancy or service that wasnt performed you can challenge it. Otherwise ask for some kind of forgiveness or payment plan from the provider.

hmcdsid,jellicle,11/27/2021,1,As part of the sale you would typically request a utility certificate a statement from the utility that the payments are up to date. Was that done? Because as the buyer you want to buy the house without buying surprise obligations. If a lawyer was involved thats what youre paying the lawyer for. Or title insurance same thing.  Your problem is surprisingly complex and can be approached a lot of ways. Argue with utility including talking to ombudsmans office if it exists. Contact your lawyer. Contact your title insurance. Contact the previous owner.  Whatever part of the bill happened after you took ownership is yours. The other part is the previous owners although it might be put on the utility or on your title insurance or your lawyers practice insurance etc. Ask the utility to give you an estimate of how much was incurred before and after you took ownership.

hmd7yba,Psychological-Cow-21,11/27/2021,1,As a Chase insider Im very curious to know what strategies they are trained to use in case they are unable to make the sale. My friendly advisor became an aggressive ass when I told him I didnt want to go through with the wealth management. Are fear tactics part of their practice?
hmakmq7,Chinpokomaster05,11/27/2021,1,Sorry you got scammed. Process wise should seem like a red flag if theyre doing the transaction this way vs you buying the computer myself and getting reimbursed. They shouldnt be writing checks without detailed invoices to support the amount theyre writing. And then the obvious question of why cant they make the purchase and send you the hardware
hmcuqp8,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,Depends on the payments.  Both would probably get approved.  We’re also not talking about someone with a 20% downpayment. We’re talking about someone who sounds like they have a negative cash position
hm9wst4,ghostrecon11,11/27/2021,1,Very fair points. It was definitely something mental and also for wanting to have more wlb (less travelling etc). I’ve spoken to people in the new firm who have left and said the hours were not that much better and there is a fair bit of travelling too

hma5sx9,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,In my old broad lived through a lot seen even more opinion...  Define what nicer houses means to you. Neighborhoods? Value? Nifty kitchen gadgets? Fabulous bathrooms? A yard?   Then interrogate exactly WHY you want it why youre willing to spend for it etc.   Then ask yourself this really harsh question. If the GF wasnt in the picture  what would you choose? Then ask why its different.  Now a more broad question. What do you mean good use of a raise? Perhaps start by defining what you believe is a bad use of the raise.   If this house is just a financial stepping stone on your way to a defined goal it might be better to make decisions based on risk and math. But if this house is meant to be your home -- your sanctuary and respite from the world a place to live laugh and grow as a human being -- well then plan and buy accordingly while factoring in risks and stresses from owning it that may have the potential to steal from your peace and joy.   Money isnt the only variable in these decisions.   Me? We live in an average home in an average neighborhood. No mortgage fully paid for. Weve customized some things over the decades that make our daily lives better -- without regard to what increases resale value or what is considered normal.  It works for us. We remain happy and contented here. There is no one true way when it comes to buying a house you want to be your home. My best advice is always begin major decision making by leaning hard into why you want a thing. It helps define the landscape of the decisions to he made.   Congratulations on your raise. Sounds like you have a history of making good decisions. 👍

hmct4uc,lenswipe,11/27/2021,1,Absolutely.   I had a similar experience with my dentist. They billed me $x thinking that insurance only covered up to $y but it ended up being covered a lot more and thus the amount I technically owed was lower. I called up explained and they were really nice about it and refunded it back to me on my payment card.  TLDR: They deal with this stuff all the time it shouldnt be a big deal at all. Definitely call.
hmb4wzs,invenio78,11/27/2021,1,That typically doesnt work and whos to say that its not the spouse that will be sued.  I think overall if you are married you should expect some risk absorption of your spouse.  If not married you are essentially two strangers in the eyes of the law.
hmd2can,iSOBigD,11/27/2021,1,7% is a very high interest you should always aim for zero outstanding balance on credit cards from one month to the next.  After that I would focus on having waaay more than $200 to spare per month before buying a house.  Your combined income is very low and your savings seem to be also...imagine you buy a house and need to fix a roof and replace a furnace or water heater (which happens to everyone at some point)...You might need $10k-$15k and here you are scraping by $200 at a time.  You can easily end up in high interest debt again and dig yourself into a hole so be careful.  In your situation I would think about lowering my expenses as much as possible maybe renting a really cheap place so I could quickly pay off all debt and save up a good amount before getting into bigger expenses.
hmcys9o,IMI4tth3w,11/27/2021,1,Yes. I paid $1200 to my wife’s before we had our 2nd kid. 2 months before he was born I switched jobs/health insurance and new health insurance covered wayyyyy more and I got all $1200 back.

Skincare does not have to be very expensive ( I only use Vaseline on my face no make up). If you have acne problems a few thousand dollars out of your savings should not matter many years from now.

Thats right when the market started to drop so (at the time) selling would have been a loss.  Ended up renting out the house.  Mortgage company didnt care as long as the payments were current.  Property tax did care as its a difference tax rate.   Note being a landlord is not easy.  I recommend finding a (good) 3rd party company that will take care of all lease agreements and 3am phone calls. Its worth the money. Especially if you are not near by to keep an eye on things.

This type of planning has paid off over the past 30 years.  The goal being living reasonably your entire life vs retiring with as much money as you can.   You don’t get a return on your investment until you sell but debt is with you always.

hmc0ary,kgal1298,11/27/2021,1,You do get tax benefits. I think some people have had bad experiences. I married someone who was bad at finances and just about ruined me. With that said many couples get married and start off poor I think the important part is being on the same page with finances and aligning your goals or it can be bad. This is just the truth I’ve lived though it could be different for others. Also if either of you have different incomes id suggest checking some finance channels for how to budget I think the percentage method works the best or it can easily become overwhelming. Either way the point is no marriage isn’t necessarily more expensive than being single as long as you’re aligned and truly partners you can be fine.

hma7c92,_c4rli3,11/27/2021,1,Thank you. I tried to do everything as I was supposed to. I actually went back through my emails and Ascensus did instruct me to give the new check to my employer
hmaagl6,robb0995,11/27/2021,1,The stubs may state what dates they’re paying you for (pay period beginning/end) but I’m not sure what a reissued check would look like.   Regardless just call and ask them. If you were overpaid they’ll tell you how to pay them back to avoid any problems.
hmbez4y,CabinThinker,11/27/2021,1,OP - you seem like you’re probably pretty wealthy based on the size of your investment in individual stocks. Your investing goals might differ from the average investor on this sub.   My advice to you is to try to 1) concretely identify your goals (yes of course to make more money but to what end? Is this money you need for retirement? What’s your time horizon? Is it money you’re comfortable taking a lot of risk on and potentially losing in order to make a huge short term gain?) and 2) Pick an investment strategy to match those goals.   A lot of people are going to tell you not to work with an advisor or that that they wouldn’t buy individual stocks or crypto. For example i would never do either of those things because i hate paying fees and because individual stocks are very volatile assets (and that goes double for crypto).   But the bottom line is you need to determine what you want. Do you have complicated finances that might require specialized knowledge and planning? If so maybe an advisor is worth it. Are you looking to bet the farm to make a big score? More volatile assets might be for you.   You need to determine what boat your in what you need from your portfolio and how much risk you want to take. Without knowing that people can only tell you what *they* would do with the money.
hmco39d,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,Total market index funds.    Read the investing entry in the wiki
hmbzcjh,Conaz9847,11/27/2021,1,Yeah mainly as it will increase your credit score which will in turn get your access to providers who will be willing to offer better APR rates. But also because you don’t want to have multiple debts outstanding at any one time.

hmac87o,donniePump39,11/27/2021,1,I’m not sure that you’re correct here. Generally dividends would be taxed when paid however as this is an IRA the taxation isnt effective until you take distributions and thats the whole point of tax-deferred nature of retirement accounts
hmahh0t,fawningandconning,11/27/2021,1,6% how is your credit? Thats a pretty terrible rate.
hm9bn2q,BirdEducational6226,11/27/2021,1,Personally Id start smoking it at 15% minimum but you may want to talk to an actual FA. Talking to a financial advisor proved to be very successful for my family because sometimes it just helps to have someone tell you where to put your money how much how often and why etc. Everybodys situation is different though.
hmc3cio,boredprogrammerguy,11/27/2021,1,Ok then. Well what specifically works for me is having a specific goal. My wife and I want to retire when I hit 32. So we specifically save the percentage of our income to hit this goal assuming a conservative rate of return. Any leftover money is basically “unbudgeted”. My wife was pretty uptight about spending when we first got married but now that we have been doing it for a while she’s loosened up a lot. As long as we meet our savings goal (never more never less) we spend the remainder.
hma7pol,TK_TK_,11/27/2021,1,How old are you both and how much do you have in retirement? You don’t “max” a 401(k) until you put $19500/year in it ($20500) next year. So you’re only putting in the minimum to get the company match? With the matches what % of $105k are you saving? What % of $135k?   Don’t buy a house you can only afford if you aren’t adequately saving for retirement.
hmbgb5k,printerlampcomputer,11/27/2021,1,Lol funny comment not sure why people downvoted it. I mean I get they have different names in different states but still consistent with your joke anyone who is a fisher or hunter knows the names of the agencies they are hiding that extra or too small catch from.
hmb356o,Motobugs,11/27/2021,1,Ask HR. They may setup a limit for each pay period. My company does. Maximal match for each pay check is only 3%.
hmcseif,mt06111,11/27/2021,1,You can get a mortgage to buy your primary residence. If (after that) you move you can rent your property out. There is NO NEED to change the mortgage at all at that time.

hmckqfc,barebonesbarbie,11/27/2021,1,There are thousands and thousands and thousands of diagnosis codes its very possible that the ordering provider can update the associated diagnosis code to a different yet still medically appropriate one that might be covered by OPs insurance - which is in no way fraud.   My works EHR system even has a function that displays diagnosis codes by organ system or related diagnosis to help guide you to ones that are covered under CMS guidelines to help prevent the patient from getting bill.
hmb4kl7,zerogee616,11/27/2021,1,That makes more sense. If you had to cut any of those Id hold off on the HSA and 401k.

hmc16ra,clooneh,11/27/2021,1,They send you money to buy a program online and then ask you to send the remaining balance back. A number of business expenses are often put on a personal account and then reimbursed later.
hmd6g5x,MediumExplorer,11/27/2021,1,You are right. I’m thinking I would rather use the money I save to travel once the pandemic is over.   I’m sure these cars will eventually get cheaper. Tbh I never wanted to spend $50k on a car but used Teslas go for the same price if not more than new. There is no other car that has the instant acceleration that was so much fun to me. The other EVs aren’t sporty (like the Leaf Bolt etc).  I’m currently invested in VTWAX in my 401k and Roth IRA and thinking of putting the money I would have put on a down payment into stocks ($11000 in 60% VTI 40% VXUS $4000 spread across tech stocks like GOOG NVDA AMD)
hmc7hm1,cappuccinocatt,11/27/2021,1,Right. I’m aware of his issues but as long as he’s been like this he hasn’t lost thousands of dollars so it’s confusing to me.
hma7cye,bbh42,11/27/2021,1,If you don’t already get on a written budget.  I give my wife and I a monthly allowance that we can spend on anything.  We each get $60 per paycheck so $120 a month.  Most of the time we don’t spend it so we save it.  Both of us just paid cash for new Apple Watch 7 s from our allowance savings.  For other larger wants I set up a category in my budget and then fund it over time.  What I find is after a month or two we may decide we don’t want that item so we’ve eliminated a lot of impulse buying.    But if we still want it having the cash on budget helps eliminate the fear of spending.  Just start small fund the want and go buy it.  Overtime the feelings will subside as you focus on only spending that category vs looking at spending as it relates to your overall account.
hmalabw,fartsmellerMASTER,11/27/2021,1,I would contact a lawyer. You should be able to retain legal counsel with no out of pocket expenses if you have a case that qualifies in your location.

hmcmg8d,Fenderstratguy,11/27/2021,1,Agree - if you are very wealthy there is a role for insurance to offset inheritance taxes etc. But for we mere mortals if they are selling you an annuity or a life insurance policy that is NOT term life insurance they are making a hefty commission on that sale. They are a salesman not a financial advisor who is working in your best interest. Ask them if they are a fiduciary (must put your interests first ahead of their company). Are they willing to put that in writing and sign? Ask how they get paid and what percent they get on commission for the insurance policy. If they cannot be up front or evade your questions - run away. I would run away anyway because most people do not recommend mixing insurance products with investment products.
hmcijg1,scalenesquare,11/27/2021,1,But property taxes are forever. Mine are only 6k a year. Would be 12k now. Will be 20k in 5 years.
hm9rl75,Pass_Little,11/27/2021,1,First of all  you might want to post your portfolio and options in your 401k over at r/bogleheads after reading the stuff either in the sidebar or the about tab depending on how youre accessing reddit.  That group is excellent with helping people make sure theyre invested in a proven portfolio suitable for long term growth.  There are some non-obvious ways to mess this up.  One common gotcha in a 401k is not being aware of the fees that youre being charged on the specific funds youve chosen.  For example some target date funds charge far more than they should and picking lower cost options can net you many thousands of dollars.   Assuming you havent done something silly investment wise  the best advice I can give you is to keep contributing and only check on it enough to make sure your contributions are making it in the account and theyre being actually invested in your desired funds.   The market goes up abs the market goes down.   In the long term it has always gone up  even if there are some multi year periods where it went down.    Because no one can know when these peaks and dips will occur the best solution is simply to continue to contribute each month and do your best to ignore what is happening in the right now ans focus on the future.
hmb36pb,JhihnX,11/27/2021,1,I mean if you’re ever going to be in a position where you need those funds ASAP and can’t afford a turnaround time of 2-5 business days that would be a reason.

hmcw6l2,UGA10,11/27/2021,1,The FICO model was designed to output a score from 300 to 900.  Its just that simple. Based on all valid inputs its not possible to have an output less than 300.
hm9ao1f,Hayduck,11/27/2021,1,Wow thank you for the straight math answer that is very helpful and sobering.
hm9p8s6,my_new_throwaway106,11/27/2021,0,25% of the purchase price for closing costs?  Does that include the money down?   You can pull up to the amount you contributed to the Roth with zero penalties except you cant take the retirement savings tax credit for a few years.  That wont give you everything but its a start.

hmb7w28,terpischore761,11/27/2021,1,No you won’t. It’s the nature of the industry. Just be honest and polite about turning the job down.   It’s business not personal.
hmb8mae,SolutionLeading,11/27/2021,1,I’m not a financial advisor but here’s what I would do!  Step 1: save up $4000 in a savings account to cover you in case of an emergency. Based on my calculations this would cover your necessary expenses for a little over 4 months if you were to lose your job.  Step 2: Open a Roth IRA (or a 401K if your workplace offers one) and start contributing at least 15% of your income towards retirement.  Step 3: Save up anything left over for grad school and applying for scholarships to decrease the cost. Consider online grad school if possible to save money.

hmcnyne,TacoBOTT,11/27/2021,1,It it’s the flat 20% towards the loan is it usually applied to interest first or the principal?
hmcl38p,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1,Add him as authorized user to your oldest non-Amex card.  Also make sure to keep reported credit card balances super low. For the best possible scores you want one card to report a small balance say $5 and the rest $0. Credit scores dont care if you pay in full every month because most banks only report statement balance once a month. So you want to pay early to have a lower balance reported.  1 year old credit card should give higher than 690 score if reported balance is kept low. Ignore any of that nonsense you hear about 30% utilization at that point it really starts to impact your scores especially the older FICO versions used for mortgages. When I let 1 card report about 20% balance it drops a good 30 points and I dont have to counteract short credit history.  Read these:  https://creditboards.com/forums/index.php?/topic/574263-the-everything-about-mortgage-fico-scores-thread/  https://creditboards.com/forums/index.php?/topic/544017-the-master-2-reporting-trick-explained/  Also see if any of your cards do credit limit increase without hard pull. If so run down the list and ask for one. For the ones that ask for amount aim high ask for at least 50% more or even double. https://www.doctorofcredit.com/credit-cards/which-credit-card-companies-do-a-hard-pull-for-a-credit-limit-increase/  High credit limit lets you keep credit utilization low without having to watch the balance too closely. Of course for a mortgage it helps to watch it a little and make sure you have several reporting $0 and the ones that do below 10%.
hmanb78,my_main_I_promise,11/27/2021,1,It’s a really cheap hedge for sure
hma27pw,WolverineTherapy,11/27/2021,1,At $98k income you can afford more than $1000/month toward that CC debt.  You can kill that debt by January.  Babies are expensive.  Buy a Sams/Costco membership for formula and diapers - theyre not cheap but buying in bulk helps.  Clothes toys doctor bills they add up.  You want to bring the baby into the world with no non-mortgage debt.  Fun fact - at $114k mortgage balance you can have no mortgage in about 8 years if you threw your travel funds at the house.  Also everything is negotiable especially when youre an adult.  Youre 30 now.  Absolutism is for 20-somethings and 70-sonethings with nothing to lose.
hmc4sb1,UMfan11244,11/27/2021,1,Fuck. Can anyone make a generalized statement in 2021? Yeah no shit reputable tow yards exist. But in my town out of the 8-10 we have 8 are terrible. They all jack up their rates because they assume they’re just screwing the insurance company.

hmcwnzd,travelsurveykid,11/27/2021,1,Do you have a part-time job? Do you pay any of your own bills now? Do you intend to have a career? Be involved in the finances?  The issue that can occur when you get married before ever being truly independent is you have no accurate sense of how hard it is to make it on your own. Its not uncommon in older generations for one partner to leave all the financial management to the other. Lots of men and women who are widowed or divorced suddenly realize they have no idea how their bills are paid what they are or how to budget or they dont have any career history so they have to enter into the workforce at a late age with no experience.
hmaoj83,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/27/2021,1,Obviously controlling unsustainable spending is #1 priority but refinancing at current historically low mortgage rates to pay down high interest credit card debt is very sensible.  0% credit card balance transfer could also work but only if you can pay off the cards in that timeframe.  Otherwise you will be back to high interest rates and low mortgage rates may be gone.  Good luck.
hmbcax7,raznog,11/27/2021,1,Costs I mean for insurance and the super low interest. And I’ve had fraud with other banks and debit cards and it’s always been reversed. Some faster than others but honestly don’t use debit cards. Not worth the risk.

hm9jl8l,PersonalBrowser,11/27/2021,2,I agree with the general sentiment that the 50/30/20 is a made up tool that exists to help people waste less money. So good on you for getting beyond that point.   In terms of what to do with your extra money the investment category should include retirement savings with maxing your 401k and IRA (or whatever the equivalent is if you live outside the USA) and then usually taxable investment accounts if you still have money left over.   Long terms savings like holidays - eh holidays I’d count like personal spending but long term goals like a house or car or whatever you usually will just keep in a savings account.
hm9abir,bearjing,11/27/2021,2,Assuming the company match vests immediately it is still better to max out the 6%. Sucks to pay the penalty if he needs to withdraw but he will still end up with more money in the end.
hmd62qv,feistyfeline483,11/27/2021,1,I work with home sales and utility companies all across the US.  If Im reading this correctly there is a gas leak and it was not repaired when you purchased the home. The utility company was estimating the monthly costs of usage but only found out in Aug 2021 that they were understating it and the determined the amount owed for the last 2 years was $800?  Couple of questions:  1. If you provide proof of the repair and show the closing documents of you being the new owner will they waive the amount due?  2. Im assuming youve already spoken to a supervisor can you speak to someone in the disputes department?  3. Can you Google utility commissioner for [city/utility company and submit a complaint  4. Did you have an inspector done during escrow? How was this missed?
hmakwvx,wild_b_cat,11/27/2021,1,The money that you’re going to buy VTI with - is that money you have right now but are waiting to use? Or is it future income you haven’t received yet?
hmbz8ep,wanttostayhidden,11/27/2021,1,So much misinformation here.   The 6k for an IRA doesnt affect 401k contributions limits at all. That is completely separate.  The fund over $19500 can come from the employee and/or the employer. Some plans allow after tax contributions by the employee which allow the employee to contribute more than $19500. This year I am contributing $19500 pretax and my employer is contributing $5300 for my match. In addition to that my plan allows after tax contributions so I am contributing another $30000 in after tax funds and converting that to Roth funds (mega backdoor Roth). Ill be just short of the 58k this year. Separately I contributed $6000 to my Roth IRA.
hmazt7y,Pemi1099,11/27/2021,1,Im not sure a written contract gets you out of this case. Anyone can sue anyone for anything. Despite the contract she can still claim the the agreement was unlawful as they were married in the eyes of the law therefore she actually owns a portion of the house. It would probably come to the same result (nothing) but would still cost money.  I think a better protection would just be to document all expenses. That way if shit hits the fan you at least know what youve got into it and no one truly loses.
hmc7t1l,Dopeshow4,11/27/2021,1,They way prices on real estate are going it seems like a decent idea. We all need a place to live and housing doesnt seem like it going to be in a surplus for awhile.
hmb0ujr,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,Check your credit report theres a chance incorrect data is in there. If so work towards getting it corrected. You can ask the bank which credit reporting agency they pull from or just check all three of the big ones. Its free to get a copy from each agency once per year.  [https://www.annualcreditreport.com/](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/)  If its not an inaccuracy in your report that particular bank might just not extend credit to people with essentially zero credit history. Google something like best credit cards to build credit or best first credit card. Certain cards are more apt to accept borrowers with limited credit history.
hmcy7pj,ChicagoLaurie,11/27/2021,1,It seems to me spending a bit on yourself would help you feel successful confident and attractive and youd likely earn more money. What youre doing is not being frugal its being miserly. Choose to be kind to yourself.  Others have given detailed advice on budgeting money for clothing for example.  Buy yourself some comfortable clothes that fit well and make you feel good. Do a little research and find some reasonably priced skincare products.  You can find some at Target. Living as you are not taking good care of yourself when you are able to is not Ok.
hmdbgvz,hkline76,11/27/2021,1,Im a little late to the party but as someone who works in cardiology bite the bullet and pay it. If the doctor saw the abnormal EKG and didnt do the echo and you ended up with some form of carditis (myo peri epi etc.)  it could be bad. But like others have said its not a routine exam so its not covered on a routine check up so itll go towards meeting your deductible.
hmbz25e,KReddit934,11/27/2021,1,There were two: ..one was RMD from inherited IRA because FIL had not yet taken his...that is for sure taxable. The other Im not sure. He had an annuity invested in stocks with residual value when he died The letter that came with the check said heres  X dollars of which Y is taxable so we withheld 10% and state tax and sent you X - the withholding. Im not sure if thats income or capital gains? Short or long?  If hoping they will send a tax statement in January.

hma0akm,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for your reply!  I made a previous post about this if you want more details but quickly:  \-\~67k annually net (after all deductions)  \- 6 months worth of expenses in savings  \- Debt: We own our home with a mortgage.  We put in 1k/month actual mortgage is $815. We have two cars and the payments are $600/month for both.  No credit card debt finished paying off student loan debt in August of this year.  \- Husband needs some dental work done next year unsure of total cost just yet as he hasnt had his consultation with the oral surgeon until January.  I would guesstimate that it will be a few thousand dollars.  \- Trying to conceive currently.   \- Husband has applied to go back to school part time online.  We will have to rearrange some things should he get accepted and should he enjoy the program.   You can add a certain amount to your Roth in the beginning of the year?  I had no idea! I thought it had to be taken out of paychecks.

hmcx2uf,classicalL,11/27/2021,1,Your sister doesnt sound like she should get married honestly. If you cannot rely on someone and have very little trust in them you really probably arent mature enough or into the core ideas of what a marriage is enough to get married...  As to the fiscal aspects it can be beneficial in the US if you have unequal incomes because it will basically average the income. Take the extreme example of not being married but living together and one person isnt working and the other is making 150 k/year. Then your marginal tax rate is 12% ([https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/](https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/)) while filing single one person paid no tax but the other had a marginal tax rate of 24%. So you saved something like 8000 a year in Federal income tax in this case. If you both make exactly the same income then it doesnt make much income tax difference to be married and file jointly. Of course you risk your assets might get caught up if you divorce if you are significantly wealthier than your partner... So there are lots of things to think about.
hma3hg8,DirtyWaterDaddyMack,11/27/2021,1,1% of $52k = $520/yr...  Increase from 3% to 6% = ~$1500/yr Take home pay decrease = ~$1200/yr or $50/pay  If youre not contributing anything yet youre looking at a cost of $100/pay for a 50% match. Youre spending $2400/yr to invest $4500/yr that will compound.  Passing on a match of $1500/yr isnt the worst thing in the world for the short term but it wont give you $10k in a savings account anytime soon. Get the maximum match ASAP.  Buckle down and cut your monthly spending. In 5 years youre only regret will be not saving more. .
hmb12vn,Raeandray,11/27/2021,1,Right but a trusts job is generally just to divvy out the inheritance according to the will. It shouldn’t cost $5k for the trust to give the property to whoever is intended to inherit it.
hmd1coo,thishasntbeeneasy,11/27/2021,1,Compounding is that if you have $1000 in the bank gaining 1% interest after a year you now have $1010. Since you left your money in the next year gains slightly more than $10. It seems tiny in the beginning but the growth grows and turns long term savings into millions to retire on (hopefully!)  With stocks the plan should mostly be to leave the money there and hope it grows a decent amount each year. The gains are all unrealized until you sell the stocks while in theory should be a very long time away. If instead you sold part of your stocks every year to keep the balance the same as you initially invested you wouldnt make much interest.

I didnt realize that I dont have to wait till April 15th.  Seems like the best bet is to hire a CPA at this point and file taxes at the first available opportunity.
hmcyccr,superfastracingcar,11/27/2021,1,Just ask to meet at the bank and cash it with them there or ask to withdraw the money
hmcp99t,Pelian_Pines,11/27/2021,1,If you pay more in taxes it’s not because of the brackets. Your scenario is actually one where you save money by getting married.  Being in a tax bracket doesnt mean you pay that federal income tax rate on everything you make. You pay 10 percent of the first $20000 you make 12 percent of the next $60000 you make 22 percent of the next $100000 you make etc.  Since the married bracket is double the single bracket you still pay the same amount on your income. And your husband will pay less than he did before because he gets to use the spare room in your bracket before hitting the bracket he was in before.  Look up marginal tax rates for a much better explanation of this.
hmau4nx,kbecaobr,11/27/2021,1,Hide all credit cards. Do not touch them. Remove them from all apple pay google pay etc. Unsubscribe from all email newsletters like amazon clothing stores etc. Idk what is it that youre spending money on but you have got to stop it. Stop eating out you cant afford it. Live as if you were making 1 third of your income. Do not pay someone elses bills tell them to get a job if they can if not they might need help from someone else. Cancel any subscriptions youre not using. Increase your income either working more hours or finding a different job that pays more. Sell stuff you own and down use anymore (clothes whatever). There are a lot of youtube channels on finance look it up and study a lot.

hm97oxi,Greenappleflavor,11/27/2021,1,If your take home is $3400 and bills are about $2500 what happens to the difference of $900? Spent? Saved? Saved the spent on stuff like down payment on the card?  First you need to make sure you absolute want and can make a career out of CS.  That’s a lot to risk your egg nest retirement on.  Second I’m pretty sure while there’s no penalty for education there still will be taxes. You’d want to triple check.
hmd2cib,FutureBarrySeal,11/27/2021,1,See if there are any fundamentals for the stocks that would allow it to regain… or just sell and move on. Think of it this way… if there is another opportunity you can put your money in then that might be the way to go. It just really depends but never selling is also pretty bad. Got to know when to walk away.
hm8xswc,BuzzyShizzle,11/27/2021,-18,Nobody seems to give the guy the benefit of the doubt here?  He *asked* for money.

hma6q2j,king_of_not_a_thing,11/27/2021,1,I recommend using the retirement and 529 calculators on Bankrate to get an idea of where you’re at and where you’ll be at different savings rates and just adjust accordingly! And good luck with baby! We’re three months in and enjoying every minute. The biggest expense is going to be daycare. We started “paying for daycare” (I.e. setting aside the cost) before little one was born and ended up with a nice nest egg by the time he arrived.
hmahmdv,MizchiefKilz,11/27/2021,1,Its $25 now but will always go up. Plus you need to have some liability insurance as well in case someone trespasses and gets hurt on it.

hma74z4,zludderz4707,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for the very informative response based on hands-on experience and what to expect furthermore.   When I first got this call I kind of figured they were going to lean on a renegotiation with the financial group but then I got to worrying that I might be subject to a much higher payment than what I was given at first. The payment given wasn’t favorable by any means but what I was able to afford readily and was around what I was expecting before walking in the door.   If any issues come up like the gentleman over the phone left as disclaimer if you don’t mind I’ll provide an update with the specific details.
hmcw2z9,Jonko18,11/27/2021,1,The echo wouldnt be preventative care and since OP has a high deductible plan they must cover 100% until they hit their deductible which they havent. So no this wouldnt be covered.
hm9sol0,Ross11988,11/27/2021,2,Question is what’s your current expenses and how much do you need to live off of in retirement. Doing rough estimates it seems like based off the pension and retirement accounts you would have to live off of under 30K/year.

hmb791l,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,Your dedication to vacations is neither here nor there we all have our priorities. I would however encourage you to consider the types of vacations you take. If youre wining and dining across Western Europe $7k seems on point.   On the other hand there is a ton of fun to be had traveling to cheaper destinations. Two weeks visiting Costa Rica or Croatia is a joy. We tend to travel more backpacker style avoiding expensive hotels and limiting fine dining to a single evening. Otherwise we build our own itineraries and seek out all the national parks and street food we can find.  Your tastes may vary but you could potentially save an extra $3k or more by changing up your travel style. Food for thought.
hmboxr3,hurricanedan229,11/27/2021,1,Yeah thats another good thought. Thanks for your input
hmcpjpb,janet_colgate,11/27/2021,1,Youve gotten some excellent advice here so Ill just say Congratulations! and wish good health to you and your little one.
hmb3tql,Its-a-write-off,11/27/2021,1,Maybe more like 3 million since they probably still have some basis as well as selling costs. So Id roughly guess 1 million in taxes.
hmarghh,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,$2300 on groceries/eating out isnt because you live in a HCOL. Its because youre choosing to spend that much.
hmcw1da,ta112289,11/27/2021,1,The initial checks by the GP (blood pressure listening with a stethoscope) count as preventive. The further investigation because they heard something concerning is diagnostic and no longer preventive. Typically theyll make you schedule another appointment to avoid this confusion. Also weird because a GP wouldnt normally do an echo...
hmaufw1,benj_frito,11/27/2021,1,Will speak with her tomorrow and get a better understanding of the situation.
hmbbklg,rella_or_not,11/27/2021,1,I’m really sorry you’re in distress. Regarding your skin I think that is a worthy thing to spend money on. Scarring is serious. Go to doctor if you can but in the meantime make sure you are being gentle with your skin and you keep it clean. Chronic acne can be like an open wound that just is in a vicious cycle if it never heals. I go to a really pricey esthetician and she said that she recommends Korean skin care products to people on a budget or just starting out. You might want to do additional research but I would recommend just focusing on getting a cleanser and a moisturizer. I really like [Soko glam](https://sokoglam.com). You deserve to live in a healthy body your skin included.
hmcq4r7,LyricalPig,11/27/2021,1,First and foremost dont buy a house if they arent your spouse.  Either marry the girl or keep renting.
hmdbq7b,ERCOT_Prdatry_victum,11/27/2021,1,Besides getting a lawyer involved I would ask the company to describe in writing why they think they are entitled to any money.
hmae9k1,Inevitable_Welcome23,11/27/2021,1,I would say check the loan to make sure it drops. There are plenty you just have to refinance to properly get out of the pmi. Which is expensive for a house as you have to pay closing costs and other fees to refinance like you would for buying a new home. It is best to get a loan without a pmi in the first place or make absolutely sure your pmi drops at 20% (not in 5 years or a percentage higher than 20% LTV).   It can be an option but that doesn’t negate the fact that the market is red hot and burning people right now  Edit: make sure the loan takes account of appreciating property values as banks will often keep your original appraisal value as the pmi basis (this makes you keep the pmi longer in a hot market)

hmcxmok,FunForDDS,11/27/2021,1,How do people still fall for these scams? This has been going on for over 20 years. Dont cash checks and then send money.
hmbswwv,93195,11/27/2021,1, No impact to your credit not sold either (and it wouldn’t matter if they were) just changing servicers.  This isn’t about credit score anyway it’s about cost.  If the interest rate is fairly high (>5%) pay them off and save yourself some money.  If the non-deferred interest rate is pretty low (<3%) put your money to work elsewhere and pay minimums.  If the interest is in between you do you.
hmb1xtj,ThrowHomeAwayM,11/27/2021,1,Ill have to look into this thanks man

hmdadzn,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,Check out the FIRE flowchart to make sure all other bases are covered. https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ecn2hk/fire_flow_chart_version_42/  Talk with your HR representative about doing megabackdoor Roth IRA (after tax 401k rolled into Roth). Youll do the regular backdoor IRA yourself totally separate save the end account.
hmajtqt,tiny_questionz,11/27/2021,1,I did this after getting debt free. What I did was I started automatically depositing money every paycheck to a savings account in another bank that I never look at. I bumped my 401k contribution as well. So I am working towards my savings goals and still have some money to play with but its not all in the same big account. I almost never use credit cards because it is so easy to go overboard.
hmbaai6,HemingwayHuxley,11/27/2021,1,Yeah we do try to budget them cost effectively. For this years trip the destination is Chile backpacking through Patagonia so the budget looks like $1100 dog boarding $2200 flight $800 Airbnb $500 flights within Chile (2) and were budgeting $400 for 14 days food. Plus souvenirs $200.  So ~5k. The extra 2 are for visiting family once per year.
hmbaa4x,taurusfeeling,11/27/2021,1,1. Call first and see if they’ll waive the overdraft if you pay a certain amount toward the balance  2. Imo yes pay as much debt as you can now if it’s high interest debt (over 4-5%).  Paying off debt is almost like a guaranteed return. You can continue to average into crypto while paying off your remaining debts. It will be here for awhile and the market is just growing.  The mental ease from having little or no debt and the freedom to invest your extra cash as you see fit is worth it. Just my 2¢
hmd0un3,thishasntbeeneasy,11/27/2021,1,>if you plan to make the purchase with a credit card that has purchase protection  I have a couple but the deal is typically a 90-120 day return window or an extra year warranty if it was 3 or less to begin with. I tried to make a claim on an item once and they certainly use every trick to deny it - they required that I get a repair quote from a place I wouldnt be using for repairs and I ultimately gave up.
hmcos7k,ChaoticSquirrel,11/27/2021,1,Thats your answer then. The $700 goes toward your deductible. Once youve met the deductible your insurance will start paying for non-preventative care.
hmbxjsu,zeppo_shemp,11/27/2021,1,Fahrenheit or Celsius which is more accurate?
hmcsmx6,Baudin,11/27/2021,1,Yes banks do. You need to have total debt service ratio in order for a mortgage to work roughly 40% or less of your gross income should go towards serving debt INCLUDING the mortgage. Having high interest debt makes clearing this hurdle harder to do. High debt utilization (not paying off the entire card regularly) also negatively impacts credit score. Regular on time payments of a term loan (student loans mortgage  car loans) helps your score.
hmavew6,UGA10,11/27/2021,1,If you file separately and you itemize your spouse must also itemize.  There are other restrictions as well once you decide to file separately. I think in most cases it usually makes sense to file jointly but you would need more information than income to make that final decision.
hmcy0cj,caltheon,11/27/2021,1,Might want to check that definition of preventative again
hmcgw19,jsboutin,11/27/2021,1,Marriage is a pretty low financial impact. Having kids is a different story but I can’t think of a single way marrying my partner would change my finances (except for the wedding itself).  I’d say go for it if you want to marry him (assuming he also wants to).

hmbub2y,applexpeel,11/27/2021,1,that’s exactly what i’m confused about because the terms say 1200 will be charged but only 70 a month will be on the statement. however if the full charge is on the card then wouldn’t the full balance of the card also be on the statement ?
hma1gv6,antifaction,11/27/2021,1,Look at the prime directive in this subreddits menu. You have 10K for your emergency fund you need to next max out any employee 401k funds matching (free money). Then you need to continue your plan of $1000 a month for credit cards. Pay off any debt over 4%. Next you should get your 401K contributions up to about 15% or so. After this is in place you can save for other goals contribute to non-tax advantaged accounts like an index VTSAX for example.
hmb64nf,queeniev14,11/27/2021,1,PNC is fine.  Everyone Ive dealt with over the phone and at my branch has been generally pleasant and competent I get reimbursed for non-PNC ATM fees and the only time I got an overdraft charge it was due to bad mental math on my part but I still got it reversed by going to the branch in person and giving them a sob story.

hmajd04,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,Of course you’re correct.  But I know you knew that already. 401k are not subject to FICA.   But 457’s are.  So…  I suppose OP could just multiply 7.65% by Total 457 and add that to the total taxable obligation.
hmabs7q,digitalhelix84,11/27/2021,1,Chase absolutely 100% can tell you of the check was cashed and provide proof.    If they say they cant email the CEO and tell them they say they cant.  The executive relations team will call you in a day or two and will actually research and solve your issue.  If you need the CEO email use Google Id give it to you here but was banned from another sub for sharing.    If it wasnt cashed ask them to put it back in your account and also show proof it was sent.  Share this with your landlord offer to pay and if they want to give you fees show them its their error.  If they still want to charge you fees Id probably complain to a local regulatory authority.  In my state id complain to the attorney general.
hmcskei,1SecretUpvote,11/27/2021,1,Oh wow thats a lot of info to give out. Ill look into it but idk if Im confused with all that. Thank you though I didnt know of that sub.
hmbcy0r,Hexcyn,11/27/2021,1,Drivable doesnt mean it wont be totaled. Source: my car was damaged while parked and I didnt notice until I had driven a few miles. I drove to the body shop and then called my insurance (learning experience - call them first). The car was still totaled. Cost of repairs was more than 75% of the value on a $6k car. Insurance paid for the value of the car and a rental for a week or two while I scrambled to get a replacement.

hmcdi92,blitzinger,11/27/2021,1,Job market is hot. Keep looking. You can do better. What city are you in if you don’t mind me asking. I’m in NYC. Just switched jobs and got a 46% increase in salary plus swung a nice signing bonus
hmd8b28,Varathien,11/27/2021,1,Is there an actual reason? Who knows.   However I would theorize that having bizarre score ranges makes it easier to identify when people have no clue what theyre talking about.   For example if you didnt know anything about credit scores but wanted to pretend to have a good score maybe you would claim to have 100. Someone with any familiarity with credit scores would instantly be able to tell that you were lying.
hmas387,FutureBarrySeal,11/27/2021,1,So…. $100-$200 extra for a “much nicer” home and you don’t know if having an extra $800 on top of your surplus vs $1000 aka $200/month for a “much nicer” home is worth it? You’re also buying a house worth more that can be sold for more. I don’t see where the problem is? Unless you’re super frugal and want to retire as early as possible and save every penny it makes no sense not to. Higher earnings is meant to improve life within reason. There’s a difference spending that $1k on a really nice car that would depreciate quite a bit vs $200 on a house that’s inherently worth more and can be sold for more. Life style creep isn’t bad if kept in check. If you lived on a $30k salary and got Bumped to $60k it’s not bad to live on $40k. Get the nicer house. But not with a GF
hmccqy7,LetsBeCoolMan,11/27/2021,1,Nope! We are moving to Maine and she won’t have a job so there’s no point including her. I also have better credit
hmatrgg,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,> What should I do?  Go to another seller.  If your question is really:  * How can I compel this particular dealer to sell me a car for 23k?  Then you’re likely only going to be wasting your time/effort/energy.
hm8xg0x,KhonMan,11/27/2021,6,It depends what the risk of being caught is. If he assessed the risk as almost 0 it makes sense.
hmbbnef,frozeninjpthrowaway,11/27/2021,1,Whereas I would say theres great benefit especially for transactions made on Fridays and days before holidays where not processing it that day means it wont arrive until after a weekend (long or regular).
hm9pwrz,hyperlaser,11/27/2021,2,Assuming credit score is strong I would say this is the whole point of having good credit - to be able to leverage a good financial track record to get access to things like this.
hmc4pv5,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,I really wonder how many people paid trade fees to buy VTSAX at their non-Vanguard brokerage because all they see is VTSAX recommended here.

hmcgn7f,Stoic_Chief,11/27/2021,1,Yeah this is another piece of the puzzle - I was looking for new opportunities but I wasn’t doing so aggressively. I need to get on that. Because like you said at a minimum I’m still paying 1200 more in rent next year plus the cost of moving if I do decide to do so. If I stay I’m paying an extra 2400

hmbjksg,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,> Most people when they get married will share ownership of assets. Like their house cars bank accounts brokerage accounts.

Thats normally covered by homeowners insurance.  >I guess you could make really complicated asset separation to try and keep assets separate but 50% on each side but even then you are basically back to the original risk of being not married.  Doesnt need to be 50% on each side.  One of the spouses can own everything and the other still gets the benefit of it all.    >Marriage innately does not give asset protection that two unmarried people wouldnt intrinsically have.  Sure but it can provide more options
hmceb97,F1nal_fall3n,11/27/2021,1,My wife and I married within a few months of knowing each other and we were both not exactly financially stable me having addiction problems and being on the brink of homelessness but needless to say we paid 150 bucks for a marriage license and certificate and we did a small courthouse wedding and 5 years later here we are with 3 beautiful daughters later and in a 4 br house we’re renting. We are both more financially stable now than either of us has ever been. I’m not saying to go and jump and get married but to simply answer your question. No it’s not expensive to be married
hm9yrd8,aaaaij,11/27/2021,1,personally I would go with the advice in the sidebar which says something different - to first research and understand the pros and cons of Roth vs traditional in the context of your situation. Plenty of people have reason to prefer pre-tax savings which they cant get with a traditional IRA due to the income limit on the deduction also have good funds in their 401k.   For those people the priorities should be 1) get employer max 2) max out 401k 3) max out Roth IRA  We dont know if OP is one of those people or not
hmcu0xw,Hambone6991,11/27/2021,1,Anyone who is married will tell you that marriage is all about compromise on both sides. I know for me it would be a whole heck of a lot easier to compromise with somebody in that side of the spectrum as opposed to the other end.
hmb3xzf,Daredizzle,11/27/2021,1,You say you max your 401k up to the match but thats not what people here mean when they say you should drive to max your 401k contribution theyre referring to the $19500/yr maximum.
hmcmsd0,slaytherabbit,11/27/2021,1,Do you work for a nonprofit? They may be paying portion of your compensation package from tax deductible donations and another portion from a sister org with  donations that are not tax deductible or earnings from a different entity. Nothing shady its just how the tax code works.

hmd1dtd,_c4rli3,11/27/2021,1,Thanks :)
hmcirgn,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,Yes that would be a large disparity.
hmataam,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,The difference is not the dividends.  The difference is going to be in the rebalancing and the actual investments themselves.  If the investments are exactly the same as the underlying TDF holdings then it is going to be the rebalancing that makes the bigger difference.
hmaohvj,NoMoLerking,11/27/2021,1,Have they ever given you a zero balance statement? That’s probably the only way this will stop since it actually forces them to update their billing system.
hm98ryv,roombataxi,11/27/2021,1,Pretend like the error didnt happen and the amount now was the first amount.  Is it a good deal?  If so then do it.  Its a slightly less good deal because of the hassle but its still a good deal.  If its not a good deal at the new numbers then call it off.  Focus on your long term goals not on transaction hassles.  Its not like youll have to deal with this guy every week.
hmbl4js,Inb4BanAgain,11/27/2021,1,Insurance companies and diapers should be changed frequently and for the same reason.   If your dads been with them for years hes probably getting ripped off on all his policies
hmc7spo,yellowcanvas,11/27/2021,1,I havent personally been but i know a few people who do. It’s an open warehouse type gym kind of like crossfit gyms and it’s locally owned. It’s mostly BJJ and kickboxing and a sectioned off gym area that not a lot of people use (so few people and also no creeps) unless it’s to supplement for bjj/kickboxing but i would only go for the gym.
hm9ctzg,Look_Specific,11/27/2021,0,Says worth 3700 but is really worth 1500? I am confused! Sell it  its prob not economic fixing it.
hmah7oj,Chinpokomaster05,11/27/2021,1,So how did they explain the reason for you to wire them the $3200?
hmb5w6x,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,Possibly.  Depends on the spouses.  A stay at home parent likely has less liability than a tradesman for instance.
hmaiq2p,RoastyMcGiblets,11/27/2021,1,Is it legal to sell baked goods created in your home in your area? Its common (in the US anyway) that you have to use an approved kitchen. In my area everything has to be stainless steel and there can be no children or pets who have access to it - thus many bakers rent space in commissary kitchens. So first off Id not quit my job if you are operating under the radar where your income could be shut off based on a complaint from a competitor.   Youd have to decide if the risk of being self employed justifies the reward. IME many entreprenuers fail to account for the time spent on marketing taxes and other housekeeping stuff. And they dont charge enough to be able to contribute to 401Ks (and you never get an employer match) or to be able to take time off. They end up half-assing everything until they are stressed out and frustrated and throw in the towel. If youre going to do it just make sure you have the mental and physical bandwidth to do it right.  I think Id stick with the day job until your debt is paid off and you have some breathing room financially.
hmb2qv5,charleswj,11/27/2021,1,You never said that the closest you got to that was the following:  >As long as you make more than federal minimum wage for most of your working life  But fine my original comment adjusted up a dollar above federal minimum wage:  $8.25/hr works out to ~$17/yr. After federal tax and FICA thats almost $15.5k remaining or less than $1300/mo. Saving $95/mo in that scenario would **still** be next to impossible and thats not accounting for even the slightest emergency or unforseen unexpected expenses.
hmak9k2,uhno28,11/27/2021,1,Like others said its what you make it. If one has debt and the other doesnt one person will be going to a worse financial state for example. However theres the upside of sharing expenses like housing bills and groceries which usually tend to be cheaper when shared (like with roommates).  In our case we married while my husband was still in college and I had a couple of years of exp in my field. We didnt spend more than a few hundred on our wedding neither had any debt and we share 100% of the same views on finances saving spending etc so in our case being married has been fantastic including financially. We have combined finances and we can afford a lot more than each of us could individually and when one of us has lost income for some reason weve always been able to withstand it with no problems due to living beneath our means (which is really hard to do when single unless you are making a lot of money ofc) and having the others income to fall back on.  The one thing I can say is that I couldnt imagine being this financially tied to someone if we werent COMPLETELY compatible money-wise. Marrying to someone whos a spender or who needs you to manage all finances because they are like a child with money then that would be a hard no for me.
hmbqyu5,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,Is there income generated in the Wise account (e.g. interest)? If so then that would be considered your income.  This does sound a little sketchy. Are you sure the money being held in that account is legally obtained? If not you could have bigger issues than the potential tax consequences. It can be very risky to hold money for someone else if you dont know them ***very*** well.
hmc9e88,galacticpeonie,11/27/2021,1,The issue is that there are no conventional options available only option is private lender for raw unserviced parcel of land (canada). Once we have a house built we can get a more conventional mortgage at a more reasonable interest rate. So that is why I am seeking advice on the best case scenario for this interest rate  I recognize its ridiculous.
hm9ezum,CedarBuffalo,11/27/2021,1,What is the cost of living like where you live? What is the minimum wage where you live?  Are you trying to support anyone other than yourself? Are you dependent on your parents?
hmd8ntk,YukiAlters,11/27/2021,1,I’m in a similar situation with in network doctor and out of network blood test. My approach is: check if there is a provider agreement with the insurance company which may dictate that if it is not an emergency routine laboratory or imaging services must be referred to a participating lab. If yes  doctor would be in breach of this agreement and would be required to cover all costs. (This is not legal advice.)
hmc4vr3,Lethalmouse1,11/27/2021,1,Thanks! That was what I was looking for a sensible baseline. So a 5 year + 18 should logically be at least 670 if not a little more. 😀
hmasnlt,drownedbubble,11/27/2021,1,As other people have said you really just need to pay the balance of the statement.   But….  When I got my first credit card I would make weekly payments to ensure that I didn’t overspend thinking I had extra money in my account.
hmcvjtl,adifferentmike,11/27/2021,1,The day before they recover 10%. That’s my strategy apparently.
hm8wyal,nospamkhanman,11/27/2021,13,I used to work for a bank a few years ago. We had about 30 people fired on the same day because they were caught looking the bank account of a major celebrity that happened to open up an account with us.  Thats it just looking. Canned.
hm9z02s,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,Unfortunately my company only does a match with a traditional 401(k) and its not really a match- they only put in 3% regardless of what you contribute.  Im unsure about my husbands.
hmajep7,TrainedCodeMonkey,11/27/2021,1,I’m in this exact scenario and we avoid the power struggle by splitting the mortgage by our ratio of income. For easy numbers let’s say she makes 50k and I make 100k I pay 66% of everything. All major renovations and down payments are on me.
hmcqesj,ProgrammerInProgress,11/27/2021,1,All other things equal means equal assets and payment history? Then person B has a better credit history
hmc4ino,Plati23,11/27/2021,1,I don’t think I’ve ever set a number to it but this is pretty much what I do.   For me it’s basically the more raises and promotions I get the more focused I get on savings retirement and investing while still allowing a modest lifestyle creep. I can definitely see why setting numbers to it would be beneficial though.
hmc8nst,Default87,11/27/2021,1,if you leave a balance like you said in your first post you will pay interest on that balance.  you should pay your statement balance by the statement due date each and every month.  you do not pay interest that way.
hmd3zq9,DigitalPelvis,11/27/2021,1,A luxury that comes with a ton of responsibility. I’m a homeowner - that means the people I call for a roof leak toilet leak or busted stove are a roofer plumber or appliance repair person rather than just a landlord. All of those come with a lot more expense and risk than calling the person with all the responsibility.
hmcpmpc,jhonkas,11/27/2021,1,wasnt specified in the post that you have property background or history.  wouldnt expect anything unless its explicit. just heads up as a life lesson
hm9fh9c,Naive-Inspection,11/27/2021,1,no because this cc has an annual fee Ive never applied for a cc w/ an annual fee
hmaazx1,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the info. We are hoping to be in this house for a long time but are trying to be realistic that we may want to move again to a better school district down the road when we have more kids or have more money. I know logically that buying this house doesnt mean well be here forever but its definitely something to consider between the loans.
hma5pdn,Earthquake14,11/27/2021,1,Wasn’t asking for relationship advice but appreciate the concern. Marriage is an outdated tradition anyway.
hmcz6l3,cloverdoodles,11/27/2021,1,I mean you shouldn’t be trying to talk down a bill because you didn’t understand your health insurance plan. This isn’t a case where you’re being screwed by being forced to accept out of network services during surgery. It’s on you to investigate in advance of medical procedures being performed
hma16tp,fullactualization,11/27/2021,1,Sounds like you’re in a relatively stable financial position but have a couple major expenses coming up (I recently found out from friends that having a child is EXPENSIVE!!). I’d still recommend contributing up to the Roth IRA limit if you think that makes sense for you. Yes so by contributing I meant putting X% portion of my paycheck - I just adjusted timing of my “contribution” so that I contributed 100% of my paycheck into the Roth IRA initially (then stepped down mid year) rather than the automatic fixed monthly 5-30% that most folks do.
hmavcvo,DeBallZachBulls,11/27/2021,1,Where’s it at? I’ll buy it for nature conservation.
hmcyy2g,sneaky_fart,11/27/2021,1,If thats what your want just be clear and firm.  I want X.  If you cannot get me X Ill wait.  Ask of they can order you one.   They want you in the building to sell you something else.
hma5wtw,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,How wealthy are you?
hma2acz,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,That makes sense.  Thank you!  Yes kids are expensive which is why weve waited so long to try and have them (Im 27 husband is 28- at this rate Ill actually have the kid at 28 husband will be 29).  Im very type A and want to be a prepared as possible for well just about anything.
hmc8ylp,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Given her informal approach sounds like she is running a very profitable hobby so her income would be added to the income line of your taxes. And yes taxes owed would increase.   If you want her to start deducting expenses then she needs to run this as a serious business.
hmaztkv,Earthquake14,11/27/2021,1,Thanks I think I resonate with your comment the most.
hma2aye,Firm_Bit,11/27/2021,1,> At what point this increase in allowed budget becomes lifestyle creep?  When you start spending more than you would have on your previous salary for non essential upgrades.
hma2sb1,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,Thank you. Yes I am thinking about babysitting but that can be a childcare issue for me (Not many people like for the sitter to bring their own kids.). I live in a rundown apartment and I know people would not want to bring their kids to my home. Ive been following a babysitters group for years and most of the time when I see people request a sitter I see dozens of people respond trying to get the job. But I may try it soon. I am extremely well-qualified to babysit so maybe people would be interested in me.
hmbap2u,thememeconnoisseurig,11/27/2021,1,Income is high credit is still very low. Total credit limits are approximately 10% of income. I have been focusing on increasing my credit limits the last couple months.  Thanks for the reply!
hmbjqj7,OvereducatedCritic,11/27/2021,1,I wont disagree with you on that marriage is a force multiplier but I will say its a risk for both people from the jump. People change and you wont always see why. On top of that I feel like its hard to make life decisions/big financial decisions without the second party present. I would sooner opt for me vs the world since its less complicated and Im not risking my assets or anyone elses when Im married to someone I dont know fully/am sued for an arbitrary amount of money or for my assets. A teammate can just as quickly become an enemy or a liability if they have ulterior motives/ dont communicate/ are good at lying/get sick/...the list goes on.  Creating a unit means you go down with the ship you built and from what I have been reading those repairs(divorce) are wildly expensive. I think its a smarter decision to pursue full financial independence because that money will make/break you no matter what.
hmccwif,Ameteur_Professional,11/27/2021,1,The counterpoint is that when you buy a huge chunk of your housing costs are locked in for the next 30 years.  I have friends whos rents went up hundreds of dollars per month and my mortgage stayed the same.  You can also get kicked out of a rental through no fault of your own at the end of your lease.  Its an incredibly personal decision though.  I like where I live and plan to stay there forever.  I like doing home improvement.  It made a lot more sense to buy for my wife and I but I have friends who much prefer the flexibility of renting.
hm98dq1,Hayduck,11/27/2021,1,Very valid point and that makes it scary.  I’ve read a ton of articles about older people making the jump to CS/programming and it working out very well but were they the 1 in 100 that worked out for I don’t know.   I know ageism isn’t supposed to be a thing but I also live in the real world. I have looked into salaries and potential.  I looks like starting salaries are around 60k with the mean being around 100k.
hmd0z8j,palindrome03,11/27/2021,1,Same here ^. I had a referral for an MRI which I assumed was a diagnostic / covered procedure. Thankfully false alarm all good up in the head but then got smacked with a $700 bill with my high deductible plan lol
hmbu8bx,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/27/2021,1,Depends on what airlines you want to transfer to.  Hard to provide advice without that info.
hmc4cuq,jmediii,11/27/2021,1,There’s a lot wrong or half-true with this answer. First step here would be to dispute the claim with the insurance.
hmbw9ff,BastidChimp,11/27/2021,1,Yup its best to diversify. Your ETFs cover a broad market. The thing about dividend stocks is that in time when your principal investment is substantial enough you can use the dividends without cashing out your stocks.
hmal81l,NVPcMan,11/27/2021,1,A primary residence primary vehicle and retirement accounts are generally considered protected assets in bankruptcy unless you want to get rid of them.
hmcvqui,guy_from_the_gif,11/27/2021,1,So the debt was there when I first opened my credit card. The reason I found out about the debt was because when I got my credit score summary it said I had it. I don’t know where their credit reporting system is pulling the data that says I have this debt.
hmcuyjv,93195,11/27/2021,1,Assuming these are common circulated coins it’s not a huge value.  The silver in a dollar is worth around $20 a quarter more like $4.  Silver certificates Indian head or wheat pennies nothing special either.  Value wise you’re probably talking in the hundreds not thousands.  You can take them to a pawn shop or coin dealer for an offer or just sell them yourself on E-Bay.
hmc7idb,iranisculpable,11/27/2021,1,That is my fear
hmajw1r,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Zombie debt!   If you pay a penny it will reset the statute of limitations could bring it back onto your report and could open you up for new lawsuits.  Dont give them a penny.
hmc7wz8,PM_YOUR_MANATEES,11/27/2021,1,Youre going to get charged full price at some point whether or not you choose payments. If you want a smaller BALANCE to show make a payment as soon as the transaction posts and before the balance is reported to the credit bureau.
hmcxlbd,dequeued,11/27/2021,1,It would help if you specified which features are important to you.  https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions has a list of common recommendations.
hm9yyju,tyclune121,11/27/2021,1,It seems to be a fairly uncommon form from what I’m gathering from folks online such a pain in the ass procedure to get this done. Thanks for the info!
hmborpt,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,Not generally.  But you will have to verify with your particular financial institutions involved.
hmdavqx,inline_five,11/27/2021,1,Pretty much every used car nowadays is overpriced compared to 2019. Inflation shortages one thing after another. In 2018 the Accent sold for what you are buying used four years later...
hmbinrc,Wolverinex5,11/27/2021,1,Let animals live on it.  We need Carbon sinks as well.
hmaw8ft,ThanksSoMuchTangelos,11/27/2021,1,If money was spent to improve the investment does that change anything? I.e. wed remodel the kitchen. Im guessing that is also considered an investment but wondering if it changes anything that it runs through as a business expense?
hmcxuzw,cremedelapoo,11/27/2021,1,Ya right ok thanks i remember this now
hmbzs5f,m3003,11/27/2021,1,>This sub is always going on about VTSAX.  Might as well change the name to r/VTSAXonly.
hmax669,tdaddybxl,11/27/2021,1,Exactly. Donate it for conservation and split the tax bennies.
hmdak3m,aznkor,11/27/2021,1,Does your job offer an HSA-eligible HDHP? An HSA (health savings account) gives you tax benefits for medical-related expenses.
hmcspcj,BuildingCastlesInAir,11/27/2021,1,There are different theories about this but in my opinion if youre in debt that you cant pay off immediately you should pay off the debt before saving for an emergency fund. You can use the cards for emergencies. Theres a ton of arguments one can make against this but for me taking the risk that there wont be an emergency for a few months is worth the savings from paying off any high-interest debt.  As for saving for a house -- same. Pay off debt first as that debt will be accounted for when you apply for a mortgage. Or if you have any investments savings or retirement funds that can balance out the debt you can get a house sooner and then eventually get a home equity line of credit to transfer the debt to a lower rate secured by your home (but be sure you can pay it off or you risk losing your home).  Finally dont FOMO into a home. Home prices are either going to be too high or the economy is going to be in such bad shape that you wont have enough money to buy a home. But if youre disciplined and you really want one youll get one. No need to rush into it.   Renting has its advantages too including letting you be very mobile. And you wont necessarily be able to move from a cramped apartment into a spacious home. The home you can afford may be just as cramped or have more problems than you would have anticipated. GL.
hmd1sd1,JmnyFxt,11/27/2021,1,Go to the insurance companys web site and check the Explanation Of Benefits (EOB) for your visits.   It should explain who got billed and for how much.
hmcz8sl,Advanced-Blackberry,11/27/2021,1,That’s different because they stated free consult. I’ll bet my left this doc did NOT say the echo would be free
hm93q8h,Zookeeper1099,11/27/2021,1,You should never listen to people who give you percentage based rules never. It never works for everyone (in fact doesn’t work for most people)  You should first list out all the expenses that you MUST pay then list out the total amount that you are knowledgeable enough to consider as need and beneficial to have both of the amount that you can not reduce. Your goal should be saving everything left. Of course you want to once a while spend on things you want that’s when a monthly budgeting comes in handy. You should start with lower budget on the things you want and gradually make changes until you balance it out and settle on a mount you feel comfortable with then stick to the plan forward.  Personally my spending has never had anything to do with how much I make at the time. I only care and make sure every dollar I spend makes sense. Am I lazy enough to order delivery vs picking up to save $5? Do I really need a new computer? If I make sure every dollar I spent has gone through some level of decision not just spend without thinking I don’t need a % to save I don’t even need budgeting. Also I have never spend extra only because I started making more. Expenses should decouple from income.
hmd2onm,itsworththewhile,11/27/2021,1,Honestly this should be the first place anyone looking for a mortgage goes. Usually better rates and more personal service.
hm9y9bh,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,1,The change in responsibilities and huge jump in pay is very enticing. Its growth on two different fronts and doors will always open in the future. Plus your network will expand. Now im curious how this plays out for you haha
hmbkkxv,pownedju,11/27/2021,1,Good advice. I need to look more into the cost of online grad school. In my area I think 50-60k is likely what I’d be making as a clinical therapist just starting out.
hmam9xg,Annabel398,11/27/2021,1,The sister’s advice reminds me of a zillion Twitter threads that begin with someone bemoaning divorce: “our grandparents stayed together for life why don’t we?” and end with dozens if not hundreds of women replying “granny took me aside and told me ‘always have some money of your own so you can get out of a bad marriage if you need to’” (interspersed with a couple of tales of granny ditching or even offing abusive gramps and going on to live her best life).   It’s not always about the money… but money is a tool and it can fix or at least help a lot of problems.
hm9062a,NoMoLerking,11/27/2021,19,That is definitely what they said. “Print the message.”  Good job. 👍
hmbxy28,B_R_U_H,11/27/2021,1,With the used car market being what it is now he could probably sell that car to car max or carvana pay off the lease and have money left over

hmaja0s,Firm_Bit,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the tip. Yeah all things we need to consider. And it maybe that weI’ll simply lower contributions. Thanks for the insights!
hmbmldt,Undercovergreen,11/27/2021,1,The insurance company isnt under any obligation to make your premium cheaper. Youre doing the right thing by checking other companies but the only way to get it cheaper is to pull the trigger on a different provider. Some providers are better than others but you should be able to find someone willing to be more compeitive to attract you. To answer your broader question i dont think your dad is overcharging you but if he were to migrate all his cars he may save money on every car. There will be a big difference when you turn 25 but until then youre in the high risk group and youre gonna pay a lot.
hmd17et,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,Yes. Scammers take advantage of this. Happens all the time.
hm9ydcq,vulcanjedi2814,11/27/2021,1,Yes
hmcekqw,ghostboytt,11/27/2021,1,Probably got scammed over the phone and he handed them the money.
hmbc5ny,ZWilde17,11/27/2021,1,You dont have to spend that much on skincare. Curology is a good place to start. They have certified dermatologists thatll help with your skin problems with relatively decent pricing. (It ranges from 25-60) Ive tried it and Ive had good results. Customer service is great. I got a refund and a free bottle when one of the bottles they sent was expired.  Confidence is very important to have and will have an impact in all aspects of your life. From life quality to relationships to jobs. Id suggest you buy new clothes and skincare products. Theres nothing wrong with spending a bit on things that will help improve your self-esteem. Dress good eat good hit the gym and work on your mental health. Whether its with a therapist or just exploring new things about yourself.  Its easier said than done but try to remove or reduce things that stress you out or do things that relieve those stresses. Dont create such a strict budget or youll be constantly thinking about executing it to to T. Put some money aside and spend it on yourself.
hman8u8,wild_b_cat,11/27/2021,1,Right thats normal investing.  DCA  (in the modern usage)  refers to a specific strategy when you have a pile of money today that you want to invest but to avoid a badly-timed crash you want to enter the market in smaller pieces over time.  If youre just putting money aside from each paycheck thats just called regular investing. It doesnt have a special name.
hmaa4ci,bassclarinetca,11/27/2021,1,Wow you Americans need to get interac e-transfer down there. It sounds like your banks are even more sleazy money grabbing bastards than ours!
hmag7gg,ploetzlichbanana,11/27/2021,1,Like I said were comfortable but were not super rich either. I dont think we will exceed a few dozen thousands per child over the period. Lets call it 100k per child at age 18 including the re-invested interests to be on the safe side.
hmcalbw,VegasOldPerv,11/27/2021,1,>building perfect credit though? like 800+?   Be patient it takes years. Always pay your entire balance. never be late for a payment. Get a new card/ account about once a year. Until you have several accounts. Keep in mind that you do not need to pay interest for a good credit score.  Here is some reading material.

hma0z3b,HemingwayHuxley,11/27/2021,1,My recommendation? Go to college. Take it out in loans. If you want to enlist the Army will pay them if you enlist with a Bachelors and GI Bill resets at three years so you will likely get out with 36 months and can use it for masters or kids.  If this is not a possibility then get your degree while in using Tuition Assistance and your GI bill after the fact can still be used for masters or kids. Online classes while active duty are ROUGH though. 5yr Active Duty Army SGT 3 yr active reserve.

hmaxiyw,nothlit,11/27/2021,1,You do not necessarily need to liquidate anything in order to do the transfer. Assets can be transferred in kind (without selling). However once the non-Vanguard funds are in your Vanguard account you may have to pay fees to sell them through Vanguard assuming you dont want to keep them forever. Check each fund here to see what transaction fees Vanguard charges if any: https://investor.vanguard.com/other-funds/
hmbltin,dont_know_me_anymore,11/27/2021,1,The most important thing is teamwork. What do you each want your life to look like financially? What happens when you have kids? How do you want to prioritize saving for retirement and emergencies? Stuff like that. My husband and I admittedly didn’t discuss our finances enough before we got married or even early on in our marriage. As a result we did end up with more debt than we should’ve and not as much retirement savings as we could’ve if we’d just sat down and really talked things through better. It’s easy to not worry or talk much about money when the bills are always getting paid but you can get a false sense of security in that position. It took us probably 8 years of marriage before we really worked together to achieve common goals rather than just make sure the bills were paid.
hmasoq4,Birdy_Cephon_Altera,11/27/2021,1,Because most people **do** pay them back.        Every lender makes loans based on various risk factors.  For a certain group of people they may calculate that only 1-2% of them will default on their loan so that group of people gets a great interest rate.  For another group of people they might default on their loans 10-15% of the time and that group gets a terrible rate.      Interest rate goes up the higher the risk.  For predatory lenders an extremely high percentage of them are at risk of defaulting on their loans (like 20% or even 30%) so the rates offered to that group are raised to offset the losses incurred from deadbeats.
hmb2ox3,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,Thats a target date fund: it is internally diversified for you and handles becoming safer as the target year approaches. Target date funds are designed to be the only fund you hold. Similar funds exist for other years.
hmc7uk7,Fianna_Bard,11/27/2021,1,Walk no run away from that dealership.   Theyre trying too hard to move that vehicle so its probably a flood vehicle or some other massive but easily disguised damage.  A reputable dealership will not ask you to lie to your financial institution.

hmc6ytb,Consistent-Reach-152,11/27/2021,1,The dealer probably inflated the downpayment to make the loan look safer to the bank so the OP would get the loan and the dealer would make the sale.  If you dont want the loan called and made immediately payable dont say anything to the bank.  You should really really inspect the car carefully as the dealer is dishonest.
hm9dzom,ShootinAllMyChisolm,11/27/2021,5,I pay my babysitter  with a check that is generated by my bank. One time it was cashed but not by her. She’s honest. The bank wouldn’t do anything about it. Until I got police involved. I filed a police report and the cop called the bank and wouldn’t you know-resolved in 48 hours.   They had sent it to a local business by accident and that business cashed it. They had to have known all along and/or could’ve looked it up easily.   Go the cop route first. Then escalate to threatening to get your lawyer involved. The latter also has worked for some friends.
hma2f33,sytydave,11/27/2021,1,If you are buying and selling stock each of those transactions are taxable. They are most likely all short term so they would be taxable at your top (margin) tax rate. If you owned them long term the federal tax rate at your combine income level is 0%.
hm9un8h,super_sayanything,11/27/2021,1,Let him compare the scenario and give him the option.
hmbxy6g,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,> Typically you sell your house and have a clause stating you have \~90 days to find a new home so you can roll your mortgage into a new one. Would we need to sell the home my mother gets her $100k and we roll our $200k equity into a new home with the mortgage being the difference in the 90 days period? Am I missing anything else?  This isnt usually the case any more. It will probably just be easiest to sell the house outright pay off the mortgage and get a new mortgage for your new house.
hmavo0q,AdditionalAttorney,11/27/2021,1,Reach out to the tenant advocacy organization for your city or state to ask abt how much they’re allowed to increase rent by.  Some jurisdictions have limits especially w Covid
hmcje0b,phadrus56,11/27/2021,1,No. Doctors quite often change coding to help patients.   With over 80000 codes there is some flexibility.
hmbzfje,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,SWPPX is Schwab’s S&P index fund. VTSAX is entire US market.  If you’re at Schwab and want the entire market SWTSX is their VTSAX equivalent.  However SWPPX is fine and if you’re in a taxable account I would not create a taxable event by switching.
hmcv95r,mantsz,11/27/2021,1,The thing to remember about finances and marriage - especially at your age - is that theres the initial financial impact and then the long-term financial impact to consider. Initially your financial state improves because you consolidate your bills and effectively halve many of them because now youre both pitching into the same pot. This brings a state of perceived financial freedom (comparatively at least). The long-term effect however can be ruinous because in 3-4 years when you realize you got married too young and the other person is no longer the person you fell in love with because theyve grown out of adolescence and into the adult they will be for the rest of their lives you get divorced which ruins your credit and slashes your available income while doubling or in some cases tripling your bills. In the end the best financial advice is just dont get married until youre at least 25 if ever.
hma2c7b,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,Dividends are effectively a forced sale of assets and companies paying dividends are signaling they have nothing better to do with your money than give it back to you.    It’s fine as part of a total market index fund but overweighting dividends (especially when young) isn’t the best strategy since you’re giving up on growth when you ostensibly have a very long time horizon.
hmapkhn,Pemi1099,11/27/2021,1,To me that seems extremely excessive. The arrangement is REALLY simple.   - Home owner: Buys house has name on mortgage. Pays property taxes mortgage maintenance.   - Renter: Pays modest rent maybe 35-40% of PITI or less   Presumably the renter is getting a good deal on rent. Its cheaper for them than it would be to rent an equivalently nice space anywhere. They have no ownership of the space but they get a good deal. Home owner keeps the house and responsibility of the house in the event that they split. You dont need lawyers and contracts for this.   Buying jointly is where this gets messy because you cant both live there when you split but you both legally own the place.
hmbf4xr,thepiece91,11/27/2021,1,If it’s close to the Ice Age Trail they may be interested in purchasing it for trail etc.
hmasw0n,kalli007,11/27/2021,1,Be mindful if you live in a state that recognizes common law marriage - because if you do this can definitely become an issue for litigation down the road. One of my close friends went through this nightmare a year ago arrangement was exactly as you described breakup after a decade and her ex filed divorce claiming common law marriage - attempting to be bought out of the house. Six months and $5k later it was tossed but it was an extremely stressful situation that could have been avoided.
hmb9m1n,wootwoot7120,11/27/2021,1,Exercise for me changed my outlook on life. Getting physically stronger is something everyone should experience in their life before dying.
hmd3z17,Temporary-Ad-1531,11/27/2021,1,Thats still a power imbalance. You pay the mortgage pro rata but are you going to give her a third of the gain if you sell? If the answer is no (which Im sure it is) then its a power imbalance. No matter what you get all the equity gain subsidized by her which makes it unfair.   Im sure it works for some people but not everyone. I know it wouldnt work for me because I suggested this to my now wife when we were dating and she said shed break up with me before agreeing to me buy and her rent from me. I also would not have agreed so we rented an apartment until we got married then bought together
hmbcytg,mercpop,11/27/2021,1,I started being less frugal when I got with my SO. She MADE me dress nicer and I feel more confident. She MADE me buy the expensive ice cream at the grocery store and I havent gone back to the cheap stuff since. Maybe you need someone in your life to push you- a friend family or SO.

hmb1gbo,RonJohn223,11/27/2021,1,None that I can tell what-so-ever.  I would say it’s probably improved my score because I have to take a little more time to un-freeze and think about if I really need that credit.
hmcjg4m,PriBake,11/27/2021,1,I increase the percentage if I am contributing 10 percent and I get a 4 percent raise I usually just add 2 percent so I’d then contribute 12 percent.
hm9aiq8,Unstupid,11/27/2021,2,Join a credit union that includes overdraft protection as well as a line of credit with the checking account.  That way if something would overdraft they can automatically pull from the line of credit.

hmclnt1,DerickJose,11/27/2021,1,I was a victim of fraud recently and if I didnt payed attention to my banking app they wouldve drained my savings and checkings account through Cash app and Zelle I believe your parent.
hm948qc,islangmemes,11/27/2021,1,I always get a loan I know I can easily afford and then make extra payments to pay it off early if I have extra money laying around. This will help account for things such as layoffs or any unexpected financial occurrences.   Ex: I took a 5 year car loan out paid it off in 3.  I took a 30 year mortgage and started making double payments last year when I drastically increased my income.   You won’t see drastic changes to your credit because of the length of the loan you take. Nor will you see that great of a credit improvement for paying it off early. But it will look good going forward to underwriters when they see you’ve paid off loans on time or early with no delinquent payments. That’s why it’s important to make sure loan terms are realistically obtainable. Over committing will only hurt you.
hm9tbh3,Its-a-write-off,11/27/2021,1,50.00 for extra lines is high. Maybe you all need to shop a new plan together. But generally its better financially to all be on one plan.  A credit card is a better way to build credit.
hmcc10g,metalguysilver,11/27/2021,1,Once you have 6-12 months of expenses in savings I wouldn’t put any more in savings unless you’re saving for specific thing (vacation car…). Put a minimum of 15% into retirement more if you can and invest the rest in a brokerage. Sounds like you’re doing pretty well. Look into an HSA too
hmd0pet,theoriginalharbinger,11/27/2021,1,As mentioned the bank has to put money in the account. But they can claw it back when its discovered the instrument is bad. This often results in people going into overdraft.
hm93h80,X-Maelstrom-X,11/27/2021,6,Your W-2 from your old job should tell you how much you made there. Paystubs too  Going into a new tax bracket won’t be a big deal. It’ll only mean the money you make *after* passing into the new bracket will be taxed higher. Not all income for the whole year.
hma06ed,tastygluecakes,11/27/2021,1,Predictor tools are exactly that - tools.  Most assume an average return for your asset allocation.  What isn’t always clear is whether the calculators account for what most people do which is shift to lower yield safer assets as they near retirement.  If the calc assumes you are making 7-9% in the market until the day you retire that’s obviously a huge source of error and underestimating how much you need to contribute.  Try a few calculators and err on the side of caution when planning.    How large is your company?  The high compensation limitations are legit - that’s a stipulation of have a safe harbor compliant plan.  But 6% cap is pretty crappy for a cap most companies “fix” this by making safe harbor compliant contributions to everybody to bring up the average to around 6% which means you can go to 8%.  I’d ask HR what they are doing to bring up the average overall - 4% avg is not a good sign for the average employees retirement savings health.    The purpose of the law is to cap executives to incentivize them to help average employees save more.  Not to penalize high earners.

hmb3am6,eumaximizer,11/27/2021,1,I would like a relatively safe investment. Im just a bit worried about the stock market and unsure of the safety of crypto.com for stablecoin investment.
hmci5pk,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,Stop trying to daytrade etfs over any extended period of time the market trends up and to the right. This day to day market sell off is a great time to buy more the companies inside the etf havent changed and are still solid companies until theyre determined not to be.
hm9lzhx,thentangler,11/27/2021,1,True.. but I don’t like anything where the bank expects a cash flow from you.  I can understand that they require a min deposit $25k $50k etc to make it worth their while but it defeats the purpose of a bank if they expect you to pay them every month just to keep their money…. Things can go south really fast if you can’t make that payment.
hmc19qa,SanPitt,11/27/2021,1,Yes. Marriage is expensive. Especially when the most likely outcome of every single marriage is divorce.
hmbcq68,fiberonebar3,11/27/2021,1,You should try spirolactone again if you did and it didn’t work! I gave it a second try and my big zits come in 1/4 the size and go away real fast.
hmbmuga,lucky_ducker,11/27/2021,1,Rule of thumb is MFJ is almost always the better choice by far. The two main exceptions:  One spouse is on IBR repayment of significant student loans.  The lower income spouse has relatively low income and extremely high itemized deductions (e.g. unreimbursed medical expenses).
hm9368m,applepiecorgi,11/27/2021,1,Look for exclusions part under your liability coverage and it should spell it out for you. [This wesbsite](https://locktonmotorsports.com/personal-auto-policy-guide/) has an example of what it should look like.  Edit - Since you’re OP. Yes to comp because is generally pretty cheap so I mean I would get it. And collision is a good option if you can’t afford to replace the vehicle. Don’t count on you/ your mom never being at fault for an accident or the other party having valid coverage that will cover your vehicle. Lots of people out there don’t have insurance/ don’t have enough insurance to cover all the damage they cause/ tell their insurance company they’re not at fault (which can become an issue for you if they believe their insured over you/ your mom).
hmd6xf7,PrayingMantisMirage,11/27/2021,1,You can always do a review every quarter to see if there are small adjustments youd like to make. That way its less of a stress to get it perfect. Think of it as an iterative process.
hmcn7gy,GenericMelon,11/27/2021,1,I would definitely give your insurance a call to double-check that everythings in order. My grandma was charged for something that shouldve been covered by her insurance I called insurance and they said Oh were just missing the address of the medical facility. It could be as simple as that.  If that route doesnt work you can always call the office that did the EKG and come up with an interest-free payment plan. You may even been able to talk the balance down if you ask.
hm928ut,WafflingToast,11/27/2021,1,Are you factoring in the monthly federal child care credits?  Shouldnt they kick in soon and take the place of your second job?

hmc306s,soldiernerd,11/27/2021,1,Dave Ramsey is great *except* for his insistence on never having credit cards in my opinion. I understand that credit cards are very dangerous if you dont have any self control over spending BUT if you are financially normal/stable there are so many benefits to credit cards paid off every month (ie never paying interest).  * Building your credit score!!!!!! * Reward points/cashback/miles * Price drop protection * Rental car insurance * chargebacks/fraud detection (as compared to a debit card) * Automatic accounting (when linking your credit cards to an online budget tool like mint personal capital YNAB etc
hmcnif4,CCSC96,11/27/2021,1,I’m sorry but you do not understand how marginal taxation works. Only your income beyond a certain dollar amount is taxes at that rate. You probably pay just a little less total because your lower salary cushions the speed at which you reached that combined rate. But either way I’m very sure your effective rate is the same.
hmbay4y,cycling_sender,11/27/2021,1,If its any consolation its more likely that this money will be used to fund other criminal activity than for frivolous spending.
hmalybf,jaredp812,11/27/2021,1,Step -1 stop going deeper into debt to give your fiancée money. You’re borrowing from next month without paying for this month (“not disciplined enough to do” Dave Ramsey isn’t really valid while you’re working up to 96hrs per week. You’re not focusing on finances but you’re plenty disciplined). You didn’t mention what you owe on the house cars other debts or what you are taking home from the job this will determine the specifics of your situation (including if you need to lose the house for now and go back to renting until you stabilize yourself).   Step 0 get focused on finances. Make a budget with every dollar that you expect to make for December planned out to go to something specific. If you need a coat/shoes to make it through winter include that otherwise you need to pay the absolute minimum on every single thing and save up the rest as the beginning of your buffer to protect you from unforeseen circumstances.   Step 1 save 1 or 2 thousand so that there is a little money you won’t have to add to your credit card debt if a 1 or 2 thousand dollar emergency comes up. This is not mathematically optimal it is purely psychological it serves as proof  that the system is working. You’re not merely lowering your debt total you are increasing your net worth. Do not underestimate the power of psychological mechanisms.   Step 2 start paying off all debt but the house. Once your credit cards have been addressed you could revisit the “I pay my fiancee’s bills” plan if you want. Remember fasten your own oxygen mask before assisting others: you won’t be a great spouse if you bring 5 digits of high interest debt into the marriage that you aren’t actively addressing no matter how many dishes you wash or jokes you tell.   Step 3 pay off the house and save up a rainy day fund. The size of the fund will depend on your risk tolerance your job security your life plans etc but the necessity of the fund is nonnegotiable. The average American has a $10k emergency ~once per decade I believe. If you don’t want to be back in this same exact position in 10 years’ time prepare for the emergencies before they happen.   After that the world is your oyster! Wanna save up and get a boat or a new car or stocks&bonds or whatever else under the sun?? Once you pay for food utilities transportation and taxes every other dollar you earn is now funny money!!! Don’t forget you need to plan for retirement unless you trust the government to cover all your expenses (hint: check the birth rate demographics of ~20-40 years before you retire as that is who will be paying those retirement taxes to you). If you have/expect kids and are like most parents you probably want to put something aside for their future beyond what you put aside for your own. Other than that the only thing left for you to do is live a great life without any more financial stress!!  Edited for formatting

hm8v896,StiffHappens,11/27/2021,1,The bank has a record of whether the check was presented for payment. That means if the recipients bank requested payment. Normally that is looking at the image of the back of the check. If you used Chase Bill Pay they sent a paper check to the landlord. If the landlord PHYSICALLY deposited the check you should be able to get an image of the front and back of the check by finding it through the online activity search of your account.  If the landlord deposited the check using their mobile app or a desktop scanning device I dont know if there is a similar image constructed showing the deposit. However Chase does have a record somewhere of paying out the funds through the Federal Reserve to the landlords bank. If they cannot tell you and prove to you that the payment was completed ask them to return the funds to your account.   The primary method of YOU determining if the check was paid is to see where and when on your monthly statement the funds are shown as deducted from your account or as I mentioned above seeing and printing / downloading the image of the check in the online activity of your account.   If you dont get paper statements you can download a pdf from the Chase website. You can also filter all transactions for the amount of the rent payment or filter all payments to the landlord name and pdf that. Then email the pdf to your landlord showing that the payment was made. You can also go to a branch and have an officer do that then stamp it with their official stamp and initial it. Thats legal proof of payment being sent.  If Chase is unwilling to give you a certified record of the transaction tell them youll be complaining to the attorney general for your state AND to their primary regulator (possibly the OCC - Federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.) Youll have to look up the phone / email etc. for both of those.
hmcj310,lemoncashew,11/27/2021,1,Doctors offices mess up in coding things. So do insurance companies. Its why everyone complains about them.   Theres no harm in calling your insurance and doctor to figure out whats happening. Sometimes its a miscommunication. You might end up needing to pay this as part of your deductible. You might not.
hmd9t92,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,1,Start with one. If youre going to be making $500/mo profit your income is now 20% higher. Rinse / repeat until you have the real estate empire youre hoping for.  Honestly when youre talking about $75-100K condos I think your expectations of $500/mo profit is a bit high especially if youre going to be paying a management company. A 30-year mortgage on $85K (5% down) P&I + PMI isnt likely going to be $500/mo.

hmbw4nc,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,> Is there any reason to keep credit cards open when I could just use the T-Mobile account?   Credit cards have spending rewards better consumer protections and build credit.  You should basically never use a debit card unless youre incapable of using credit responsibly.
hmbw3mu,GamerGER,11/27/2021,1,Do you want to marry that early to have a stable surrounding? The few couples I know off that got married so early in life all ended in horrible divorces.  Maybe reflect about why you want to marry your bf. Development wise you got still some growing up in front of you and wont be the same person in 5 years.  Your sister is right about the financial stability part. You get married and pregnant before having any career. this puts you in a way worse spot than he will be especially regarding childcare.
hmaaqlc,nnndude,11/27/2021,1,Depends on what type of debt you’d be inheriting and the financial responsibility of your spouse.   A friend of mine married a guy who had debt and a horrible penchant for spending money they didn’t have. They’ve since divorced and she’ll be paying the financial price for being married to that guy for a while.
hmaxtah,zelephant10,11/27/2021,1,I would build an emergency fund to cover at least 3 months of expenses and/or any unexpected costs that would arise. After that I’d tackle your car loan early and maybe shop around for better insurance rate. 340 a month is very high unless your record is really bad.

hm8vx66,assertivelyconfused,11/27/2021,1,The 3% match is free money.    However 3% of $52k isn’t exactly earth shattering.  The 1% you miss with your fathers strategy is only $520/yr.  You have very little emergency savings.    Your $15k debt isn’t the end of the world but the interest rate is very important on how you choose to proceed.    Finally I think this comes down to your living expenses.  If you’re saving $20k/yr that’s much different than if you’re living paycheck to paycheck  Tldr - no one except maybe your father has enough information to say this is right/wrong.  Interest rate on loans and your living expenses are important variables.  Also 50% match on 2% of 401k contributions is only $540 of free money you miss out on per year.  Depending on your situation (barely breaking even or early career and have potential promotions in excess of $540 in the near term) this may or may not be splitting hairs.
hm9wvfz,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,1,I left about 45k on the table last year to leave my old job. No matter the amount really think of how your emotions will be if you walk away from that money. Ive thought back on it numerous times. However that environment at my old job had gone so toxic and I knew the wheels were falling off so to speak. I remained confident that my new job would be better for my career long term.  In this written agreement you’ve been given is it long term? You could stay and feel out the new roles/responsibilities and give yourself time with the added financial boost.
hmcbat7,WutThEff,11/27/2021,1,Sure but you’ll have the equity in your current home to help offset that.
hmck1bq,as1126,11/27/2021,1,Most mortgage companies will likely tell you that can’t borrow until that is all paid off.

hmb6bdc,frzn_dad,11/27/2021,1,Havent ever run into a not scummy impound lot IRL. Have seen a few on youtube that seem all right but they are recovery companies not impound yards or that is what they show online anyway.
hmadcaq,AsOctoberFalls,11/27/2021,1,Yes $2300 is high IMO. The USDA’s “liberal” grocery budget is $220/week for a family of two adults and a one year old.  I feel we spend a lot on groceries and eating out. We are feeding two adults and a 10 year old and we spend roughly $750/month on groceries and $300/month eating out. I am able to buy pretty much whatever specialty ingredients I want with this budget (although I have noticed that getting more difficult with rising grocery costs lately).

hm8xvby,pocketbookashtray,11/27/2021,1,Call your insurance company.  That’s why you have insurance and they are nearly always extremely helpful.
hmawfle,93195,11/27/2021,1,You can try to negotiate but you don’t have a ton of leverage.  I’m sure they have a lease requirement to notify you of rent increase or non renewal which they just did.  And like you said your lease requirement to provide notice of non-renewal is probably about the same.  Go talk to them Monday but you’ll need to decide soon probably before you can get something else locked in.  Sucks I know.
hma67gi,sozar,11/27/2021,1,I admin other things but the payroll application is what is deemed the most important. I’m expected to know how all of the calculations work on both the payroll and benefit sides and troubleshoot issues as they arise. Because of this I have to know both the payroll and HR rules because of the level of overlap in things like benefits. In a perfect world the payroll and HR departments would also know these things but in my company only the payroll side knows anything and I have to repeatedly teach HR their own policies.
hmcrfl1,Rainbow-Death,11/27/2021,1,I don’t even think I can shame them posting my itemized bill on their feed. It doesn’t seem to have worked before at all. :c

hmaa9ky,ThisIsAMonere,11/27/2021,1,I was on Verizon for 20 years and one day one of those commercials just convinced me to take a peek at T Mobile. Since a phone company cannot legally make you change the phone device you use or the phone number you have to switch anymore and since yearly contracts are a thing of the past I decided I’d try it for a month and switch back if I wasn’t satisfied.  Prior to switching I was paying about $100 for one line I believe. I now pay $110 for unlimited for 2 lines and that comes with free Netflix and free MLB TV both of which my husband and I had been paying for before we switched.  It’s at least $1500 a year in savings since we switched.  Try it out if the service is decent in your area! T mobile May very well be the best provider out there right now. (I don’t work for T mobile I promise).

hm9sxqh,nouseforanametoday,11/27/2021,1,If I was you I would not work the part-time job and instead try to apply for every type of benefit you qualify for.   Maybe work as a babysitter instead of your part-time job. You will get paid in cash and under the table. It will help you qualify for benefits and get a lite extra spending money.
hmbf9qi,joemetarei,11/27/2021,1,Just set it to autopay in full whenever it is due so you don’t have to worry about it
hmalf9a,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,Houses are not a sure thing either. Thats an illusion.   Has real estate--specifically single family homes--performed somewhat predictably over the past 100 years? Yes.   Has the stock market performed somewhat predictably over the past 100 years? Yes.   Can you find a period of 5 10 20 30 years where SFH has been a better investment than the broad stock market? Starts with yes (ie yes but not common) but ends up no. Furthermore the probability weighs heavily towards investing winning out even over shorter periods.   Owning a home has other liabilities other than the buying/selling price: 1. Very illiquid. Doesnt matter how much its worth if its expensive/difficult to take advantage of. 2. Literal liability. Someone falls in your house/yard? Get sued. 3. Financial liability. Mold roofs termites ice dams sewage systems fire etc. 4. Opportunity cost. Having a house means keeping a larger e-fund money that will garner ~0% this on top of above discussion.  TLDR: houses are NOT a sure thing.
hmbni4j,RobertKesselring,11/27/2021,1,Its highly unlikely theyll ever ask for the money back.
hmd41bl,_slocal,11/27/2021,1,I’m shocked every time I see people worrying about house prices that low. Seems like y’all are on a different planet. Most people around here (SoCal) make about the same and are buying $750k houses. And yet they make it work.
hmbifv4,2021istrash,11/27/2021,1,The problem isnt the wedding its that you will also want a baby or accidentally  get pregnant. Then you will have to stay at home caring for the baby and you will be baby trapped. Why? Because right after college and a few years after you probably wont make much money and you will be fully depending on your husband making money and therefore be trapped financially. No woman or man should ever be trapped that way unable to leave a bad relationship because of money  Everyone should have a certain degree of financial freedom before and during the marriage. Sure once can take 6mo maternity leave and rely on them for a bit but realistically your career wont take off right after college and getting married and much less is having a baby early on.  Also its nice to have some savings for emergencies in case one of you falls sick and for proper vacations. If you want to ruin a marriage fast being broke and having a baby early on are the easiest ways to do this.
hmcsco4,newbeginingshey,11/27/2021,1,By orderly I believe you mean long and expensive and potentially dangerous? An unmarried woman can grab her things change her passwords change her name and never speak to her abuser again. A married woman can’t do that.
hmci9ql,BastidChimp,11/27/2021,1,Have him use no annual fee credit cards for essential purchases like food and gas. Pay it off every month should help his credit score as well as pay down any of his debts. Pay off your student loan asap. Dont wait for the freeze to end.
hmbag6p,Orangesunset98,11/27/2021,1,Maybe pay for the groceries you use and a portion of the rent/mortgage. Make sure to have this in writing! Ideal savings should be ~30% (if possible this would be optimal but I cant even afford that I do 20%) including investments and emergency fund (6 months worth of the money you use for necessary expenses)   Good luck!!

But honestly if we both werent in a place where we could afford to do it we would both be happy with the 60$ city hall route.  It can be as expensive or inexpensive as you want. Its about you and how you want it.

hmb9p3k,IblinkfanA,11/27/2021,1,Not to hijack OP’s thread but something here doesn’t add up when I apply this to my situation.   I’ve been using the calculator at this link:  https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator  I’m 28 years old and by this time next year I plan to have roughly $50k in retirement.  Using the calculator linked assuming no more contributions and 10% interest that says I’ll have $2.7m in 42 years.   However with your math if I double it 6 times (6x7=42 years + 28 years old =70) I get $3.2m.   That’s nearly half a million difference between the two calculations?
hmcyojp,Key-Emu5781,11/27/2021,1,My original question was how to talk down a bill as this was what was recommended to me. Thanks for being condescending though
hm9mgt9,Signal_Icy,11/27/2021,1,Well I can’t borrow because there’s no local library here but I’ll try to see if I can borrow online. One book (the richest man in Babylon is very cheap and I have enough funds to buy it and order it rn but I’ll check the online library thanks for that tip. I can’t actually switch Korean books because it will just make it more complex for me. The course of books I chose is very easy for me to understand and it would be a bother if I changed books now. They also offer exercises and they have a YouTube channel if I ever need help with the books. And they sell the exclusively in Korea but through Shopee I can get them with a discount. The books also contains links to audio resources so that’s that.

hm9iwha,HarmoniousJ,11/27/2021,2,Regular savings if its something trivial like less than a year but really if you go regular savings theres no drawback to an HYA.  If longer than a year look at a bond (Or HYA savings if you still need a bit more liquidity)

hmahjb1,iranisculpable,11/27/2021,1,The 1.1 and 0.1 comes from the sp500 having historic annual total returns of 10 percent.    16 comes from age 68 - 52.    The stuff to the  left of the  plus sign is how $200K grows in 16 years.   The stuff to the right of the plus sign is the sum of a geometric series  which answers the question: “if I invest the same amount each year and the investment grows by the same percentage how much will I have after N years.”  17 is one more than 16 because that is how the sum of geometric series works.    20500 is the 2021 maximum 401k contribution
hmbubzp,123456478965413846,11/27/2021,1,Check with your insurance company and see if you have uninsured motorist coverage.  In some states this is standard in addition to liability coverage.  Since it sounds like the guy that hit you might not be insured this would fix your car if you have it.  Whether you are going to be able to claim this under insurance or not you need to get the car out ASAP.  You have a duty to mitigate so not getting the car out of the tow lot could leave you on the hook for storage fees if insurance pays out.  And if insurance doesnt cover it you still owe those fees and the tow yard will sell your car at auction or for scrap and come after you for anything still owed on storage fees you come out ahead getting your car out and scrapping it yourself if its that bad.
hmd56e8,johnIQ19,11/27/2021,1,but why not when employee buy the things then the employee send the exact amount in the check so no remaining balance? And if it is anything like program or thing like that employer should just buy it and give to the employee. I see no sense for any reason that the employee need to pay.
hmd306n,grassisgreen3711,11/27/2021,1,That is what is concerning to me. My score dropped from a 770 to a 745 from this small balance. I have tried applying for unsecured cards but always got rejected so went the secured card route when I graduated about a year ago.   I am not going to have any issues with getting approved. I have plenty of savings no debt and a good income. I’d just like to get a better rate with a better credit score. The drop happened on my equifax and transunion score

hmcvhjh,SpecialLlama,11/27/2021,1,As others have said you can certainly do a Roth conversion on the full balance of the rollover IRA and pay the taxes on the conversion which may or may not be substantial depending on how much is in the rollover IRA.  I wanted to add one thing.  The Build Back Better bill as passed by the House will take away the option of doing backdoor Roth conversions.  This still has to go through the Senate and this may or may not get changed during that process.  But if it stays you only have until December 31 of this year to contribute after tax dollars to the traditional and do the Roth conversion.  Something to keep an eye on for future reference.

hmccu9p,brutlyuth,11/27/2021,1,Is your future spouse financially responsible? Do they have a lot of debts theyre not actively paying down an inability to budget too many credit cards with high balances always wondering where the money they make has gone? If theyre unwilling to let you know everything in advance even if they used to have a problem that theyve overcome (which often comes from growing up in a financially irresponsible family) it will become an issue in your marriage. On the positive if youre completely on the same page financially and stay that way then the only expensive thing will be a big wedding (unless you can get your family to pay for it...or elope).

hmawalj,Icy-Regular1112,11/27/2021,1,I tend to agree with your sister but not for the same reasons exactly. People change a LOT between 22 and 32. Sometimes you can get married and change together in the same way(s) and sometimes you change and move apart. I generally recommend getting into your 30s before getting married or buying a house for that reason. Flexibility and the ability to grow into yourself and your career is important. For example if you get offered your dream job across the country and your spouse has their dream job already it can really hurt your finances (and your life satisfaction) because someone has to sacrifice their full potential.   Sharing expenses being married assuming both parties are on the same page and have good earnings will ultimately yield financial benefits (mostly by paying half on fixed costs like utilities and rent) but marrying young can have real downsides to career and growth opportunities.

hmb8ym1,alto-sun,11/27/2021,1,I have but have not found anything that really works yet. Ive gotten tired of spending money on expensive products that have harsh side effects (some of which left even worse scars) and having my skin inspected and I feel ashamed that its gotten so bad over time.  I guess this is probably outside the realm of PF. But its just an example of something I refused to spend money on and had snowballing consequences.
hmapw9h,spoonraker,11/27/2021,1,Thats not what DCA is either.  DCA just means taking investable funds you already have and intentionally spreading the investment out over a period of time. Thats it. It doesnt matter what you invest in what the price is or even what the period of time is or the number of installments DCA just means you have money to invest now but youre intentionally not putting it all in the market right away and instead are spreading the investment out over some period of time.  Imagine I gave you $1M right now to invest.  If you take that $1M and immediately invest it all thats a lump sum investment. Not DCA.  If you decided to invest 1/24th of it monthly over the next 2 years thats DCA.  If you decided to invest 1/12 of it monthly over the next year thats still DCA.  If you did 1/3 of it monthly over the next 3 months thats still DCA.  If you did half now and half in a year thats still DCA.  DCA just means you have the funds now but intentionally spread investing those funds over time.  Also its worth understanding that DCA is *not* an effective strategy for... basically anything.  DCA produces worse returns on average and it doesnt meaningfully reduce risk over the long term.  DCA does reduce risk *during the period of time in which youre investing* however that term should hopefully be relatively short compared to the overall time in the market. DCA either guarantees you miss out on a lot of time in the market or that you dont actually reduce risk much in the long run. This is why its not really good for anything.  Its also worth understanding that investing in multiple different index funds that are basically identical doesnt do much of anything either.  You seem a bit worried about risk so think of it like this:  1. Invest everything now dont wait waiting gains you nothing but 2. Reduce risk based on your risk tolerance by buying less risky funds with some percentage of your investable assets  Anything in the stock market is relatively risky even index funds. So if youre worried about the risk of index funds maybe buy some bonds in proportion with how much of that principal youre not willing to risk.  So for example: take 80% of your funds and dump it all into VTI right now then take the other 20% and dump it all into something like VBTLX right now.  That way youre not wasting your time playing mental tricks on yourself with DCA but youre still protecting 20% of your principal by investing in much less volatile assets. Hell hold some of it in cash if you want. Especially if you dont already have a sizable emergency fund.
hmb74a3,kbecaobr,11/27/2021,1,80 year olds are not dementes invalids like you seem to think. Having health issue does not mean your life sucks. People still enjoy the outdoors family time go out with their SO make new friends at church or whatever hobby you have. Im a physician and I have seen hundreds of elderly patients in my job and I assure you MANY elderly (80+) live very fulfilling lives with family and friends around them. My wifes grandparents are perfect examples of that but I wont make my point on anecdotes. Maybe you should read more about life after 80 instead of assuming based on your family circumstances and personal bias.
hma12j0,yeah87,11/27/2021,1,Also worth noting that this type of mortgage insurance becomes less valuable as time goes on because your payoff price goes down over time. Its generally advisable to simply get a standalone life or disability insurance product.
hm9rhiw,dleskov,11/27/2021,1,Is not early retirement exactly trading money for time? Or in other words stopping selling time for money?
hmc2bqw,anthonyp17,11/27/2021,1,Yes the $15 NQs are older. Nothing expires until 2029 and 2030.   Glad you brought up AMT that has thrown me for a loop in the past. My salary is $72000 -- so essentially the AMT exemption. Does that help make sense of my situation?  Ignoring AMT considerations total cost of ISO exercise would be $36k...wish I had that kind of cash to throw around but I dont...I worry that cash put toward these ISOs only exposes me deeper to this one company versus putting that cash in my personal brokerage in broad-market funds while -- one day -- doing a cashless exercise using the ISOs to buy and sell the ISOs.  Doing a little bit of the ISOs every year could be more palatable. Ive only exercised and held about 300 of them which I did last tax year so I still have time this year to do more.

hmbf4oq,SolutionLeading,11/27/2021,1,Does your current leasing agreement require a 60-day notice? Check your leasing agreement and local laws too and see if the apartment notified you in a timely way about the rent increase. They may have broken the law by telling you so last minute?
hmaj7ob,PhdJohnald,11/27/2021,1,Wisconsin has very stringent build permitting laws - 75 feet from any water system is considered no build generally.
hmabbc1,Go4MECO,11/27/2021,1,Absolutely this. Communication is key to make this work. Doesn’t have to be more expensive!
hmc3t9g,nothlit,11/27/2021,1,This will depend on your employers policies. You cant contribute 100% of your paycheck because some amount still needs to be reserved to pay your FICA taxes and any other payroll deductions like health insurance etc. You might be able to contribute the remainder to the 401k but some employers will set an even lower limit.
hmb1i78,tony_boxacannoli,11/27/2021,1,Not knowing where you are located...I cant offer much on the time-line - but lets assume it is correct as your lease actually ends on February 7 well beyond 60 days.   Your options are to accept new terms or refuse new terms.   You could try and negotiate better terms...how were you as a tenant? On time every month? Report any maintenance issues before they became a problem? etc. These factors a LL might consider.  If you decide to refuse the terms you have 2 options: move...dont move.   You have a lot of time from now until Feb. 7 to find a place if you opt to not accept new terms and move.   If you decide to not accept new lease terms AND not move...depending on your State...things could get very complicated and expensive.
hmc09ny,redditornot02,11/27/2021,1,Your father is charging you too little for car insurance.   At 23 you should have your own car insurance. If I were him I’d charge you $500 a month that way you learned your lesson.
hmc3zy8,Ika_bunny,11/27/2021,1,Yeah I could tell you were oldish in the first line this advice is no longer sound in the current market year and a half ago I bought a house and made over 60k when we had to move again. We moved across the country and bough a house right away.   To be honest the house we sold we wouldn’t had been in our budget a year later that’s how crazy prices are. OP would probably be better getting a house that is more expensive but with no projects (material prices are thru the roof and contractors are 6months out at best)  There were this houses down the road they started at middle 200k and by the time I sold my house those houses were advertising mid 300k  my house value shoot over 100k (after taxes and all the stuff you have to pay we got about 60-70k in our pocket)
hmaj58c,arcanepsyche,11/27/2021,1,Thanks! He has suggested we try to buy together. I have good income a bit too much debt and a fair credit score. He has no debt an excellent credit score and barely any income. Its just a funky situation.
hmbs262,justinhigley,11/27/2021,1,https://tools.finra.org/retirement_calculator/ is going to have a lot of options you may not necessarily need but it does include an inflation rate and the option to increase deposits accordingly
hmc72qm,kdfn,11/27/2021,1,Yeah I think that this will only pay off significantly if you see serious appreciation. The leverage will help with that but I think an annual appreciation averaging 4% or so for at least a decade would make this worth it. Stocks would return more technically but with a low down payment you magnify returns until you pay it off  The rent seems not so profitable in my opinion it takes the same amount of work to manage a 1k rental as a 2k rental but your profit is so much higher at the higher price point.  Agree with the other posters that the rent to price ratio looks good but thats only because the price is super low
hm9p3cz,retroPencil,11/27/2021,1,Call your bank and say “someone stole my money.” Your bank will tell you next steps.  You willingly let your friends have your debit card info and Social Security number? You will want to freeze your credit. You can look into this in the sidebar for fraud.
hm9xvbj,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,1,Capital One Venture Card. 2 miles for every dollar spent. The app is super easy to use and maintain. Also booking trips flights and hotels is easy within the app. Customer service with them has been fantastic as well. I have heard good things about some Amex cards but i’m very happy with my  Venture card. Plus its a metal card which i just like because it has more weight to it.

hmb5jz4,VegasOldPerv,11/27/2021,1,The answer is yes paying this will affect your credit negatively.   Right now the debt is too old to be on your credit report. If you pay it then you restart the 7 year reporting statute. Which means you could suddenly have a >90 past due on your credit report and your score will drop precipitously.   If you feel obligated to pay this old debt contact the debt holder and make a deal in writing that the debt and payment will not be reported to any of the credit bureaus. they have no reason to not accommodate since as others have pointed out they have no legal way to coerce or force payment of this debt unless you reside in one of the nine states that allow for collection of debt longer than the 9 years that have passed.

hmbw95b,ur2cdanger,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for a great response. As you mentioned just straight up mentioning that the RSUs are not enough compared to market rate would be better. I like the company and the position but not desperate to join them at any cost. If things didnt go well so be it. Like you said it is a big gamble and I really dont want to get enticed by doubling or troubling of stock price talks from the recruiter. Ive heard of stories of very less returns from the IPO exist talking in terms of time value of money.
hmd6dus,ghostboytt,11/27/2021,1,You havent actually done the math youre not gonna net $500 or $1000. Things break in a house youll have to shell the money out for those. What if you dont get a tenant for a few months? Your mortgage is still due. Even worse what if you get a tenant doesnt pay rent and refuses to move out? Can you afford a lawyer or the time for court appearances?

hm9obtg,raika11182,11/27/2021,10,If it were me Id pull from the stocks. Yeah the taxes are gonna hurt but with a regular stock portfolio theyre going to hurt no matter when you sell. But the whole point of investing in stocks was to have more money in the end and liquidating those assets to put a down payment on a house is a pretty reasonable balance. Why have $115k in stocks if youre never ever ever ever gonna use that money?  Id leave the Roth alone because you dont pay taxes on those gains if withdrawn at retirement age.  Also break out the calculator and find out how much PMI is. Theres a chance that enduring PMI for an undersized down payment for a while might cost you less money in the long run!
hmbbq1s,Vincent_Gambini_JD,11/27/2021,1,Over the years Ive had accounts with Chase Ally PNC and CapitalOne. At the time I had PNC (~2 years ago) they had by far the worst website and apps and it wasnt even close. Otherwise theyre pretty similar.

Your credit score has dropped substantially** > > Credit card issuers periodically review your account and personal information. If it spots a change it doesn’t like — such as a significant drop in your credit score — it can raise the interest rate on a card you already have.  > However this is a case in which the Card Act requires that you get 45 days notice of the change. Also the rate applies only to new purchases — not your existing balance. If you choose not to accept the change you have the right to close your account with no penalty (provided you pay off the outstanding balance).  > If your rate goes up because of a drop in your credit score your issuer is required to review your account in six months for signs of improvement. If your score goes back up the issuer must consider reducing your rate.

hm9vk8l,briinde,11/27/2021,1,Normally the return on paying down the mortgage isn’t worth it mathematically. But it can be from a peace of mind standpoint.  But in your case if you do this and can get rid of PMI faster the return is even greater. What’s the house worth and how much do you owe? How much principal gets taken off each month?

hmb6dwy,financial-jaguar,11/27/2021,1,Youre 50 so when do you plan on retiring?  Whats the growth on the investments? I assume its more than the rate on the mortgages. Id pay off neither if thats the extent of your liquid asserts (6 months + 200k).  For the investment property the mortgage allows you to write off the mortgage interest. It helps lower the tax burden of the property. For the primary residence even if youre taking the standard deduction the rate is low enough that you are better off letting your 200 k grow in the investment account. To simplify if youyour 200k is growing a 8% and the mortgage is at 3% youre still coming out ahead by 5%. On the other hand if you pay off the loan thats it. The most that money worked for you is that 3% interest you didnt have to pay... And youve lost the intangible of having a larger amount of liquid funds.

hmby4fr,Claffstar,11/27/2021,1,Is marriage expensive? No.  Life is expensive.  Weddings CAN be expensive.  I would at a minimum make sure I had a few basic needs in place before I got married though.

Nothing wrong with making sure you can live with someone before you marry them.

hmb4rvl,Papicloses,11/27/2021,1,I think often times we are all skewed to thinking that 20% down is the only way to go. FHA you can put 3.5% down or Conventional you can go 3% or 5% minimum down to get into a home. We are seeing clients wanting to get into homes to build wealth by using the minimum down payment requirements and then refinancing down the road to take off PMI to make additional wealth moves.

hmcsbrd,mrhuddlebucket,11/27/2021,1,When my wife and I married we combined everything. Is that the right thing to do? Who knows but it worked for us.  Marriage only really gets expensive if you and your significant other aren’t in step with one another.  Are one of you a saver and one of your a spender? Are both of you spenders? Are both of you savers?  My wife and I are savers. We have kids we expect to put through college and make sure they grow up with more than what we had and we can do that by putting our needs aside and saving. If either of you are spenders this can create conflict with joint finances. Most couples I know parents and in-laws included have at least one spender and happy couple is not the term I would use to describe any of them.  Make sure you’re aligned on your financial needs and goals before marrying or it will become expensive either by one of you wanting a certain lifestyle or one of you wanting out when it’s realized that these types of habits may not be so easily changed.
hmb4e8u,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,Marriage can also be used to shield assets by transferring them into the other spouses name.  (Obviously depending on state laws and all that)

hmcsues,ronald_mcdonald_4prz,11/27/2021,1,No you missed my point. They aren’t married. So they don’t have a combined income. You don’t buy a house or make a big purchase if you aren’t married.  Once they are married who cares how they run their finances.

hmac086,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,In a 15+ year time horizon taking risk is what investors are compensated for. With a historical spread of 5.2% real global equity returns verses 1-2% real average home appreciation the compensation is absolutely worth the risk. In the case of an individual home the variance is much higher. Besides OP has liquid funds in the form of emergency funds two incomes and stocks in a taxable brokerage.   Owning a single home is a risk due to the risks of credit real estate sector country city and individual property risk. You dont get those uncompensated specific risks with a globally diversified portfolio of stocks. A medium sized natural disaster you arent insured for would knock a global index down perhaps 5% and a home down 100%.  Paying down a mortgage is equivalent to buying a bond that pays the mortgage interest rate. Why would any young person planning for the long term want to buy such a low yielding asset?
hmdait1,alto-sun,11/27/2021,1,Thank you all for the kind responses and suggestions.  I feel less alone hearing that some of you have been through this as well.

hmd4gml,corradovrt,11/27/2021,1,i had something similar happen but the gas company just ate it after i had 1 talk with them.  had gas for oven and water heater heat was oil.  they very rarely came and checked the meter.  my gas bill was always minimal.  bought a new furnace and switched that to gas as well.   had 2 gas leaks after furnace install both at the meter 1 was on my side other was on gas company side... that 1st winter since they werent checking my meter and it was estimated i paid about $150 for heat.  they came out in the spring and checked the meter i got a letter from them saying meter reading was way higher then estimate and i was going to owe the difference called them and told them i had the gas leak and they had it on record. turns out they were supposed to install a wireless transmitting reader on the gas meter a few years prior and had never done it so since they couldnt prove the gas leak wasnt the cause of the high readings they just ate it.  but about 4 days later they came and installed the wireless device on the meter
hmae3gh,Wahoo2K8,11/27/2021,1,Moving the vehicle won’t impact the claim.  However do you have any independent evidence showing the other driver ran the red light?  Without that then the other insurer denying liability is a real possibility.
hmcolk1,terpischore761,11/27/2021,1,Vanguard is like this as well.   I think it’s because you can buy fractions of mutual fund shares and you have to buy whole shares of ETFs.   So in my SEP IRA. I have automated mutual fund purchases set up. I’m not able to do that in my brokerage account where I have mostly ETFs.
hmbfoz1,throwaway43234235234,11/27/2021,1,Nuke the car loans and other debt asap and maintain your vehicles so they last and youre not swapping out unnecessarily when youre bored.Then try to max the other tax advantaged accounts. You can always lower them if you find it crippling but this is a nice way to put the squeeze on yourself in a good place if you feel like youre being wasteful. Crank that 401k % withholding up a pct or two beyond the employer match. Its still tax advantaged. It sounds like you already diversify so continue to contribute any leftover funds to brokerages etc.Lifestyle creep happens when youre wasteful with your money rather than smart.  Buy higher quality things that last instead of cheaper ones that break isnt creeping if they last and make your life better.  Plan a nice trip with a budget and feel like youve got a milestone or something out of it. Make it a semi-local one if you want to be thrifty but youve done well and earned the right to have some nice things. Just dont be ridiculous about it because youre not rich yet and itll go just as quick as you start realizing how enabling disposable income can be.  Is it creep if you splurge and spend a night out on the town every once in awhile to enjoy time with your friends/family? no. Doing it weekly without a budget? yes.  Depending how much to spend on house/projects you can always find yourself wishing for more.  Source: Bought a 300k house on 130k in income.Equivalent rental would be 1500-2500 atthe time now its 2500+. Rent keeps climbing.  Mortgage was 1700/mo tax/ins/escrow fixed for 30yrs (tax portion increases yearly)   \+ 500mo/ sewer/water/trash/elect/gas\~ utilities.   \+ 500/mo at least in seasonal projects/fixes/repairs/painting/etc.       (Add up all the projects and little parts and pieces you spent to get it done and then /12. You can save a lot here but also spent a ton real quick buying dumb stuff like trashcans and planters.
hm9o1pk,Little_Vermicelli125,11/27/2021,2,Federal government pension is very high and inflation protected.  In other words it will probably be close to $5000 a month next year.  Im honestly not sure there is much reason to invest as long as his wife continues getting his pension in the event he dies first.  Since its enough money to live well on.  Id maybe suggest betterment or wealth front or sigfig.  Go with a conservative account.  Or just get him some target date 2020 funds (or whenever he retired) through vanguard.
hmbh1by,MFSHou,11/27/2021,1,I always recommend downloading your insurance carrier app to your device. Most of the insurers have one.  It’s the most convenient way to access everything related to your plan from ID cards EOBs provider and prescription lookups etc etc.
hmbwhtw,sevoiso,11/27/2021,1,Yeah. Makes sense. If the realtor adds nothing though I would rather give to you family.
hmcxaw3,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,The most commonly recommended companies are Vanguard Schwab and Fidelity I have one of these three but they are very similar if not quite identical.    Each one offers more options than one person can comprehend and naturally tends to favor its own funds but only slightly. The difference is between zero commission and very low commission. Id almost say pick the one with the tools and interface that are most understandable to you.
hmakhm0,wild_b_cat,11/27/2021,1,VTI is sufficient for US stocks. If you want international exposure add VXUS or something like that.   Also if you’re not holding back money today you’re not doing DCA. You’re just regularly investing.

hmcsny7,colterlovette,11/27/2021,1,You are conflating things. A lien is placed on a property for a debt an individual owns. The property doesn’t actually hold the account the person still does. A lien just gives them rights to extract their value from the equity of the asset if/when the individual won’t/can’t pay.   In this case the prior individual doesn’t own the asset and a lien wasn’t filed before the asset was sold to the now current owner (a different individual). If it was the lien would have absolutely been brought up during finance and titling.   So no I’m not wrong. :)  I.e: a “thing” cannot own a financial arrangement. A person does. You have never seen a utility company have an account that belongs to an asset and not a person. Ever.
hmcu7w9,Agroskater,11/27/2021,1,I’d imagine anything that you simply can’t point to and say “I’d like that” without some complication involved meaning paperwork or installation or something along those lines. Like washer/dryer dishwasher fridge etc.

hmcbprn,sunsoutbunzout,11/27/2021,1,Check with your lender and see if they do “skip pays”. During the holidays some lenders will let you skip a month or two for a small fee as long as you’re current. It could buy you a little time.
hmafdmb,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Did the agency say where your account went?   Did they close it out as settlement broke... Or perhaps accidentally closed as settlement paid?  Yes call GM.  See if GM will honor the original terms of the settlement and not make you start over with a new settlement.  You already reset your statue of limitations when you paid the first penny towards settlement. Not a big deal as long as you finish the settlement.

hmaf5f5,zludderz4707,11/27/2021,1,I’m actually hopping from my financed Hyundai with a blown engine at the moment (that Hyundai wants to fight tooth and nail not to fix even on recall) to Honda for that specific reason the residual value and quality of Hondas in general. My brother had a 2018 Civic hatchback sport leased at a great deal and just ended his lease term last month which is what put me on the idea of choosing Honda with their proven service.  They showed me my credit score of 623 (TransUnion and I wasn’t happy to see it either hence cosigner supporting a 720 score and much better income) and presented me a payment of $474/mo without cosign this is with the 2022 Honda Civic EX at a 12K/36 month lease and my $500 down. I was expecting around $450-500/mo so I was aware of that high water boundary nonetheless merely due to my credit score. This was fine enough for me because it’s still within my means and serving definite purpose the car itself.   From myself walking in to leaving the lot with signed papers was around 2 hours and they did provide all of the money factors in that time. I’ve informed my cosigner of what is at hand in the moment so if they have to step in upon renegotiation then shall it be in that assumption.   Some people might laugh at that price tag but the idea was to stretch away from my unreliable very used vehicles that are costing me just as much and launch my budget towards something more trustworthy and continuously brand new - so I thank you for the information regarding the possibility of ending lease early for a better price point because I hope to use this as a ladder to obtain such eventually.

hmd01qo,boogi3woogie,11/27/2021,1,Pay off your credit cards. It’s not clear if you can even afford a house. You seem like you’re living paycheck to paycheck.  You will survive in an apartment. Toss out all your junk to make space. My wife and I lived in a one bedroom with a baby for 4 years before we upgraded to a house that was 5x bigger.  Yes housing prices seem to still be going up but jumping in when you don’t have the income isn’t the solution. You need to increase your income and drop your cost of living.

hmbk131,PileofScrabbleTiles,11/27/2021,1,Yup just a discussion although the new account would start getting our monthly savings contributions.  We just moved into a new home this May and had to dip into the fund two weeks after buying when the 20 year old washer leaked into our first floor ceiling. Needless to say that scared us a bit so I think well go with the two accounts one for legit savings the other for easy access.  Thanks for the help!

hmcfp9v,Silentlystrode,11/27/2021,1,At the point youre at Id generally be suggesting you look to always move up in salary. Theres times when you move down especially when very senior and making trade offs but early in your career most job changes should be moving you up.
hm9twcl,Its-a-write-off,11/27/2021,1,Whats the total cost of the plan a month? How many financed phones? With 1 or 2 financed phone the total monthly payment should be around 200.00. But removing 1 paid off phone line wont reduce it by 50.00 as the basic plan is likely to be 120.00 or so and each extra line 10 or 20.

hmckv5h,joemetarei,11/27/2021,1,Just use it for normal things like groceries gas etc and pay off in full. Never have to pay interest and builds credit slowly eventually you can ask for a limit increase. I would also look to open a couple more to build history on several accounts. Same applies to those.
hmbtidl,SuchLovelyLilacs,11/27/2021,1,I found that marriage benefitted me financially since it effectively doubled my household income overnight! That said I found out my husband still had $35K in student loans to pay off when we got engaged (I had $0 - mine were already paid). I told him those needed to be 100% paid off before the wedding. It took some sacrifices on his part but he had them paid off in full about three months before the wedding. That wasnt debt I was willing to take on.   How marriage plays out financially is really situation-dependent. My advice is to always have your own money accessible only to you. Its just good sense in case theres an emergency or things go sideways for some reason. My good friend worked in banking for years and there were too many times that a couple on the brink of divorce had one spouse come clean out the account leaving the other one high and dry. You never want to be in that situation. *Always* have emergency funds in an account *only* in your name.
hmd7mrg,Stable-McCafe,11/27/2021,1,Out of curiosity have you checked for something similar on carvana or any similar buying services? I wonder how large of a price difference it is in your area from a dealership.  Negotiations are hard in this market bud. Dont set your heart on a specific model. Shop around for similar models if you wanna be able to walk away from a negotiation if you dont feel like it by the end.

hm9j8jp,FN2187_JEDI,11/27/2021,2,>It’s funny to me when wealthy people are “terrified” over money matters.

Regardless its easy for you to criticize what you dont understand.

hmbsbiq,imitation_crab_meat,11/27/2021,1,This is one time it pays to be. If you were male youd pay more.  Would your dad care if you got your own insurance? Youre an adult... Assuming you live with him he would likely need to exclude you from his insurance explicitly which means youd be unable to drive his car(s) but all that takes is a call to the insurance company to do its pretty routine.
hmaxum7,OhMyGodTheyKilledBri,11/27/2021,1,I’d disagree tbh. An emergency fund is intended for emergencies meaning they shouldn’t be needed but once every 2-3 years. The penalty for withdrawals from a 401k is 10%. The rough math says put the money in the retirement account and if you really absolutely need it pay the penalty. In most cases you can borrow it as a loan without paying the penalty. Unless you’re using emergency funds more than once a year you’re losing money watching it decay in a bank account. As far as the loan debts move from highest risk to lowest risk.
hmcwb2n,lightnglass,11/27/2021,1,I think it is important to save money for your future however like some others have stated you need to ask yourself what are you saving for?  Also if you arent able to enjoy some minor luxuries now to make your quality of life better now what is the point?  You have to make yourself happy now (to an extent) because theres no guarantee you even will have tomorrow - so buy that skin cream buy a new shirt maybe look into a slightly better housing situation.   If you start making these small moves you will be comfortable seeing that you arent going broke by doing that and youre still able to save money for the future.

Thanks a lot for helping me better understand!
hmbuqqi,simpkill,11/27/2021,1,This is not financial advice.  I would probably put most of that into a savings account.  Probably 5 months worth of living expenses to cover your ass for bad times should they unfortunately arise.  If 20k doesnt cover that then work up to it. Not sure what your current retirement fund is but I suggest you start thinking of that as well if you havent already.  Good luck.
hmd15qr,Daxime,11/27/2021,1,Unfortunately not enough choice.

hmco96b,not_a_moogle,11/27/2021,1,I said it elsewhere but at 22/21 youre still figuring out your life/career and you will be very different people at 25 and very different from that around 30.    life up until that point changes a lot very rapidly and your perception of things is very different. Odds are the person you are at that age and the person youre with will not be the same people 5-10 years.  Theres a naivety to it that I cant easily put into words.

hmanpvc,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,Its not that its a bad house but it needs work that we arent willing to put into it. Its a tiny ranch with a soldiers kitchen no attic and no basement. She wants to sell it while were in a good market for selling and people are buying houses that need work. Not to mention that anything she wants to do to fix up the house before selling it is currently on her and not us financially. We want to expand our family in the next few years to have another child and feel like it would be better to move now when the burden of fixing and selling this house is not on us than to have to fix a ton of stuff in the house over the next few years on our dime and then try to sell it. Shes also made the comment once or twice of not wanting to sell it to us because she doesnt think its a good family home. Living here comes with the additional con of slightly toxic mother in law This was my house and I expect you to upkeep it in the same way I would have comments and arguments (which for the record we work hard to maintain a clean house with 3 animals and a baby and my mother in law could find a speck of dust and berate us for not keeping things clean to her standards). I know if we bought the house that technically wed have the argument that it is no longer her house but shes the type who will still make the comments and its not something either of us want to deal with.  If push came to shove and this was our only option there would be worse fates than buying this house. But theres a long list of reasons we do not want to buy this house and have to deal with the inevitable issues that will need repair before we could sell it again.
hma5wbk,iDontWantAUsernameYo,11/27/2021,1,Good luck bub for real. I know it gets stressful and I know I aint really helping you out here but I know this can really mess people up in their head. You got this man.

hmbm17e,realgamerperry,11/27/2021,1,Might be worth keeping it for a few years see if anyone wants to develop it over the next decade or so. $25 yearly property tax isnt that much just to speculate.

hmb2cly,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/27/2021,1,Make sure it’s the right person and you really want to spend the rest of your life together and grow old together.  Otherwise shortly after college is not a big deal.  We got married when we were your age we are happily married decades later.   Having a common understanding of finances is important as is having a common understanding of other important aspects of your lives like whether to have kids your values etc.  Your understanding of whether to fully join finances or keep them relatively separate (eg joint vs separate bank accounts) would be pretty important.  We take an approach of what either of us is fully jointly owned which worked when my SO was the bread winner and also when I became the bread winner.    With regard to credit cards though — I think you are right if you pay off cards every month then credit cards are likely the optimal route (liability protection 2%+ back sign-up bonuses that can be over $1k).  I’d say marriage does not need to be expensive — it’s more having children that is expensive (potential loss of income child care need for bigger house or in good school district private school / college etc.).  But also a great joy.
hm8vsd5,RedalMedia,11/27/2021,4,There are two approaches to managing your finances 1. Reduce your expenditure 2. Increase your income.  I believe you have almost maxed out on approach #1. Yes you might squeeze in a bit here and there in cheaper cellular plans or lower rent but the gains would be nominal at best.  You HAVE to increase your income. I have total respect for teachers but you are simply not earning enough. You actually cannot afford 2 jobs. If you must do one it must pay upwards of 70k for you to escape poverty. Here comes the tricky part. How? Maybe get a higher paying job at a private school maybe start a YouTube channel on the side maybe join one of those places that teach the corporate world (many make a good amount).   I wish I knew more about your education interests and skills to give better recommendations. But you know what YOU know yourself better than anyone. Find out what you love to do what youre good at and what pays a ton of cash and start down that path. It will take time but it will be worth the effort.  And another thing you need to get into the mindset of wanting to be wealthy. Kids are effing expensive everyone knows that. At minimum you need a financial plan for 18 years per child. You had kids when you couldnt afford to. Great emotional decision for you bad personal finance one. Bad emotional outcome for the children as well.   >Ive accepted that life is going to suck until I graduate and probably even after that  Why and for how long? If its for a couple of years after grad then fine. Else graduation isnt a cookie you eat on a cheat day . If your graduation cannot reasonably guarantee financial success (maybe not in the short run but at least in 5-10 years) then is that graduation even worth it? Money isnt everything in life but it is also not nothing. If your mastery of the subject barely pays survival income then is it really something worth mastering. I mean I could become a master in wheel inventing (if some Uni offered it) but it wouldnt pay anything. Why? Because it isnt worth mastering.
hmazgfz,blondie401,11/27/2021,1,I tend to use net to be more conservative however I think it’s important to keep in mind how much you’re “losing” from gross to net for non-tax items.   My husband and I contribute 10%+ to our (Roth) 401k accounts and will likely increase in 2022 if we lose the option to contribute to a Roth IRA. However if this pushes my mortgage to be a higher % of net (it will) I don’t worry about it hurting my liquidity because I could stop/lessen those contributions if needed.  Best of luck!
hmc0f4e,soju_shower,11/27/2021,1,Let me rant first about how much I hate car dealerships. I just helped someone buy a car yesterday and spent half the day at a dealership that has no haggle pricing so youd think everything is fast right? They kept adding fees that they had to go back and remove. Theyre trying to get you in the door. Its true there is a shortage and they do want to flip your car but I dont think youre going to get the offer you think youre going to get. Youll get the lower end of the estimate and God know how much market adjustment theyll put on that new civic. One of the Honda dealers I went to said they only had 5 new cars and all had markups over 1500. If you want to waste a good afternoon give it a shot but your current car and mileage is just broken in.
hmcn3kp,Visvism,11/27/2021,1,Some companies handle this automatically with their plan services. For example my company uses Fidelity and when we meet the max contribution limit you can elect: - to have the money continue to be withdrawn from your paycheck and placed in an after-tax 401k account that (for the time being) can be backdoored into a Roth 401k this method continues to receive company matches - stop contributions and withdrawals from your account which stops the company matches from being received
hmazvmx,SAugsburger,11/27/2021,1,I would say if the match vests immediately then absolutely but if not I think you have to consider the long term probability of working there.

hma07g4,bruce656,11/27/2021,1,They can be depending on circumstances.  If you recall the massive financial crisis we had in 2008 our banking industry isnt quite as regulated as it is in the EU from what I understand.  Some banks require a minimum deposit to open an account. Others will charge you a fee if you havent signed up for  direct deposit with your employer.  Many of them will require you to maintain a minimum account balance or they will charge you a fee. So theyll actually charge you money... for not having money.
hmbkra2,TragicMagic81,11/27/2021,1,Youre 23.  Either call an insurance broker or use one of many online sites to get an online quote.  Youll quickly see if youre being gouged or not.
hmcka87,jennystonermeyer,11/27/2021,1,Im not disagreeing.  They will absolutely for the period covered.  Its a play on words which sucks and might need reform.  Im not clicking on those weird sites.  I have not had a problem with many properties but this myth is something people need to ask about.  You certainly have a one off title company or are interpreting incorrectly.
hmc1d9h,hopingtothrive,11/27/2021,1,Buy a house with a wife not a girlfriend or fiancé.
hmau85a,MarquitoMarquez,11/27/2021,1,4 years to reach 90k.  Also my salary would be increasing as well. In 20 years I should be making 75k.
hmc583n,porcelainvacation,11/27/2021,1,My wife and I got married straight out of undergrad. Were still together 22 years later- our only mistake was our timing. She was emancipated from her parents and getting great financial aid. I got a lucrative job just out of undergrad bought a house and my company paid for my graduate tuition. She wanted to go to grad school too. Then reality hit- as a married couple we made too much money for her to get grants but we also didnt have any savings yet. She still went to grad school but the decision to get married probably cost us $40k in grants. We delayed having children by 10 years while we paid off that debt.
hmc19yb,ronald_mcdonald_4prz,11/27/2021,1,There is a lot that a realtor does for you regardless of being new construction or not.   It’s a very competitive market right now you need a top tier realtor to be fighting for you.  Unless you’re a savy realtor minded individual don’t use your MIL.
hmczlkw,IndexBot,11/27/2021,1,This submission has been temporarily locked for review due to a high volume of rule-breaking comments. Thank you in advance for your patience as we try to maintain a high-quality discussion. The original submission text is below.  ---  My sister believes you shouldn’t marry someone till you can support yourself completely financially because she doesn’t want to rely on them. I want to marry my bf when I get out of college I would be around 22F and he would be 21M. I’m wondering how marriage would change our finances. My sister thinks it would be expensive. We don’t plan on having an expensive wedding or expensive engagement ring. Over talking we decided we would combine all our finances when we marry. Do you think this is a smart move financially and what changes would occur when we combine our finances as a married couple. I heard you get tax benefits for being married so would it be less expensive.
hm94zjf,SnooCauliflowers3903,11/27/2021,1,Is fzrox good for windfall?
hmcni82,moopuppy1995,11/27/2021,1,Yeah. The human brain does not fully develop until 25-27 years old. I would really recommend you just wait a few years. Graduate move in together actually develop a life where finances exist with job careers etc. See what works for you guys once you are in the real world. It may sound harsh but I dont think a 21 and 22 year old are usually experienced enough to have regular finances (maybe you are different I dont know). I have been with my partner since we were 16 and we did not get married until 24/25 and I still think we were a little young. I love him and am glad we are together but there is NO rush. And to be honest with you getting my drivers license was a bigger change than getting married. We were already established with separate careers finances etc. and just worked on figuring out what worked for us. We still are by the way. Marriage does not make life cheaper for us though.
hmbkg5z,Bandgeek7,11/27/2021,1,They mean that insurance tends to be much more expensive until you turn 25. In general thats true.
hm9qn1i,FairyDustSailor,11/27/2021,1,If you don’t get paid promptly after that your state’s department of Labor is your next stop. They probably have a website and each state has a process for filing a “wage claim”. That’s the legal process for filing a complaint when you have not been paid. Each state has different rules but in most states there are penalties to employers when the state has to intervene.
hmbvvzm,innocentxv,11/27/2021,1,I think it depends on your lifestyle but you can always homestead in urban areas if you want to be closer to conveniences.

hmcvd0w,_BreakingGood_,11/27/2021,1,I worked at a different wholesaling outlet. Our process for selling couches/grills/big expensive stuff was basically You want this? Ok take this barcode print-out to the cashier (where it is scanned like a normal item) and we will haul it to the back of the store meet us there for pick up. That was the whole process.
hmcomy0,sli7246,11/27/2021,1,Appreciate the advice. Thank you
hmb2ijw,Nitemiche,11/27/2021,1,Depends on how long theyve owned it over a year?
hmd1f6k,thisisnotawar,11/27/2021,1,You can certainly call your doctor and ask if they will reduce the cost if you pay in full. If not tell them that you can’t afford to pay it - they will likely be willing to put you on an interest-free payment plan. I have known people paying as little as $10/month on huge medical bills they’ll be paying for a very long time but no interest will be charged and at least theoretically these bills should have impact on credit.
hmad7tu,sirzoop,11/27/2021,1,You wife will probably need to start working to afford the cost of living on the west coast. Try finding her a work from home fully remote job. You arent even considering the higher cost of food gasoline etc as well as higher amount of state income taxes you will need to pay.

hmcmkhq,SeparateOrange,11/27/2021,1,You’ll need to contact the consulate of your country to report what happened to your passport and your immigration docs. They’ll also be able to give you further advice. They may cancel your passport and re-issue another one.   Also I’m assuming the scammers have your address? Call the mail service explain what has happened and put a stop on anyone changing your address to forward your mail.
hmc6fqi,CosmoPhD,11/27/2021,1,semi-captive is when there is a penalty to one party either when they accept or refuse new terms.  This is different from extortion where there is only the option to accept new terms with new rates.
hm9tzuh,StillMaterial5215,11/27/2021,1,Do. Not. Look. At. Your. 401k.  (Ok maybe look once a quarter)  Set it and forget it. I have several accounts but my main account that I started in August 2008 is booming. However like you I checked it constantly especially after the stock market crash the next month. I was told to stay with it and that’s what I did. 2010-2020 was great for me.   Just wondering how old are you?
hma2vkr,TidePodSommelier,11/27/2021,1,Didnt know about that service. Good info thanks.
hm9e3cf,ConstantSuspicious70,11/27/2021,1,This happened to me before. They put a stop payment on the original check and sent a new one. They took the money back a few days later.

hmbc40l,red_river_wraith,11/27/2021,1,Getting married is the biggest financial decision you will make.  I would encourage you both to discuss your philosophies on money saving retirement debt credit etc.  A quick google search will provide a litany of questions to ask prior to getting married.  All the best!
hmd3gl7,guy_from_the_gif,11/27/2021,1,Yo this is it! Thanks! I see what they say I’m in debt for. It’s a medical bill that doesn’t seem like mine. I’ll call them and it get straighten out.
hma1wiy,FunArt7,11/27/2021,1,Gotta say weird reading your story since I was in the exact same boat about a year ago with the same numbers almost to the dollar. Freaky honestly. Now i can say I did build savings for emergency then paid down student loans granted while they were frozen at 0% interest. And then have been pouring extra cash thats now free into my 401k. But since student loans are about to unfreeze I would split current priorities between building savings and paying off loans.
hm9q9vv,Jabrichmond,11/27/2021,1,A credit score around 600 is not going to get you ideal interest rates. If you’re not already I would join a credit union and talk about your options of opening a line of credit. They tend to have lower interest rates than a bank or online lenders
hmd2q8x,jkh107,11/27/2021,1,The rule of thumb is that routine screenings (most of them on a certain list) are preventive but if they FIND something anything further becomes diagnostic and subject to deductible and cost sharing. And yeah it sucks to have to pay but its also doing the job of finding out what exactly is going on with your heart which is needed.  Good luck.
hmd413z,Captain_Gonzy,11/27/2021,1,True but sometimes they do respect it. My wife bought a couch at Conns before we were married and got the warranty. Fast forward a year later and after her and I were doing a bit of roughhousing on it we broke a wooden piece on the inside. Called them up and they repaired it no questions asked or costs.
hmcsth8,BuildingCastlesInAir,11/27/2021,1,Its exciting for me too. The hard part is sticking to it 😆
hmd6zju,JayceThompson101,11/27/2021,1,They have not mentioned anything on why the money is owed or what it is being paid for. She has signed nothing nor has she agreed verbally or via email to agree to pay this amount. Probably will contact the state department of labor to protect ourselves thanks!
hmazwmv,Earthquake14,11/27/2021,1,Definitely taking everything into consideration not blindly following the advice here. Appreciate the feedback
hmcfvr6,thenewyorkgod,11/27/2021,1,The ACA requires that routine prenatal exams are covered at 100% no deductible. You will have to pay for any sonograms and lab work. They may insist you keep the $500 on file as a credit towards what you will eventually owe them for the delivery but its always best to not have credits with a doctors office. Perhaps your deductible will already be met by the time you have the baby. Perhaps you will switch doctors midcourse. So many factors can be at play. The best thing is to insist on a full and prompt refund.
hmclmnu,Middle-Management-85,11/27/2021,1,Do you have a high deductible plan? That could be totally normal: preventative checkup is covered 100% but extra investigation based on something discovered there is normal medical care with its deductible and copay.
hmbgafj,kepler1,11/27/2021,1,Yes you could make a quarterly payment to reduce some or all of your under-withholding.   Youll need to read up on how quarterly payments if they come unevenly during the year will be used to calculate the amount of interest owed.   If I recall correctly you roughly pay a penalty in interest according to the number of tax quarters by which you underpaid.   I think this is form 1040-ES and related instructions.  But note there are 2 other factors that might make this less painful.   In any case when you underpay / under-withhold during the year the penalty for doing so is an interest % charge on the amount by which you under-withheld and for how long it was under-withheld.  So even if you owe thousands at tax time due to under-withholding you only pay a smaller % penalty for not having withheld properly (and you wouldve had to pay the tax amount anyway).   Second underpayment penalties will not apply if you paid during the year withholding and estimated tax of at least 90% of the tax for the current year or 100% of the tax shown on the return for the prior year.   (110% for certain higher income households)    -- directly from the IRS: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306  So if you happen to qualify by that criterion you may not owe any penalty at all.  Of course you still have to pay the tax amount due.

hma3ci1,jachildress25,11/27/2021,1,A 401k is a decades long investment. It’s going to go up and down but in the long term it will grow. Even if the market drops 50% on Monday you will still come out way ahead by the time you retire.
hmae4qt,Particular-Earth-453,11/27/2021,1,Spouse and I are trying really hard to keep our total food at $1250 a month between groceries restaurants and Costco. Over the summer we spent about $200 more a month than that - I blame the post covid environment lol. We were going out more than we should have.   The $1250 number includes meal planning meal prepping all my lunches and a couple lunches a week for spouse with a couple lunches out or a freezer meal on the WFH days for them. The going out includes probably 1 date night a month and a couple weekend lunches or take out dinners or we blow the budget. It sounds like so much money to me but everything is so expensive.
hmcv5xy,vinogato1,11/27/2021,1,This is incorrect. You cannot finance credit card debt into a purchase money mortgage.  If you already have a home with equity built you could do a cash out refinance to pay off debts but youre not saving money in the long run. Instead of paying 7% interest for several years you will be paying interest on that debt for 30 years.
hmaglqs,ArtLife8246,11/27/2021,1,Find out who the adjacent property owners are and see if they have an interest. You can find the property owners by looking at a platt book or call the county recorder’s office.
hmbuflu,Nova_Nightmare,11/27/2021,1,Its been a long while for me but doesnt the hiring website have a function where it tells you which company is requesting your resume? Or let you block your current employer from seeing it?
hmcgg6x,RedditVince,11/27/2021,1,You can never move on to a better position if you are not replaceable. Training your replacement is a great way to control your advancement. Take the boss up on schooling get them to pay for it and allow you enough hours to complete the training.  If you can get help and actually improve your performance as a team it is a win-win for everyone.  If your truly done the lesser pay is a non issue take the new job may be scary may or may not work out better in the long run but you cant win if you dont try your best either way.
hmd8en5,DigitalPelvis,11/27/2021,1,Yup those are definitely on our to-do list. Especially after learning that my 30-years-married parents _didn’t_ have those conversations and my dad was left to make hard decisions alone.
hm967j7,TuesdayGamby,11/27/2021,2,Earn more money. Get a better job work more at your current job get a second job. Focusing on your expenditures can help but bringing in more money will help more. I dont see utilities or insurance on your list you may be spending more than you listed.  Spending more money on a car does not equal a better car. Spend the time you are saving to find a great deal on a GOOD car. Tell everyone you are looking for a reliable used car and someone will know a grandma that cant drive anymore or someone that would rather help you out with a private sale of a good car rather than trading it in. Patience in buying a car will save you money. Use this time to learn to identify a junk car vs a good car. Getting a car from someone you know will likely be better and cheaper than a random car from a dealer.
hmat5f1,UMfan11244,11/27/2021,1,Landwatch.com is one I commonly use.
hmbozsx,_DeadSeaSquirrel,11/27/2021,1,They cant ask for the money back because there is no money to return.   They can lower your pay going forward but you need to agree to it (or choose to be let go). They cant retroactively modify your pay without your consent otherwise wed have shit employers pulling that on people all the time..
hmauyjc,benj_frito,11/27/2021,1,That makes sense I am only beginning to learn about all the accounts and which are beneficial in certain situations. Ive already opened a Roth IRA on Fidelity with her yesterday which she put $200 into. She does not have an employer sponsored plan so no 401k is there anything I should know before opening up a traditional IRA for her? Is it ok to have both a Roth IRA and a traditional? Thank you for the response!
hmcllke,Baoeater69xd,11/27/2021,1,Thank you it’s something I’m seriously considering.
hm9pjom,LuminousRaptor,11/27/2021,1,Respectfully I disagree that I didnt cover the personal side of personal finance in my reply to OP. The top post for several hours yesterday was pretty much lol your dad is stupid OP take the free money. which is categorically wrong if OP is paycheck to paycheck with only $1500 in a savings account.   The emergency fund is the key. If they have 3 to 4 months of expenses saved OP can fully contribute to their 401(k) while snowballing or avalanching his debt. The loans assuming their federal are in forbearance right now so if their loan servicer is anything like mine they wont have to make a payment for 3 more months which is time to take the company match and still build a 3 to 4k emergency fund.  Then OP can decide if they want to prioritize investments or loans. As evidenced by my post Im very much in favor of not putting extra against the loans if on average my investment return out perform what I save in interest. But you are right in that is their choice and OP should decide for themselves which to prioritize.
hmaoqpb,Peelboy,11/27/2021,1,Yes you can and actually they should send it back.  My wife just had surgery and paid $1500 too much and we just got the check back last week.  Talk to their billing to let them know you know and things should start to happen.  If they dont start to dig and if you live in the US talk to your insurance and let them know what is going on.  We had a doctor that was double billing our daughter and my wife called up the insurance and they stopped paying out to that medical office and they fixed the issue real quick when the money stopped.coming from every patient with that insurance.

hmcwfni,Specialist_Singer171,11/27/2021,1,Trust me I know from experience 😂
hmcmbjc,baddad49,11/27/2021,1,id guess a 401k or maybe a pension that was started on your behalf...even if you never contributed to it sometimes employers will create these accounts for their employees and contribute profit-sharing into it as i believe there is some tax benefits for the company...they would likely have informed you about this at the time but since it was quite a while ago and you were young at the time its certainly possible that you just werent really paying attention (no offense intended...most teenagers dont pay attention to stuff like this)

hmbgf59,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,11/27/2021,1,>The PA I saw told me the imaging center would be in network  Unless PA in this instance means *personal assistant* to the insurance seller what PA tells you about insurance seller networking is meaningless at best.  Exception: you were at the VA and didnt know it you were a traditional Medicare enrollee under some very specific conditions and didnt know it or you were told by PA whose employer and the facility and the insurance seller itself were all sporting the same vertically integrated operating brand: the insurance sellers.  Its 100% end-use health care customer responsibility to verify the networking status of health care services/goods vendors prior to contact 100% of the time. With the first last and only point of contact regarding the networking status of vendors: the insurance seller.

Yes. End-use health care customers are the default payer in payer pole position #1. If that were not the case end-use health care customers would never be required to consent to a financial responsibility agreement that states they are liable for any and all costs in order to receive necessary health care. And you did consent to that financial responsibility.  >what to do  1. ~~Fight the insurance seller to increase its reimbursement to the vendor.~~ Bell already rung round already over.  2. Fight the vendor to decrease its payment demand from you.  3. Hire at your sole expense 3rd party fighters that will do one the other or both on your behalf for a cut of the savings. Step #1: invoke itemized/super bill spell and save your fighters a first punch.  4. Do none of the above and wait for the vendor to offload its receivables to a 3rd party debt servicer/buyer and fight that entity.  Pick which fight you want to fight or job out to other fighters.  >also is there any statue of limitations on medical billing claims?  365 days from billable event give or take.

hmczsi3,Penguinis,11/27/2021,1,My rule is NEVER put any business expense on any of my personal stuff. The company wants it? They can buy it via whatever method is available to them. This includes travel/etc. I used to not be so firm on this until I was “volunteered” for a class I never wanted to take and I had to fork out a not so small amount of money which took 6 months to get back. This was a legit big name company.   Never again.
hmakpsf,93195,11/27/2021,1,This one’s going to get messy.    Merchant will say they delivered it with signature required (which I’m assuming Fetch provided) so “not it”.  Fed Ex will say they got a signature so “not it”.  Fetch will say they provided a service that you probably are automatically opted into in general from the apartment complex so “not it”.  And you are definitely “not it”.  So dispute it with your credit card company let them figure it out.  If you never got it they usually land on your side.
hmaxhh8,Interesting-Brief202,11/27/2021,1,You might be able to give/sell it to a neighbor or the states land conservation trust.

hmaiipk,iheartnjdevils,11/27/2021,1,As mentioned several times on this thread when you set up autopay with chase the money is immediately deducted and a cashiers check is send to the recipient. While I do agree it’s on the tenant to make sure their rent is paid I don’t agree late fees should be paid when a landlord waits a year to report they didn’t receive that months rent.
hmcqxai,Backpacker7385,11/27/2021,1,The best bet is to invest in an index fund and then **not** focus on how it’s doing. Just throw as much money at it as you can and don’t worry about whether it’s up 25% or down 25% just keep buying. Check it once a year (or less) and save yourself the stress of market swings.
hm9l5jz,peacefulhectarez,11/27/2021,1,>because papa Sam taxes bonuses at 45%  Why does this myth refuse to die?  Bonuses are taxed just like any other wage or salary income. Withholding is higher on bonuses for most workers but the actual tax rate paid is the same.

hmbmev7,Stoic_Chief,11/27/2021,1,Yeah it does. I was hoping to stay here for a couple of year. I expected rent to go up but not by this much. Luckily Ive found some places that look promising. Moving is just a headache though itd be nice if I could work something out with where Im staying now. Ill call on Monday.
hmcq5yn,briinde,11/27/2021,1,Make extra sure your mortgage doesn’t have a minimum number of months before they’ll waive PMI.
hmcbccr,68_Bullitt,11/27/2021,1,>I am trying to figure out if I should open a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA to roll the money into. Or open another account and leave the 401k alone?  If you can afford to pay the tax event it generates now then roll it over into a newly open self-managed Roth IRA. Otherwise a direct rollover into a self-managed Traditional IRA.  Theres so so many threads on this. Read the Prime Directive. In short if you feel your tax liability in retirement may be higher than it is now (or rather you may distribute more cash yearly on average than you make now) then a Roth IRA makes complete sense. Youre young and just starting your career its hard to argue against a Roth IRA IMO.
hmcbpen,gtu160,11/27/2021,1,Remember two things:  1:Your job will be posted before your obituary hits the paper.   2: Youre only obligation between you and the company ends at payday each week.
hmcg0np,VegasOldPerv,11/27/2021,1,I live debt free and have a FICO score over 750. The two are not mutually exclusive.   Every month you are in debt to your electricity provider. You are in debt to your other utilities. You owe this money unless you prepay all your bills so they all show a positive balance and technically owe you money.   It is the same concept with a properly utilized credit card. My cell provider gives me a months worth of service I pay them with a credit card which I then pay off when due. The same with my other monthly bills. The same with gas for my car. Im not in any more debt than I am with my regular bills Im just delaying the timing of the money coming out of my account.

hmbxmu6,nerfherder998,11/27/2021,1,> I am not sure the 50% match was factored into your rationale.  It was where I said:  >but I still think you need to max out that match.  Im saying contribute to the 401k at least 6% to get the full available amount from the match. Others were commenting already on the need to reduce expenses (agree) and on the need for an emergency fund. My point is that if there *is* a worst-case emergency the money in the 401k *can* be accessed with the 10% penalty. If the employer contribution has vested he still comes out ahead.  Example: contributes $1000 matched @50% so the amount in the account is $1500. If the match is vested that withdrawal after the 10% penalty is still $1350. While sitting in the 401k its at least going to have some kind of investment option. If an emergency never comes its all win.
hm8uwkj,HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,11/27/2021,1,Pay off the debts. Use Mycaa to get a 4K grant for school if you’re still doing that. Save 3-6 months worth of expenses and then look into investing and putting in whatever needed to get a match from your employer.
hmdbs4k,hopingtothrive,11/27/2021,1,I assume this was after you had established a level of employment where you trusted the fortune 500 company and worked for them for at least a day before they sent you off traveling.
hmagbcq,styrofoam_cups,11/27/2021,1,Would reconsider what you need for an emergency. Hopefully 60k is on the larger side. Invest some of that and keep on what you need in savings. With current situation regarding inflation - your losing money keeping it in a savings account
hmcyd4v,flowers4u,11/27/2021,1,It depends on your partner. Student loans? My husband spends way more than I do and I’m the frugal one and saver. It took a long time And compromise to meet in the middle and figure it out.

hmbyyfa,popular_with_my_mom,11/27/2021,1,For me budgeting doesn’t work. I’m good at a lot of things nickel and diming how much I spend on stuff isn’t one of them. So I do a savings rate instead.   I used to aim for a percentage of income but now I do a hard number. This year I want to save X amount. And it’s up to you what you want to count towards your savings. I personally only count what I contribute to my individual brokerage account or what I put towards my emergency fund when I was still building that up. It just makes sense to me. So I don’t count 401k contributions or HSA because then it’s like ‘do I count the employer match?’ That’s too much. I keep it simple. After I’ve hit my saving goal for the year. Life style creep is fair game. This system works for me. If you can buy a more expensive house and hit the savings rate that you want for yourself why not go for it?
hmc9fi7,galacticpeonie,11/27/2021,1,The issue is that there are no conventional options available only option is private lender for raw unserviced parcel of land (canada). Once we have a house built we can get a more conventional mortgage at a more reasonable interest rate. So that is why I am seeking advice on the best case scenario for this interest rate  I recognize its ridiculous.
hmbu7tv,hmspain,11/27/2021,1,Its not rocket science although there are plenty of people out there trying hard to convince you it is.

hmaufvy,LanLantheKandiMan,11/27/2021,1,If you already purchased the car you cant do anything.   If you are looking to purchase then get a price from them( have them print the paper showing final cost out the door)  take that to several other dealers with similar models and see if they are willing to compete on price.  If you get a lower offer take that quote back to original dealer and see if they want to compete.     Also you shouldnt be paying taxes on a car for 2 states.  Even if you buy from 1 and ship to another the taxes should only be for the state the car is titled in

hmd07mg,lightnglass,11/27/2021,1,I understand fully - I also grew up poor but my Dad got me a credit card young and the first thing he told me was to treat it like a debit card to never charge anything more than I could actually afford - he wanted to make sure I did not get into debt.  This advice stuck with me in the back of my head while I watched friends buy lavish things on credit cards and get into horrible debt that they could not dig out of (and still cant).  Dont do that and you will be fine.  People get into trouble because they have shiny new toy syndrome and start buying up all these nice things they cant yet afford because they only have to pay the minimum balance (and dont understand how they are racking up 26% interest fees on that balance).  I grew up poor so I knew how to survive with bare necessities as will you.  This will serve you in the long run and you are already thinking about how to treat a credit card responsibly which I can assure you the majority of people do not ever even think about.  Youre already ahead of the game you just dont know it yet.
hma6rbt,ftblplyr46,11/27/2021,1,Lol what? You’re still paying for it you have to pay it back. It’s like a car loan. Many people on here say not to pay cash for a loan under certain circumstances.   Yes FAFSA is there and should be there for people who need it but you shouldn’t be required to drain every account you have to pay for already outrageously priced education which is how they look at it.   I’m sure I’m the unpopular opinion but it’s just that my opinion. I don’t think and expect to have to drain every account I have or saved for my kid to give them a head start to pay a greedy institution an overpriced education simply because most careers want a stupid piece of paper that said you went there for 4 years.
hmcsm5o,iSOBigD,11/27/2021,1,The credit score and credit history are very important.  Its fine when youre working your way out of debt but once youre good good luck getting a good mortgage for a house or a good interest rate on a car without having any credit history

hmbvvzg,ckwirey,11/27/2021,1,I’m not a CPA. Do not consider me an authority. However if you have $20k that you want to see grow…but also have access to in case life goes crazy…you may want to consider utilizing M1 Finance. It allows you to build your own mutual fund buying fractional shares. This allows you to get into very stable companies. At the same time it allows you to buy/sell once a day.  If you’re not familiar with investing go get advice from a CPA or watch CPA’s on YouTube. Same if you’re not familiar with M1.

hm9f4ph,krystalina28,11/27/2021,1,You live in NYS you have the SUNY system at your disposal. Low income students can apply to federal and state grants that could cover the entirety of the tuition costs if granted the full amount. Any extra money left over is yours. If your income is too high to qualify for Pell or Tap you can also be eligible to the Excelsior Scholarship (income <$125000). You dont have to go into debt to go to college especially if you reside in New York.  You dont have to start at a 4-year college either. If you dont have the best grade out of high school start at a community college and transfer out after a year or two into. Do all that within SUNY/CUNY and youll have no problem with credit equivalencies. If you were to live at home while in school tuition and books would be the only college related cost you would have and provided you get the grants even if just a percentage that cost should be relatively low if not inexistent. There are also other grants fellowships and scholarships you can apply to while in school to help you fund career experiences and widen your professional network. You dont have to graduate without professional experience or job prospects.  Idk what got you thinking of Alabama but if you were to go through with that route youd be enrolling as an out of state students thus doubling your tuition. Adding in relocation room and board youd end up getting into debt. I strongly suggest against that idea unless theres more to this relocation plan were not privy to.  Just know there are financial resources available to low income students. Also college is one of the best places for career exploration and networking youll have at your disposal.

What do you envision yourself do if you do retire early? What do you envision yourself do with all the money you accumulate?  I mean dont answer me but just food for thought. Know your why because when you do make that mistake as you will its what life is all about then you wouldnt regret your decision... Or at least not as much lol.

hma0ysn,Stable-McCafe,11/27/2021,1,You doing good. Boost your liquid savings to about 6-9months especially as your expenses increase with a child coming in.   Make the CC balance go away as fast as your can.  For 529 ask yourself how much would you like to contribute for your kids education. With tuition rates increasing 5% per year.. 18-19 years later youll be looking at a very different tuition and fee landscape for college students. Do that calculation for total sum and work backwards.  P.S. good for you to have a non-negotiable travel budget. So many people save and save and save and forget to enjoy life. Proud of u.
hmcuqob,lightnglass,11/27/2021,1,Female here my Mother always taught me from a young age to be able to support myself so that if I had to leave a relationship I could.  I am in a long term relationship (not married dont care about going through the legalities of it all) and being together definitely is cheaper in the sense of we both contribute to our living expenses which works out to be cheaper for both of us than if we were paying separate mortgages/housing expenses etc.  However if shit hit the fan tomorrow I can walk away without paying a dime to my significant other since we arent married and dont own any assets together and I am able to support myself 100% as I never put myself in a position to completely rely on someone else financially.     I dont think marriage in and of itself is expensive it is probably less expensive than being on your own.  However I think what your sister is trying to instill in you is that you should put yourself in a position where you are never relying on your husband for your finances (like quitting a job and not working and depending on his income to survive).

hm9r9cg,ahhh-what-the-hell,11/27/2021,1,While this was a stupid move don’t panic 🤣.   *** Disclaimer- usually what I say people don’t like. But it’s the truth and it’s what most people think. ***  Check your school manual for rules and disciplinary action on plagiarism.  You usually have two options here:  1. Get ahead of it. Talk to the teacher or individual about the situation. Explain to them you were extremely busy with school work regular work and frustrated so you needed help.  Admit wrongdoing pout a bit and you have a 80% chance of just getting “the talk” and promising you won’t do it again.  2. Let them send your info let the chips fall where they may then deny deny deny. The school is not going to hire some lawyer to rummage through your bank transactions because of plagiarism.  * Remember schools need students. They care more about the government money you bring in to pay their fat salaries and sports teams.  I have never cheated on homework myself. But I have issued plenty of chargebacks!  * Bottom Line - If the product or service was not up to par chargeback.   Honestly I wish cars and homes had a chargeback policy. With the amount of surprises you find it would force buyers and sellers to make sure everything is fixed neat and tidy.   The guy didn’t do a good job with your homework anyway so you need your money back period. And don’t feel sorry. He should have done it correctly per your specifications in the first place.

hmd647a,1hotjava,11/27/2021,1,There’s two thugs you are talking about:  Backdoor Roth IRA. That’s for people who make too much to contribute to a Roth IRA. It’s limited to $6k/yr and there’s plenty of ways to screw it up and get hit with penalties. You aren’t at that income level yet you can just do regular Roth IRA  Mega Backdoor Roth: this one is different in that you CAN exceed the $6k BUT your 401k plan at work has to have two features that most plans don’t. You must be able to do the after-tax contributions sounds like you are good there. The other thing is that it must allow for in service distributions. You have yo be able to roll that after tax contrition out of the 401k and into a Roth IRA. Most plans don’t allow that. BTW this is another one where it’s easy to screw it up and get hit with penalties.
hmao2ij,Liu1845,11/27/2021,1,Go to 10% on your 401k. 5% of your raise to your Roth. Add 50% more on your student loans till they are paid off. Anything else left go to savings. When student loans are paid off start paying down the car payments the same way.  Make sure you guys go out to a nice celebration dinner just the two of you! Congrats on the raise!

hm8wfk8,charleswj,11/27/2021,6,I dont know if this has been mentioned and Im not sure even what your rights are/what their policy would be but Id request and push hard for access to an audit of what account and personal information this person accessed. This would be good to know in the case of future issues with credit or identity fraud. Depending on what information he has future account takeover fraud could be more likely.

hmcqb84,prophet583,11/27/2021,1,Reward yourself by buying something you have wanted to celebrate your raise and hard work. Leverage credit only to buy a house. Have 3 months salary saved for emergencies. Pay cash for everything else.  Exercise discipline once you have purchased a home.  In their excitement as new owners people want to change this or upgrade this so lifestyle creep sneaks in with tye heat intentions. Dont use credit for these. You either have cash for a project now or you will have to delay it until you can.

hmcw9fz,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,Your rent really shouldnt be over 20% your monthly income but that isnt feasible. $520 max if you plan to live alone with roommates on same leasing contract needs to be 2.5x combined monthly income. If you plan to move with a roommate that would greatly increase your odds. https://livehomeroom.com/ has 4 locations if you live in these areas everyone is vetted by the company to rent a room each with a separate leasing contract and affordable.

hmb4ml9,LaughingIshikawa,11/27/2021,1,I would say net income.  If youre only thinking about taxes versus the various costs associated with having many jobs (such as needing to maintain a car) then it actually doesnt matter all that much anyway.  But net makes more sense to me because unless youre making enough to make tax ~~dodging~~ strategy important your taxes are just baked in to the process of earning that amount of income.

hmb4vgv,Specific-Rich5196,11/27/2021,1,I think given your jobs relies on your vehicle heavily I would not downgrade. 10k for a paid off vehicle is great and is not what is holding you back financially. 3 to 5k for a beater in this market would give you some pretty poor options and if they break down you are screwed since you need the car to do your job.  You know how you got here. Its just gonna take living on beans and rice as Dave Ramsey says. I think you will come out fine if you can save and pay off the debt as aggressively as you can. Maybe sell some other stuff you have to help but not the car.
hm9sms8,SamMarlow,11/27/2021,2,Yes what they did is allowable. You count as a plan participant if your funds are in the plan for purposes of fees and possibly requiring an audit so its in their interest to get you out of the plan if they can. They can do so if you have less than $5k although if you have between $1k and $5k they have to roll it over to an IRA in your name.

hmca1xr,turnitout19,11/27/2021,1,You should ALWAYS have your linkedin resume website portfolio etc as up to date as possible. You are always available for the next great offer that comes your way.  You should be thinking about yourself as a brand that is giving its services in turn for compensation.   Does your boss or company own this brand? No they have a temporary contract with you and in exchange you provide the value of your services.   In fact the best way to get paid (in my experience) is just to hop jobs every 2-3 years if you dont see a future with the current company especially if they only pay inflationary 3% raises.  These type of jobs are a dead end - do not be afraid to bet on yourself!
hm931uj,Zookeeper1099,11/27/2021,2,HSA is very debatable. It depends on how bad the high deductible health plan is. For people who is perfectly healthy and without kids it makes most sense. But if you typically spend anywhere more than $1000-2000 a year or you have some chronic problem or you have little kids that might needs extra care etc. you may end up spending way more money on your medical bills than the tax saving from HSA.   Also having a high deductible health plan discourages people from seeing doctors which can lead to major delays on finding early stage of major problems.   Besides the plan difference it also depends on your actual income if your effective tax rate is relatively low (I used to pay only 11% plus FICA effectively when I made 92k) HSA doesn’t save much tax on this part.   That said The actual benefit of HSA is too dependent that Id put it after Roth IRA.
hmd59z7,WhileNotLurking,11/27/2021,1,They likely denied it because he did not take the standard course of action which is surgery.

hmcklx0,frumpal,11/27/2021,1,I tend to be very conservative on the emergency fund because I like to sleep well. Costs of maintenance / replacement also depend on where you live. I am in the northeast and 25k can go very fast. It can be a flood a foundation wall that starts bowing a tenant that trash the place and leave without paying or a couple of replacements  (e.g AC furnace) in the span of a couple of months.   Your job is probably safe (no layoff probably paid for a while if you have a medical issues) so thats less of a concern.

hmb1nli,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,Given that your income depends on a reliable car it might be difficult to pull that off. Used car prices are highly inflated right now a $3k car could be reliable but stands a high chance of having some issues that could turn into a big problem real fast.  If youre not reasonably comfortable inspecting a car or fixing it yourself you may find yourself in a pickle going that route.
hmb9d9q,Kakatus100,11/27/2021,1,I dont like to buy this argument. Life is a risk. How about the converse you dont invest and miss out on the extra returns on income so later on in life you cant actually afford that medical treatment and end up dying.  Life is full of unknowns all we can do is make the best decisions based on statistics and rational not fear.
hmcz6l2,kenji-benji,11/27/2021,1,This is very common.  A non profit can choose to sponsor a 401k but are not required to.  Depending on the plan design these were required to be separate plans. Merging the two is not optional one plan Would have to terminate and allow employees to cash out. Most employers who started with separate plans retain them as the termination doesnt guarantee theyll keep all the assets.

hmc66s9,Siphyre,11/27/2021,1,Would use use a family member for a lawyer? No. Anyone who does is an idiot. You want someone who is professionally obligated to help you by the laws rules and regulations for your local area and will not bypass those because of familial ties.  Mixing family and business will almost always lead to disaster. Honestly it sounds like she just wants the money.

Even just 1.5% for a $280k house is $4200/year or $350/month. Are you accounting for that?

hm9iup8,PersonalBrowser,11/27/2021,4,r/churning  Literally a whole community of people that do it.  In answering your second question about what’s stopping you convenience time and money.   The process of opening a bank account changing your direct deposit (most promotions require you to have a couple direct deposits) and keeping $X for X days is a whole ordeal. For most people it’s not worth it for $50 a pop even if it’s multiple times a year.   The bigger bonuses usually require much more extensive tasks or larger deposits (aka $500 for $25k in your account for 6 months). At this point its usually cash on hand thats the limiting factor.   Personally I do it a couple times a year. I think capital one had a promotion that was $400 for an account with two direct deposits of at least $5k which was easy and then Chime did a similar thing for like $100. But there’s been a ton where it’s just not worth the time or effort.
hmcfqrq,micha8st,11/27/2021,1,Never done a startup and never ISOs but Ive played with NQSOs and RSUs for over 20 years.  Grants and Lots.  * every time they give you new paperwork thats a grant. * each grant (for me) consists (now) of 3 lots.  The first lot vests 1 year after the grant the second lot 2 years after and the final the third year after.  I now get RSUs not NQSOs.  Ive been feeling like the worth of my vested RSUs is too high so I have a sell strategy.    * Sell so long as the total value of the shares held is greater than some arbitrary value Ive decided upon. * Each time I sell I use a limit order one lot at a time. * The next sale gets entered the night after the previous lot sells for some higher price.  Something like =ceil(P\*1.11).  a few years ago (right before the great recession I was sitting on a pile of mostly unvested NQSOs when my employer became the target of two private equity firm consortiums.  They bid each other up a little before one dropped out.  While there was still uncertainty I exercised and sold all the shares I could hoping that the final transaction would happen in the next year.  It happened in december of the same year so I got cash for all the unvested shares at that point.  The total cash-out was 4x my regular salary...and taxes were bloody.  Because we had less than a month and we decided to give 10% of the largesse away we spent about a month picking a bunch of different charities to give to.  In terms of keeping taxes down?  Just keep an eye on tax brackets.  RSUs they give you the shares outright when they vest and in my case I sell-to-cover -- that means I sell enough shares to cover the taxes that get withheld.  Lets say you have some options with a price of $12 and the stock is trading at 20.  Its typical to sell-to-cover at that point -- you can sell some of your shares immediately to pay for the buy at $12/share.  Then you hold the rest -- you own them.  Youll pay taxes (I think short term capital gains) on the shares you sell.  The rest if you hold for at least a year youll end up paying long term capital gains relative to the $8 you buy at.  At least thats how I think the taxes work.  (Its been a while since I dealt with NQSOs.)  The key is to meter out your sales so that you dont jump too far up the tax brackets.
hm8v2f9,LifeIsVanilla,11/27/2021,24,Weve all been pretty much drilled that the authorities cannot act until a crime has taken place and further them being caught red handed. This is of course bs but more importantly companies are usually ready to cut ties with employees and take the chance of being sued very serious after that if anything does happen theres already a clear evidence trail to who did it. However that involves a lot of stress to navigate and not reporting or participating is the path of least resistance(reasoned with the until a crime myth).

hmd80b4,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,Generally speaking emergency funds are most necessary for someone who doesnt have access to a whole lot of money on a moments notice.    Once you save up enough in retirement accounts and/or a brokerage youre almost always better off dropping the emergency fund and using those accounts for that purpose. The only emergency this turns out bad for is a huge market drop because while you may still have access to say $10k from an investment account the $10k you had in a HYSA (or i-bonds) didnt lose value and actually increase in value as a result.    So a $17k brokerage would drop in value (to $10k) whereas a $10k HYSA would rise in value and be worth $10k in the crashed market (which is more valuable than the pre-market crash).    Though for literally every other emergency the brokerage is typically a better option once you have enough in it.
hm9kdh9,Annabel398,11/27/2021,1,If you’re so close to the edge that order of operations matters get your money into a credit union. Not because of a line of credit or overdraft but because being member-oriented most CUs process deposits first then debits.  Some banks are known for ordering operations in the way that maximizes fees (even to the detriment of the customer). A decent credit union will help their members minimize overdraft fees.

hmar9le,Suitable-Biscotti,11/27/2021,1,Yeah exactly! You know they dont care enough to pay you market rate and now that they have to you know youll be on the chopping block the second they can find a cheaper replacement. Absolutely rattling imo.
hmd5m4a,thishasntbeeneasy,11/27/2021,1,The value of stocks is hopefully increasing but its unrealized until you sell. There is the chance that a stock looks $100 but if you a trying to sell during a crash you might get less than that so its not quite as good as cash from a bank in that sense.  Also note that selling for profits is taxed heavily so buying at $100 and selling at $200 doesnt mean you made $100 (more like $50).
hmd4s4d,cracksilog,11/27/2021,1,I also have a 403(b) and I work at a nonprofit. Have no idea what the difference is from a 401(k) lol
hmaipzj,Orangesunset98,11/27/2021,1,Completely agree most interest is 2-3% so you are double/triple the average I would wait for your score/credit history to get better or find another lender
hmcqdxt,PlusUltraK,11/27/2021,1,I’ll double down on this. I remember a paper form about half a year ago where a lady went minimalist. So less grocery’s nothing fancy. Beans/rice type of deal and the whole 5-10 outfits. But she mentioned how she started it just for the fun of it all and the idea of less stress and such. But overtime as she went about the lifestyle she doesn’t explicitly say but hints at it possibly enabling an ED. Where she wouldn’t want to spend money on common grocery’s  carton of eggs and stuff because that goes against the minimalist junk. So she slowly backed herself into a corner endangering her well-being /mindset with something she started originally with the idea of giving herself a fresh outlook.
hmc6ory,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Did the dealer want you to give the bank a higher or lower number than reality?
hmcyglj,Informal_Emu_8980,11/27/2021,1,Was it a deep-cleaning? Where they cpean out the pockets caused by periodontal disease? If so thats why its so much. Deep cleanings cost about $400-700 per quadrant
hmclni0,etblo,11/27/2021,1,I got the house and moved in early feburary and the nyseg guy that came for the leak (approx 1 week after owning the property) said take a picture of the gas meter so im not on the hook if its been estimated for a while. I didnt think much of it and didnt take any pictures. When the bill showed up in august or early september it said i owed 800$ and i looked at the last read date which was in (if memory serves) august of 2019 and my new bill from the prev mentioned date said actual (the first time since moving in) so its not my usage but since they didnt have a reading until months after I bought the place they think i used all that extra gas and electric in the 6ish month period of me owning the house all because i didnt take the meter reading i should have when i moved in
hmbmwc5,Stoic_Chief,11/27/2021,1,Yeah this was my first apartment. I remember skimming the lease agreement trying to do my due diligence but I was really unaware of how some of these things could bite me in the butt later on (now). I intended to stay here for 2-3 years - I knew the rent might increase but this is a lot more than Im comfortable with. But I will give them a call Monday  I found some places that are cheaper with a similar quality so maybe I can use that to put pressure on them.
hmb8rl1,Delta080,11/27/2021,1,The only advice I can offer is that you should make credit card payments and payments for your bills immediately as you get your paycheck deposited. Set up automatic transfers so that way the money doesn’t stay in your bank account long.
hmcl99a,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/27/2021,1,Find another bank.
hmb5x0c,wild_b_cat,11/27/2021,1,I would start with an emergency fund in cash and contributing to your Roth IRA. You don’t want your IRA invested aggressively if you might need to pull that money back out so be cautious about considering it part of your emergency fund but there’s an argument for at least getting the money in there so that you don’t lose the contribution space. If you wind up not needing the money you’ll already have it ready to invest for the long term.   I understand the appeal of crypto but you cannot expect those returns to repeat and indeed there’s a reasonable chance they do not grow at all. With your limited resources I would invest somewhere between ‘little’ and ‘nothing’ in crypto.  I bonds are not really a good solution for you right now.
hmc4u8y,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,Theres many of us that do support ex-US holdings (either by adding VTIAX or by combining both into VTWAX). Many do adjust their fund mentions based on brokerage if the OP had mentioned it.
hmbkest,kolitics,11/27/2021,1,You can hunt ducks anywhere.
hmdbriv,the_jud,11/27/2021,1,Its possible that hes playing a tactic but more reasonably they probably did actually mess up. The commission difference with $200 up charge is very small and not worth the risk of losing a sale. Companies are very messy and probably didnt have their crap in order especially on the most hectic day of the year in their industry.  In reality he probably felt awkward having to come back to you about the wrong price after you were already sold and had to do it because he wasnt authorized to sell for lower than that list price the company set. That probably explains why he awkwardly tried to justify the inconvenience off an incompetent colleague. He was feeling uncomfortable -- no one likes conflict.
hmcrxrz,curtludwig,11/27/2021,1,By increasing the percentage you just see less increase in you check. It also helps lower the increase in taxes. The point is to save a larger percentage but it also helps to prevent lifestyle creep since youre not seeing so much extra in each check.
hm9wpcq,aaaaij,11/27/2021,1,How much to save can be a complicated question as can how much to save through Roth accounts but you definitely dont want to save 100% Roth your entire career so maybe start there - why do you have / want both a Roth 401k and a Roth IRA? What pre-tax money do you already have saves or when do you plan on saving some pre-tax money?
hmaaw39,VoteyDisciple,11/27/2021,1,Take the best mortgage you can get. Who cares which partners are or arent on the mortgage!  The mortgage is a question of whos *paying* for the house. The deed is a question of who *owns* the house. My wife isnt on our mortgage so shes not technically responsible for paying the bill (a silly distinction without a difference since we have exclusively joint accounts) but she is still on the deed.  If you have separate finances and its going to matter who is actually paying the bill make sure you have a clear written understanding of that before signing with the bank. If your finances are combined then who gives a darn which name is on the banks paperwork.
hmbb7qm,Supersnoop25,11/27/2021,1,The bonds are garenteed money. You probably should max the 30k. If you wanted a garenteed %100 safe %2.44 return just pay off a good chunk of your debt. Other than that probably just max your roth and throw whats left into index funds obviously keeping a good chunk for an emergency.
hm8w7z1,PetraLoseIt,11/27/2021,1,> If he goes the traditional IRA route how is the income tax on distribution calculated? Is it based on his income from SS and his pension?  Yup all taxable income will be added up and he will then pay income tax on the total taxable income. (Income minus deductions of course).
hmd55pe,OptionStrangler,11/27/2021,1,When you invest in an individual stock you should do a thorough analysis and figure out a price target for the stock and a time frame for it to reach that target. This shouldn’t be just a number you get from your gut feeling but should be calculated using fundamental valuation methods.  As more data and information become available you should update your analysis to see if the outlook has changed and then you can make a decision if you want to buy more hold or sell.  If a company releases poor financial results and your price target comes down to the point where the investment is no longer worth it you should sell. If the price target remains the same or goes up and your conviction in the stock remains strong you should hold or consider buying more.  Sometimes a stock may dip from volatility but if you have a sound analysis then such dips shouldn’t make you worry or make you consider selling.   Another strategy people use is a stop loss. You should consider which amount of your investment are you comfortable losing. Once losses reach that amount you would sell and close the position.
hma5pwz,MHGLDNS,11/27/2021,1,If you aren’t disciplined enough to follow the Dave Ramsey plan then if you roll your CC debt into your house a year or two from now you’ll have new CC debt AND owe more on your house.  A question to ask yourself is if you really want to pay for your past take-out pizza Amazon purchases etc for the next 30 years?     Also the best gift you can give your fiancé is to get your financial house in order.  She needs to pay her own bills until you get married.
hm9pi0q,ozzie-oswald,11/27/2021,1,These market drops can be scary! It’s all part of investing. 401k is a long term investment so a day two or a few of down days won’t do any harm. I’m guessing you picked an auto managed account with medium risk based on you’re saying about yourself. This will be pretty safe. Keep on adding to your retirement and avoid looking at the balance too often.
hmbotlo,RoastyMcGiblets,11/27/2021,1,Did you at least try to counter the new job? If you say Id love to work for you but I cannot afford to take a pay cut they might magically find some money for you. Especially if you dont think its your dream job or going to be something long term. Id say no dont take it if they cant at least match your job. You dont KNOW that your boss wants to get rid of you you are not in a really bad position here that is one possibility but they may be sincere about wanting to keep you happy.   The path of least resistance with a difficult boss or when youre in a bad position like this is unfortunately being a yes man or woman. Express your thanks for their offers and act enthusiastic about it. You might consider deleting your resume from public sites but in your spare time be applying to everything and anything you can find. 3 years is plenty of experience to catch another companys attention.   That said when interviewing keep the negative stuff to yourself and say lack of growth opportunities as the reason to look for a new job.

hmczlzn,kenji-benji,11/27/2021,1,Financial literacy is incredibly painful thats the issue.
hmafzsk,Phillip_Jae_Fry,11/27/2021,1,Theyre okay just a normal regional bank. Their products are nothing special and their website is middling at best. Not as bad as some credit unions could be but not usually as easy to use as some of the major banks.  Neither Chase nor PNC offers much of a great product in terms of their checking account. If account minimums (to avoid monthly fees) is important to you Chase does require a $1500 minimum while PNC only requires $500. That said both banks allow you to avoid monthly fees if you have at least $500 a month in direct deposit.  Id say that if you have a branch thats more conveniently located vs Chase go for it. Otherwise its not really worth the hassle.
hma5wlq,Macluawn,11/27/2021,1,I also overlooked OPs employee only matches 50%. 401k matching also usually comes with gotchas e.g. have to work for the company at least N years. There’s an opportunity cost.   At worst his dad’s advice is irrelevant since the final numbers are close.
hma0bp5,boredprogrammerguy,11/27/2021,1,I don’t really see an issue here unless you are sacrificing in other areas of your life that would bring you happiness to save this extra money.  All extra money does is give you options. Options to switch careers options to go part time. Or even to fully retire if you so choose. Figure out what brings you joy spend aggressively on that and ruthlessly cut everything else. If investing and early retirement gives you joy go for it. If you feel like eating out every day is what makes you happiest cut back your savings and enjoy your life now. Nobody can really give an answer to your question.  You may not realize it but you are in an amazing spot and have loads of options moving forward because of your income. Saving 25% of your income means you can retire in 32 years on the same income you currently have. Bump that up to 30% and now it’s only 28 years. 50% 17 years. https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/
hmbmjru,WSB_Prince,11/27/2021,1,when they go back up  This is your first rodeo with crypto eh?  Look Im a huge believe in crypto -- that being said even with the recent pull back we are still up 200%+ the past year and still very close to the all time high.  Sell or HODL but stop trying to time the crypto market
hmcr6fr,justLouis,11/27/2021,1,Definitely try with another bank that offers a bank statement loan like  NASB Bank I suggested won awards from NerdWallet for best mortgage lender.
hmcn7wx,OfSpock,11/27/2021,1,Maybe. My BIL borrowed $100000 from his father and paid it back over nine years ago. Last year in his final year of life FIL called BIL and told him that he needed the money to fund his retirement and demanded proof when told the money had been repaid. My FIL was in his eighties but mental deterioration from drug use would explain early onset dementia.
hmaetc9,gubbabubbagump,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for this detailed explanation. I’m now considering cutting back on these deductions.
hmcx4n6,lkeels,11/27/2021,1,Well then it really doesnt matter what kind of care it is...deductible applies to everything. Until you meet that nothing is covered.
hmb4oqf,taku2472,11/27/2021,1,Yes I did do this and the rates increased by quite a bit. Last two months have seen 100% increase on electricity and water has seen 200%. The reason I asked the company for rate is because this obviously does not make sense to me.
hma4s3y,colinirl,11/27/2021,1,“Made you” seems a bit of a stretch. I’m sorry to hear this happened.
hmb4pfe,mattingly890,11/27/2021,1,Not all states have a DNR under that name. And outdoor recreation in my state is handled under a Parks and Recreation section besides the general public would rarely interact directly with the DNR itself.

hmb07w8,stubbornkelly,11/27/2021,1,My household income is just a bit higher than yours and the payment on that mortgage amount would make me nervous. You could probably make the payment but your budget would be super tight everywhere else which would make it hard if not impossible to save for maintenance repairs and eventual replacements (eg appliances roof siding).
hmcrrxd,Rainbow-Death,11/27/2021,1,Thing is that I should be covered for an x ray. It was just a cleaning. Cigna got a copy of the itemized bill I paid for and they said it was over charged. Now I got the reminder of the bill and it says i owe an extra 1300 on the 1400 I already paid for the same day. I guess they decided not to send it to insurance. Since I’m dealing with Cigna and they already said it over charged af and I can’t do anything about it. Should I pay this new bill to prevent a bad charge on my credit?
hm9vy6o,aaaaij,11/27/2021,1,$100k+ more? If that isnt a typo then how is there any question what to do?
hm9yol1,orcateeth,11/27/2021,1,I thought of this also but was hesitant to suggest it as it is radical and could be offensive to some people who highly value their marriage. However its only sensible to consider all options where money is concerned.   People sometimes do this to qualify for Medicaid for nursing home care.
hmaufnc,youngsimba320,11/27/2021,1,do you pay it off minutes after making the purchase or wait a few days for the balance to hit your account?
hmawnst,hopingtothrive,11/27/2021,1,I am surprised anyone would send money to an employer for any reason. They are supposed to pay the employee not the other way around.  What was the reason they wanted you to pay them?
hmc7sy2,InteriorAttack,11/27/2021,1,have you always had access to and seen this 11k? I would bet my bottom dollar that there was never any money saved ever

hm9xohb,Neatguyonline,11/27/2021,1,Why do you need a 20k car?  Are you paying cash or is this your budget for a 5/6 year loan?
hmaur2c,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,They probably dont have enough cash sitting in the branch safes. Some banks require 24 hours notice for cash requests of certain large sizes.  Its also possible he was just trying to help you. I would probably do the same. Young OP why do you want so much cash.... Wouldnt a cashier check be better? Having so much cash is risky to you and annoying for my branch.

hmanewr,123456478965413846,11/27/2021,1,Totaled has nothing to do if it is drivable or not.  Totaled means that the cost to repair the car to pre accident condition exceeds some % of the value of the car or that the car cannot be repaired to pre accident condition.
hm8yw9b,atxcats,11/27/2021,14,They can actually ask when people make large withdrawals. Reasons include terrorism drugs and scams among other things.   The last one - scams - would be to make sure the person making the withdrawal isnt the victim of a scam. Sometimes scammers will approach a person (often but not always elderly) and say they are government agents investigating a bank and they have an elaborate scheme which involves the victim being asked to withdraw a large amount of money - which the scammer manages to keep. Another scam involves getting the victim to buy a large money order to send in response to a text from a relative supposedly in a bind. Guess what - there is nothing wrong with the relative and the victim just gave money to a scammer.  So its entirely possible that they werent trying to insult you but just making sure you werent sending $1000 to a relative who was supposedly in trouble.
hmbyhqv,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,Credit can affect insurance rates.   Credit also provides options.  And let’s be real few people can buy a house in cash.

hmbogn6,Muted_Draft8561,11/27/2021,1,When I worked in-house as a lawyer anytime anyone accepted a counter offer their file got marked with a purple post it note and put in a different drawer. Half the time they were replaced within a year when we could train someone else up on what they were doing. The other half of the time they were excluded from promotions and raises unless it was completely unavoidable or had extra work dumped on them at every chance. This is why I tell people to never take the counter and why I am not longer a lawyer.
hmavf1y,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,You definitely need to know this:   1. you are doing okay! 2. keep remembering #1 (ie the above plus implying care for yourself)   Life is a marathon not a sprint. I cant tell you that you are absolutely doing too many things or just enough.     As an old fart I applaud keeping something as a side gig. Its a mind expander and helps develop the attitude that you are never stuck doing XYZ because thats all youve ever known and done.    Also it gives you a great perspective on what it takes to run a business how its multifaceted. The more you understand how the pieces (people money time management risk) work together the more valuable you are to any business.

hm92m87,BeatMastaD,11/27/2021,1,Your company is offering you money and you arent taking it. Yes sometimes you may want to save for something else first its always good to have an emergency fund but not contributing up to their match if you can is a waste.
hm92qgp,TheQuaeritur,11/27/2021,1,I would sell the car for many reasons.  1. Your debt is the worst kind of debt (credit card.) You are most likely being hammered with interest rates  so any amount you can throw at the principal will have a huge effect in the long run.   2. You have accumulated this debt over ten years of living above your means. The journey out of debt wont be easy. Any action that disrupts your old patterns (like becoming a one-car familly) will help change your spending habits.   3. It is a great time to sell a used car !  4. If shit happens (jib loss disease...) you will be in a safer place with less debt than with a second beater parked in your driveway.
hm9jh9d,TOPDAWG21,11/27/2021,1,Id hope anyone would work to pay off their student loan as fast as they can. I paid mine off a month after I finished college I paid a whole less than 50 bucks than they give me.
hmciafl,bbmmpp,11/27/2021,1,How about 0 income and high six figures?
hmavf4o,Duplicitous2,11/27/2021,1,Banks ask questions like this all the time as part of their AML controls program its very standard and ever federally regulated bank is required to collect data on potentially suspicious activity.  The amount of money physically in one branch has nothing to do with total cash reserves. Its not like in the movies where a bank branch has millions of dollars in a vault the assess their cash needs and order what they think they will need plus a small buffer. I worked for a top 5 bank at a suburban branch and we never had more than probably 300k in the building at any one time.  If you want to keep your money in a mattress go ahead but this is how banking works.
hmclpl1,ChaoticSquirrel,11/27/2021,1,Whats your deductible? Have you met it yet?
hma8yx9,keller892,11/27/2021,1,Another old person here. Factor in time as well. The nicer house will still be there in 2 3 5 years time. You can afford to buy it now but that doesnt mean you /have/ to.   It might be worth starting with the cheaper home to get some real lived experience of home ownership (trust me a house is wonderful but its also a money pit) and then upgrade later as your taste and finances permit.
hmcm2w3,etblo,11/27/2021,1,I dont think i have title insurance and i didnt get a home inspection cause it was a foreclosure when a flipper ran out of money but I did go through a lawyer and signed a bunch of paperwork but i dont know if they got a utility certificate. Do you think i should call the lawyer that i used?
hmcf0uc,Frednotbob,11/27/2021,1,Its not a *huge* big deal the boss saw the employees resume online and from what I can discern felt that the employee wasnt happy in his current role and offered to help figure out what wasnt working.

hmcxl63,Darth-Pikachu,11/27/2021,1,My divorce was under $500 but uncontested is the key to that. We downloaded and filled out all the paperwork ourselves and had already divided our things and accounts. Any lawyer involvement bumps that up pretty quickly.
hm8xz4f,growth_happiness_luv,11/27/2021,5,As a branch manager do you call account holders and offer new services?  I had a branch manager call today and ask questions that I thought were unprofessional. Started off as a sales pitch lines of credit for xyz minority you would qualify. Then turned into  What do you do with that money? It was so off-putting.
hmczrks,duelistjp,11/27/2021,1,if you are able to enjoy life without too much hardship at your current expense level id say not too worry.  now if you are living off cat food scrimping and saving to put 90% of your money into investment accounts you need to live a bit.  unless you have huge expenses planned their is no real need as long as you have a healthy emergency fund to not put money in tax advantaged accounts.  so basically unless you are buying a home or putting people through college you are probably fine staying the course
hmafxlx,tyclune121,11/27/2021,1,I have a taxable account online with them but don’t believe there’s a branch nearby I’ll look into that though thanks!
hmd1xnk,DoomBuggE,11/27/2021,1,That’s not how this works at all. Most plans cover routine preventative care (annual GP visit x 1 annual Gyn visit x 1 for women limited family planning limited basic lab work like cholesterol screening) without the deductible applying. Your deductible applies for just about everything else though outside of that extremely limited scope.  Young healthy folks may only need routine care for much of the time. However if you get sick injure yourself or have some other abnormal work up such as this EKG/echo situation that’s when you need to hit your deductible first.  I’m amazed reading through these comments how many people here have no idea how insurance works.
hm909hc,atxcats,11/27/2021,3,What the teller did was a fireable offense and he knew it. I worked in a field (not banking) where we had a duty to keep confidential information confidential and we were forbidden to access this information unless it was necessary for us to do our jobs. We had yearly training to remind us that we could be repremanded or fired for accessing this information for no legitimate reason.

hmbd5k5,GunSlinger420,11/27/2021,1,I have 2 questions here.  1) If your grandmother owned the land why would it cost $4000-5000 to change the ownership?  2) Is the land adjacent or near any current or future developments?  I am a builder and Wetland mitigation laws and techniques are changing all the time. A worthless property now may be worth something down the road if near a desirable area.   Example similar situation. My grandmother owned a piece of land in New Jersey. 2 acres of wetland. While she owned it it was worthless but near a tourist beach community. When she passed we did bot want it and reverted it back to the county assessor for auction. Years later they changed the Werland mitigation laws and the land is now able to be developed on 1 of the two acres. What was once worthless I now worth between $150k-250K. Had we just held it we would have spent about $1000 in property taxes and later sold it for a hefty gain.
hmcslnh,Fun_Personality1201,11/27/2021,1,You can borrow up to 80% of your homes value on conventional and 85% on fha on a cash out refi. Very simple
hma9lg7,Quirky-Ad-3400,11/27/2021,1,IMO There is nothing wrong with most target date funds. People don’t like them because they use bonds (typically a higher percentage the closer to the target date) but bonds can be useful as part of a diversified portfolio. The closer to retirement the less people can afford to wait for recovery and the less risk they should typically take. A target date fund attempts to do this automatically for you.  This site has many expert designed portfolios that you can consider if you want to be more hands on. Though the exact funds may or may not be available through your 401k they may have equivalent ones. [https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolios/](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolios/)  PS. The site works best on a laptop or desktop. All returns on the site are “real” returns meaning they have been adjusted using the CPI to account for inflation.  edit: Many people recommend going 100% the total market index. At your age I would not recommend that but here is what it has done historically.

hmax2v5,S1ren35,11/27/2021,1,Depends. Do you already have a savings account? First off would be to give yourself a few months expenses worth in savings. But youd definitely also want to drop as much as you can into that car note. Depending on your interest rate you can save a ton of money by paying it off early
hmd599m,hunt4245,11/27/2021,1,Thanks!  I have been looking and reading around in different threads but one specific detail Im not sure about (taxes in general always make me nervous) if I rollover to a Roth when/how do I pay the taxes?  Is it the kind of thing where I would just wait until filing my taxes in a couple months and settle it then (and it would balance with my refund and I would pay the difference if any) or would I need to pay it somehow immediately upon the transfer?
hma7fdk,Woody1918,11/27/2021,1,Wow!! I have it all in a target date fund. I am going to do some research in what’s available and switch it
hmbapdl,lig710,11/27/2021,1,Unfortunately like others have said it sounds like time is the main factor here.  Based on what you’ve said you are doing the right things but don’t have a ton on your credit history.  As for the large swing in your score could be inquiries on your credit causing that.  I recently had to apply to apartments and they did the standard inquiry on both my credit and my girlfriends.  I have multiple loan accounts related to my student loans 3 credit cards and a score around 740 with about 8 years of credit history at the time.  My score dropped a couple points from that inquiry.  My gf had a score around 800 but had never had any loans or credit cards thus her credit history didn’t have much there.  That inquiry temporarily dropped her score 40 points.
hmb1432,veloharris,11/27/2021,1,Dont think about what you have done and think about what you are doing. Stick to your necessary expenses and throw everything else at your debt. Youll have the debt dealt with quicker than you think.
hmd8f7e,DelightfullyRosy,11/27/2021,1,anecdotally my utilities stuck with the person. i bought my house and never opened a utility account in my name and when i finally realized i wasnt being billed for the one utility i called and the balance on the account was billed to the previous owner even the 6mo that i lived there and didnt open the account
hmbv34s,Kiole,11/27/2021,1,Start driving for Uber Uber eats Instacart anything to bring in money to make the payments.  Next go to Vroom carvana and Carmax and see what offers you get. If you can get more than your owe sell it.

hm9yalz,Signal_Icy,11/27/2021,1,Hmm I think that’s wise to do.
hmacb7j,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,Ive heard putting down 20% isnt as common in this economy anymore and that (with a conventional loan at least) its just a matter of accepting that you have to pay PMI toward the loan until you reach that 20%. We know a fair amount of people who have bought houses with less because in New Jersey at least 20% usually means 50 to 90k from what Ive been able to tell by researching houses in the areas around us. We are both first time buyers so I know I dont know everything. We are going to be putting the money from selling this house toward the mortgage. Our original plan had been to rent between selling and buying to be able to use the money from selling as a down payment but when we looked into renting after being asked to start house hunting the rent wed be paying for much less space was more than wed be paying for a mortgage because we have animals. We cant move out of New Jersey for family and job related reasons and we dont have 20% saved up but its also not as if buying a house will break us.  My main concern isnt so much the down payment. Weve come to terms with having to pay PMI. But my concern is/was whether or not I should be included in the mortgage. Id love to be debt free. Right now were both credit card debt free. But Im not paying off 90k worth of student loan debt anytime soon and we need to move.
hmbalr4,Snakebyte130,11/27/2021,1,See if it can be added to crp or something. Contact your local fishery and wildlife office and they can help you look into this.
hmamhav,jaybetterman,11/27/2021,1,Not technically but it does. If me and my partner spend 6-9 months together saving we both feel like we are a part of the decision. It’s the process of it all honestly.
hmcq5ew,money_mase19,11/27/2021,1,help me with 80k budget.  just started making decent money for the 1st time in my life. My rent is 600$ car is 400$ utilities 200$ student loans 350$ a month.   I feel like i eat out too much and bars too much but i love doing that. i save about 1k month. this is the first time in my life that i make this money and i have been buyings things like clothing eating out etc like crazy. lifestyle inflation is a bitch.
hmdalec,impressive_specimen,11/27/2021,1,Just used their savings [interest calculator](https://www.marcus.com/us/en/financial-calculators/high-yield-savings-calculator) and it says they give a 0.50% APY. Isnt that the same thing that is being offered by the second choice in [this](https://i.imgur.com/nQ0L9Fj.jpg) graphic?
hma3ldn,tdp5150,11/27/2021,1,Make sure you have a cash cushion before you buy a house. And good rule of thumb is too keep your mortgage balance to 2 to 3x your total income which you are well within. There is a real risk of being to cheap with your house and having to move in a few years (and in turn eating the commission).
hmb0h8o,umrdyldo,11/27/2021,1,Yeah I do TOD on my financial accounts to her. She doesnt know that   I help with her investing. She helps pay half the bills. We have a dog together.   We only rent though. If I were to buy a house I would probably get married.

hma2hc5,Default87,11/27/2021,1,Why not just use a similar target date fund as what you are using in your 401k?  The fact that new contributions won’t be going into the account doesn’t change anything.
hmatcu7,diatho,11/27/2021,1,Talk to an attorney in your home country about the options.   The simplest and probably not tax efficient method would be to open an investment account in your name but intended for each kid when they come of age cut them a check.
hmct85m,Mirabolis,11/27/2021,1,This is the way it is at my non-profit though I think it is a 403(b) and 401(a) not 401(k).  I believe those refer to provisions in the tax law.
hmb2kxe,Ok-Grapefruit-1072,11/27/2021,1,Being homeless sucks especially difficult if you want a shower and dont have access to one. Defiantly fix your car first because that is your home ticket to work and the only thing you have. If I might also give homeless advice sinks at laundromats are great places to bathe. In the cold weather find a 24 hour restaurant like Dennies and chill there for the night. I would hide a sleeping bag and sneak in the bathroom to sleep so you dont freeze to death in the car. In hot weather keep your deodorant and soaps in a plastic grocery bag and tie it to the handle outside your car while your not driving because the heat will melt them and stink up your car.
hmd4azh,Kraymur,11/27/2021,1,The idea of someone donating land for the sole purpose of duck hunting sounds imo stupid as fuck.

hmawl78,crabbingforapples,11/27/2021,1,This would be my order of operations. Figure out if the annual fee is worth the the benefits you might receive. If not next I’d call the card company and ask to downgrade to the fee free option of the card. If that doesn’t exist then I’d cancel.

hmcbhz1,68_Bullitt,11/27/2021,1,It depends on perspective. If you overpaid for the lease than the con is that youre paying more for the vehicle than you should. On the flipside used car prices are stellar right now.  Have you thought about selling your lease? Many have done that lately very successfully. Walking away with thousands in their pocket. The vast majority of leasers allow this.

hmcp7at,Superditzz,11/27/2021,1,Make sure you keep calling! Apparently I overpaid with my first child by 800$. I only found out when we went for the financial counseling on my second pregnancy 2 years later!!
hmba3vi,Brazenjalapeno,11/27/2021,1,Unfortunately you are on the hook for the loan. Car is irrelevant at this point. Source for a job immediately to try and make the payments. I would also call the financing company and see if they offer hardship grace periods. This can buy you some time but the payments get added to the end of your lease.   Selling the car is the next best option if you don’t find a job. Worst thing to do is stop paying. Do not let it get repossessed because then you are out of a car and you’ll end up over paying for everything in the future. Best of luck!
hmcm9ji,meezun,11/27/2021,1,I would say that if you can comfortably afford it buy the nicer house. It will get easier to afford over time. Buying a house is an investment its not like you are wasting money on frivolous things. Also selling a house and moving is really really expensive. If you can stave off wanting an upgrade it will save you later on.  But make sure you can comfortably afford it.
hm9d59q,maedocc,11/27/2021,1,>I also plan to deposit a significant percentage of any money I earn into s&p 500 index funds as well as a few individual stocks (hopefully through an account with tax benefits?

An IRA is your best bet for a tax-advantaged investment account not tied to employment.   https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/iras  The only downsides:  - you can only contribute max $6k/year to an IRA  - there are penalties for withdrawing money before age 59.5
hmapgjw,BobMcQ,11/27/2021,1,Well they dont get to keep it for free...
hmcg42s,Frednotbob,11/27/2021,1,To the OP: dont worry too much about your boss replacing you.  From what youve described hes noticed that youre not happy and hes reaching out to see if theres anything he can adjust on his end to reduce your burnout and adding an extra hand so youre no longer a one-man department trying to shoulder everything solo.  Id say that if you take that opportunity to figure things out youve at least stayed with a boss that *clearly* pays attention to the well-being of his employees and wants to see them succeed -- and that is an *extremely* rare and unusual thing to see in the modern workplace.  So....my advice: take your boss up on his offer at least for now.  If you decide afterward that its still not working out then be honest express your appreciation for his efforts and just let him know that you have to make a change.  Based on how you describe your boss hell understand that decision.

hmbnk0v,anthonyp17,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for the insight. Its taken on a much bigger percentage over the past 2 years 20% or so seems to still leave room for nice gains if it spikes over the long-term while protecting myself from downside and my emotional reasoning of not seeing the downside.
hmaj8uq,Ecstatic_Assumption5,11/27/2021,1,I have a BA in architecture and an MFA in photography. I mostly do Fine Art stuff but it’s almost impossible to make a living as an artist. I could do retouching digital archival stuff photo editing or design for books assisting and of course commissions. Not asking for anything but I really appreciate this. I just need to secure my identity and make sure this won’t interfere with my status that’s priority I guess.

hmb9hjm,kjblank80,11/27/2021,1,The donation doesnt even have to be to a state agency.  There are likely private groups that buy land to keep it undeveloped/preserved. Private groups will take on the donation.  The donation will still likely need to have real estate agents and/or lawyers involved to transition the title.

hmb3woi,cahphoenix,11/27/2021,1,They did not.  That is a common misconception.  Clearances are paid for by the government.   Here is one source but if you search you can find many more.  You cannot find sources that corroborate what you are saying.  I was also employed at a couple federal contractors before moving to startups.  &#x200B  https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs     >How much does it cost to get a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL)?        With very limited exceptions there is no direct charge to federal contractors for a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL). Government agencies receive appropriated funds to cover the cost of adjudicating security clearances and to pay an Investigation Service Provider like DCSA/NBIB for security clearance investigations. DCSA receives appropriated funds to pay for federal contractor clearance investigations and adjudications under the NISP. DCSA also receives appropriated funds to pay for security clearance adjudication for the military service departments and other DoD agencies.     Where ever you got that information it is almost certainly wrong as over 99% of all clearances are **not** paid for by the company (contractor). The company only incurs costs for maintaining the division/organization which keeps track of the clearances and clearance processes.

hma9b5m,AceyAceyAcey,11/27/2021,1,The mortgage is not the same as the deed (ownership record) — it’s possible to be on the deed but not the mortgage. However if you’re worried about divorce that would be a shitty option for your husband as then he’d lose half the house but keep all the debt for it.   You’d also have to check with a lawyer about division of property on divorce in NJ you may get half the house even without being on the deed.

hmcgztb,colterlovette,11/27/2021,1,Hold up. How is this your problem? The account (and any billing arrangement) should be in the prior owners name not your name. Your account would be a whole new account that now has the service property tied to it. New readings and all done on the date of the new account activation.   A service property can’t “own” a balance an individual does. Otherwise every time a renter moves outs there’d be chaos with accounting at the utility company.   Are you saying you activated service had a leak during/after that initial month(s) of service and are now being billed for it?   If it’s usage during the time that you activated the account it’s billable. Whatever the prior account had should be completely irrelevant as it’s not related to your account.

hmbtosj,ghostboytt,11/27/2021,1,Insurance is expensive welcome to adulthood.   I see that you already shopped around for your own plan but something that others havent mentioned is that insurers will raise your rates every time you renew regardless of your history and they often suck you in with low rates for your first term. So $250 is not unreasonable if youve found introductory rates at just under $200.   If you can get a lower rate go for it but keep in mind to switch insurer every time your policy ends or theyll keep raising your rates
hm9mn7l,chzsteak-in-paradise,11/27/2021,13, You have 60 days to put it in a new tax deferred account from the time you receive the check or you will owe the tax penalty.  You can roll it over into your new employer’s 401K if they allow you (usually it’s a form you have to fill out and send in with the check - ask your HR) or put it in an IRA which you can setup with any of the major financial institutions (Fidelity Vanguard T Rowe). Your local store for any of those should be able to talk you through it if you don’t know how. But remember the 60 days is a hard deadline!

My suggestio .. do one or the other rollover full amount adding back the rest from your own money...or just eat the 10% as lesson learned...but dont do it 1/2 way.  At least its a small amount so if you decide not to roll it over its less than 100 loss.

hmbnd6e,Remarkable_Animal_18,11/27/2021,1,Heres what will happen. If you have too much credit available to you you then can become a liability and it will hurt your credit score more than help. More available credit doesnt = more credit score. Keep what you have and continue to pay off. Credit scores take time for a reason you cant  fast track this process all you can do is continue to be a good borrower and pay watch ur credit score grow.
hm8yotk,acealex69,11/27/2021,1,I had an ITIN for casino gaming purposes but I read it can expire? I don’t recall providing it when I got the card. The way Amex processes a global transfer is basically they ask for proof of address in the new country and just open the account based on the fact that you’re a customer somewhere else. Of course my US credit limit was nothing like my home country one but it went up fairly quickly.  It just so happened the card arrived as I was remodelling my home and with a $1k credit limit I once had to pay it off 4 times in one day! That seemed to have helped though! Thanks for the advice on the debt/credit ratio have taken the increase. I’ll have call Amex and see how I’m registered with the credit bureau and hopefully that will be something I can take somewhere else to secure a loan or lease
hm9wof6,lolzveryfunny,11/27/2021,1,Well you don’t necessarily need a full match.  If they meet halfway it goes a long way to seeing how bad they want you.  Maybe it gives you information to help your decision.  Like if the manager or HR goes apeshit you get a red flag.

hmdghom,BlasphemousButler,11/28/2021,1,Renting it would be fine. Its usually one year that youll need to live there. Ive never heard of anybody actually getting called on this though.   You will keep the loan with the good rate after you move. You dont have to refinance it and you shouldnt. Some people move every period to a new home so they can open a rental with a low rate loan (rental mortgages have significantly higher rates because theyre riskier for the financial institution). This is called house hacking.

hmdkci9,buttfacenosehead,11/28/2021,5,very interested to see how this plays out. Never heard of such a thing!!
hmegplu,yeah87,11/28/2021,1,- Start documenting your income. You will need a paper trail to be approved for a mortgage. You will already have a harder time getting approved because its not W2 pay but 2 years of tax reciepts will help.   - Get you spouse a credit card yesterday. She needs to build her credit. If you have trouble qualifying on your income her steady but lower income can help.  - Sell your condo. If your main goal is buying a house 100k upfront will help a lot. This may not be the best long-term financial plan so you need to do an analysis.  Once you have a record of income you should be good in 2 years or so.

hmdu0ot,EfficientRevolution,11/28/2021,6,You get yourself $5-10k into debt by having $5-10k in credit available and using all of it. Some people make poor choices like going on a vacation and promising themselves theyll spend less over the next year and then they dont. Others lose a job experience a medical issue etc. and use credit cards to make up the difference. There are many reasons some you control others you dont have a lot of control over why a person can wind up in debt.      Most credit cards do not require deposits. Secured cards are a tool for people with limited or bad credit history to build positive history after they do that they can qualify for unsecured cards.
hmdnbzg,golfinghawkeye,11/28/2021,4,How do you plan on paying for the inevitable problems that will come with home ownership without using credit cards and paying the high interest rate?  With your current debt and monthly expenses you couldn’t buy a new refrigerator if the one in the house crapped out without using a credit card and carrying the debt.  If you have HVAC problems you would be in serious financial stress.  Pay off your high interest loans and wait it out for a couple of years and hopefully your income improves.
hmdkff0,softnmushy,11/28/2021,69,Ill add that if they are violating employment and wage laws those laws commonly will force the employer to pay your wifes attorney fees and a little bit of extra money.   So if you find the right lawyer your wife could make some money while teaching them a lesson.  Make sure you dont pay the attorney out of your pocket though. The right kind of attorney would not ask for that.

hmdpue4,mysidiah,11/28/2021,1,Hi seeking for Roth IRA investment advice! Im in my early 20s making $70k gross in CA and so far have $6k invested into FDKLX (2060 Freedom Index Fund) in my Fidelity Roth IRA. However going through this sub it seems that the 10% bond allocation in FDKLX is too much for my age range and I should instead go for a mix of FZROX/FZILX. So my question is would I be fine just splitting my next $6k into FZROX/FZILX and keep that FDKLX to offset the bond allocation or would it be more efficient to sell and reallocate the FDKLX? The general consensus seems to be that TDFs like FDKLX are an all-or-nothing thing so I dont know if Ive messed up.  Thanks!

Short term are taxed at your ordinary rate which would also be 0 in your case up until you pass over the standard deduction line. After that point you’d owe your ordinary rate.

hmdhf50,Mah_Nerva,11/28/2021,23,Where do you live generally? Based upon this information I can point you in the right direction
hmdnqfa,Pass_Little,11/28/2021,2,I think youre misreading the chart and misunderstanding how this works.  As of today youve gained $144.   If you would have looked at it a couple weeks ago you would have been up $400.   The stock market goes up and down but over the long term (like years not months) goes up.  But even if you just use the $144 you earned as of right now this is equivalent to a gain of 2.4%.   Over a year this would have been close to 5%.       Long-term you can expect the market to return (inflation adjusted) around 6%.   You can also think of it this way:  without adding any additional money as a rule of thumb your money will double every 10 years.   So you should have $12K in 10 years and $24K in 20 years and $48K in 30 years without adding another dime.  And because its in a Roth its all tax-free at retirement.  So no please dont close the Roth.   Youll thank yourself at retirement.   And keep contributing $6K per year to it as long as you are permitted to do so.  If you think about it this way: if you contribute $6K per year for the next 30 years and invest similarly to how youre invested today the Roth IRA should have around $617K inflation-adjusted dollars in it.   Of which you would have only contributed $180K to it.    So by contributing $6K per year ($180K total) you earn $437K in growth without having to do anything other than contribute.  And youve done pretty well with your fund choices.   I personally would have probably just chosen FZROX and FZILX in a 60/40 ratio.   Or perhaps the non-zero versions of FSKAX and FTIHX.   Note that FZROX has all of the stocks in FZIPX so FZIPX is probably redundant and could be traded for FZROX.
hmdgbje,dkubb,11/28/2021,5,The rule of thumb Ive heard is you need to plan for about 1% per year on average of your house value for maintenance.  So if your house is 500k plan to set aside 5k a year. Whatever you dont spend roll it over to the next year. When you need to pay for something big like a new roof the money will be available.
hmdhgd0,ferocioustigercat,11/28/2021,0,So while paying off debt is very good how long will it take to pay it off? The way housing prices are going if you wait you might not be able to afford a house in an area you want. I bought a house in 2015 and sold it less than 3 years later for over $100000 in profit. That house is currently worth twice what I paid for it. I couldnt afford my current house (that I bought in 2019) if it was on the market right now even with the profits from my old house. And I recently refinanced and wrapped some debt (psa dont pay medical bills with credit cards even if you have no other option) into the new loan and got such a low interest rate that Im actually paying less than I was even with the debt wrapped into the mortgage. Basically its good to get advice here but just research the housing market trends in your area so you dont miss out on reasonable prices and current low mortgage rates.

hmdgg4x,Throwaway123212349,11/28/2021,4,Did they pay to relocate you or pay for immigration work?  Those can also be subject to clawback in a separate section of the offer letter.  Most relocations are subject to clawback if you quit within a year.  We request gross repay if you are going to repay in the year subsequent to when you received relocation because you need to take a claim of right on your tax return for the withheld taxes that the company can no longer claim back directly.
hmdgvld,atitlan365,11/28/2021,1,I am not a finance whizz at all. So someone please help. How does getting a more expensive house compare with getting a roomate?  Do you want a roommate for company ? Cuz I don’t understand spending more money now for possible unreliable income from a renter. You plan to pick up extra shifts etc to be able to afford a home that you then will be sharing with a renter. Financial whizzes  is the rent they would get worth spending More for a bigger house if they are gonna be house poor and take on extra work?
hmdf6uv,SkepticAquarian876,11/28/2021,2,She rendered her skills/time and services thus got paid. If she wasnt doing her tasks on time they would have fired her.

hmdk52l,pharmerK,11/28/2021,1,He was probably denied because the documentation of his condition didn’t justify the coding that was submitted for the type/severity of his stay. Give their patient financial services team a call and ask them to have the coding team evaluate his documentation and claims coding. He should have been either “observation” or “outpatient care in a bed” not “inpatient.” The hospital can also appeal this on his behalf (and they may be doing so already).
hmdesqv,Bobthebullshitter,11/28/2021,3,Where are you located? There may be additional statutory reasons to sue them that may result in additional payments. For you and others.
hme3c3u,kerbaal,11/28/2021,7,> change your plan from HDHP to PPO then schedule it for next year.  If an out of pocket charge of $700 is a lot for you then take this advice.  High deductible plans can make a lot of sense if you can afford to pay out of pocket up front and still put money away to save. Then you can get one of the special tax deferred investment accounts that only people with high deductibles health insurance qualify for.  In fact I would say anybody who cant do that is absolutely being screwed by high deductible plans. Its a plan for people who are well off and making a lot of money. Its disgusting to even offer them to anyone else.
hmdiv02,Mah_Nerva,11/28/2021,185,Okay at a minimum she is likely covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act and it appears Texas does have some reasonable wage and hour laws. In short ask them to put in writing all reasons why they think they are entitled to return of all pay. After they reply take the issue to a labor and employment attorney and ask for a free consultation on this issue. It is highly highly likely that what your wife’s former employer is doing violates federal and state laws but you should get their “reasoning” for their request in writing first so you can verify before telling them to pound sand. Also if the attorney you consult with tells you they are as crazy as I suspect they are you don’t have to pay that attorney to write a letter on your behalf (unless they think you have a good case you want to sue them and the attorney agrees to work on a contingency fee basis) otherwise you’re wasting money on something you can write for yourself because it doesn’t have to be very detailed.
hmdrjfz,Alexstarfire,11/28/2021,1,Im confused how your story is different from his. In both cases they were mislabeled and in both cases you didnt pay extra. I assume you still had to say something to them.

hmdmgqn,pingwing,11/28/2021,1,It is sad we have to do this but ask about everything that they are going to do. Make sure you ask if that will be covered by your insurance.
hme9wza,pfinancelurker,11/28/2021,1,This. And even if the $11k was an unavoidable emergency it sounds like your emergency fund is inadequate. Homes are expensive and a roof hvac etc can easily run $10k+.
hmdi9zt,BluetoYou21,11/28/2021,13,You do not have to pay payroll back. I would push them for a reason for their request and go from there. If they will not give you a reason then speak to legal counsel to see what your options are.
hmdol12,1nd3x,11/28/2021,1,>You cant get a mortgage for more than your potential house is appraised  Yes you can. but there is the risk the lender says no but again...you arent *actually* purchasing a $450000 home for $500000. That was simply an example of how the money would change hands...and then i followed it up immediately with an explanation of how the money wouldnt actually physically change hands.  Your bank/mortgage lender is going to know what youre doing because you are telling them what youre doing. If you have any kind of credit built at all theyre going to allow you to run the risk of having a mortgage slightly more expensive than your home(especially considering they just get packaged into MBS/CMOs)
hmdisjw,bitenmein1,11/28/2021,1,Yes. They need to bill the insurance and refund you.

hmejd0h,mcarneybsa,11/28/2021,1,The annual visit/preventive care part of it is still covered at no cost. The office visit for a specific issue you are now engaging in is different. The doctors office is being very forward thinking in letting you know that specific issues could constitute a different type of encounter.
hmdesp9,preferablyno,11/28/2021,1,I have just a 457. At least as far as a retirement “account.” We also have a defined benefit pension plan.
hmdsxg1,islangmemes,11/28/2021,1,It’s hard to say without knowing ops job details and earnings. 4% for a jumbo wouldn’t be bad. But lenders are all about risk. Op doesn’t have much net liquid net worth (not counting RSU’s or retirement funds) and still carries minor debt (student loan car loan - I would get rid of these before jumping into a new mortgage no reason not to at these earning levels). I’m sure he could probably find a lender but it probably wouldn’t be at a rate worth bragging about. It also depends on things such as the area you’re buying total cost of the loan (including real estate taxes PMI hoa etc).   I have a job that gives RSU’s as compensation and to be honest I don’t even count it as income. If I’m there long enough to reap the benefits great if not then oh well I never counted it as income to begin with. Zillow is a prime example of why you should never count RSU’s as guaranteed income. Anyone who was working for them and was part of a recent layoff just got fucked out of a lot of that compensation. If they were factoring that into overall income in loans and such they would be stretching themselves real thin. I look at RSU’s more so of an annual bonus.   If op had solid job history it probably wouldn’t be an issue. But I get the feeling this isn’t the case due to the low net worth.
hmdcpps,Crazy_Opposite_7783,11/28/2021,1,Some issuers allow you to set a spending limit
hmdkj6g,jone7007,11/28/2021,4,Only if the $50 was invested.  Its mostly likely in cash unless you choose an investment.
hmdn7oo,PR2NP,11/28/2021,4,Find a job with better benefits. When your current job asks why you’re leaving tell them what you said here. Either they’ll do something about it or they won’t. Either way you win.
hmdu2rk,Buggy3D,11/28/2021,5,If you build enough of a credit score you can get credit cards that can pull out way more than that.   I was able to get a $16500 credit limit card when I was 27.  Having a bigger spending limit allows you to borrow more in case of a rainy day but it also allows you rake in more points so long as you can make your payments back.  You can also buy bigger and more expensive things right away without the need to get “approved” first.   In a sense it’s basically a bigger amount of pre-approved debt.

hmdhxju,craigiest,11/28/2021,17,It’s super annoying. My last doctor’s receptionist asked whether I was going to bring up any issues or questions because an annual physical had no copay but if I brought up any concerns it couldn’t be coded as an annual and I would have to pay a copay for the visit. What is the point of an annual physical if you aren’t allowed to mention any minor symptoms that have come up in the last year?! How is it preventative to discourage patients from providing the doctor information that might help them diagnose an illness early?!

hmdipoz,Rebel-Jedi,11/28/2021,4,NO!!! Roth IRA will provide you with tax free income in your retirement years. You want to invest long term and max out your contributions every year. Think things like ETFs are good and they hedge with diversity. A 401k additionally is great but unlike with Roth accounts that will be taxable income.  Index funds and REITs might be good for you too. Get a library card and borrow ebooks on investing for retirement etc it’s free in most states :)  It’s long term plays the market fluctuates invest and keep investing don’t worry about it for a few years :)
hmdz0dz,dirty_cuban,11/28/2021,8,Mistakes happen all day long in any industry. I don’t think the problem is that a mistake was made. But if it was a mistake why is the salesman trying to get the customer to pay for the store’s mistake? Why not handle the mistake on the back end without involving the customer? That would be the honest way to handle a pricing mistake.
hmdvnt4,DeluxeXL,11/28/2021,2,A rate means blah blah **per time**. Interest rate is almost always written where the time unit is year.  Do a dimensional analysis:                 0.0712    1 year      $10000 *  ------- * --------- = $59.33 per month                 year     12 months

hmdidqn,GenroMusic,11/28/2021,0,Not bad at all. I believe they count student loans as income but i may be wrong so that would adjust your cost but not by much since your asset to debt ratio is weighed as it is.   I am curious what you could afford with these stats too. Im in the area and at about a third of what you have.

hme2661,g26okie,11/28/2021,1,I had a performance model 3 right before covid started.  At first its the new thing but then you get used to it. Once the unique wore off I got used to the 3s 0-60 that $1200+ payment every month (36 month loan) didnt sit well with me.  If you figure a regular car costs around $30k that extra $20k spent on the Tesla is $200k in 30 years at 8% interest.

hmed0j6,j-christopher,11/28/2021,1,>how do I go about finding a lender? Do I just apply to as many places as I can and compare who gives me the best terms?  Basically although you dont have to apply to get a quote.  The most important thing to understand in order compare mortgage offers is how to determine the total cost (upfront fees plus all of the interest youll pay over X years where X is the the amount of time you intend to keep the mortgage (before selling the home refinancing again or otherwise paying it off).  Dont get lured in by no closing costs! or nothing out of pocket! until youve calculated the impact of the higher rate interest rate you must accept in exchange for this benefit.  It costs *the lender* somewhere around $8000-9000 to originate a mortgage.  They arent going to do yours for free.

hmdfi0d,xdivinex22,11/28/2021,1,I was you at 22. Eager to move out. Theres plenty of jokes & jabs out there about guys (especially guys in my opinion) living at home with their parents 21+. Felt a societal pressure to prove myself that I can be out & on my own  I nonetheless decided to wait & pile up cash and not move out till I was 25. Now Im a much richer man because of it & dont feel my growth was stunted at all. Seriously how much you can get ahead by staying at home is incredible. People wouldnt believe my net worth at 26 with only a modest income.  Im 26 now & have been out & on my own the past 6 months. Do I feel any different than when I was living at home? No not really. When I was living at home I was still working my job paying my car loan played video games & watched Netflix worked out hung out with friends on the weekend ect.  Now Im out on my own & Im *still* working my job paying my car loan playing video games & watching Netflix working out hanging out with friends on the weekend ect. Not much has changed. I do have more bills thats the biggest downfall no doubt. I do have more privacy it is more lonely and it is such easier dating for sure (not sure what your situation is there).  Long story short is no youre not slowing down your personal growth. Im on the other side of it now & I think its actually asinine that we collectively have this view that staying at home with your family is slowing personal growth.
hmdhbx0,dequeued,11/28/2021,2,If shes a self-employed an individual 401(k) is a great option. A SEP-IRA is also an option but a 401(k) usually comes out being the somewhat better choice for most people. If the LLC has other employees then shell want to look at a small business 401(k) or a SIMPLE IRA as options for the business (SEP-IRAs are also an option for small businesses).  For individual 401(k) plans Fidelity Schwab or Vanguard are all good options but there are advantages and disadvantages to each.

hmdlxuo,TheNovac,11/28/2021,2,12k in medical bills is extremely low for a case where youre expecting to max out a high-limit policy. While you can consider future medical bills you likely need to be seeing every specialist you possibly can to address your injuries. Its strange having a lawyer ask YOU for a number since there is so much variation. Make sure you check the statute of limitations on personal injury claims in your state dont wait until right before (or after) the deadline to file or youre out of luck (Im assuming since you have an attorney youve already filed a lawsuit). Also remember that whoever youre suing has a max on their policy so something like $5 million is unlikely Id say probably $1 million tops. Also note that there are things like Social Security disability benefits that can help you.  In terms of an exact amount you should expect I wouldnt put a dollar amount on it until you receive a final settlement offer from the insurance company. At that point you would discuss your odds of achieving greater than that at trial keeping in mind that you could receive much more or much LESS given the risks of a trial.
hmdo3gx,raisuki,11/28/2021,1,You’re a college student - do what makes you feel good. Although being smart about your money is great early I honestly consider college a lost cause unless you’re an entrepreneur with a company already under your belt.   From what I’m seeing it’ll be money well spent. I always say money is generally worth it even though I’m frugal if it’s for your health - $30 is pretty standard for a normal gym with basic stuff.

hme6g1v,wyezwunn,11/28/2021,1,Heres what Ive tried.   1. Got charged for a procedure that was advertised as free. Their guy call me and said he was a lawyer and I should pay because the other part of that days procedure was the free part. I said I disagree so Im not paying and tell the doctor hes already spent more paying you to call me than hell ever get from me so he should cut his losses and leave me alone. Lawyer laughed and hung up. They left me alone. 2. Got charged for another preventive procedure and they said I said something about a problem after I came in so the procedure was diagnostic and not free. Gave them the same *cut your losses* spiel along with telling them I had excellent credit that would still be excellent if they put it on my credit report so dont expect me to pay for that bait-and-switch. They put it on my credit report. My credit stayed excellent especially after I put a note in my credit report with my explanation. My employer routinely checks employees credit and didnt see it as a problem.  3. Got charged for an annual check-up because they said they found something. I told them their diagnostic procedure was wrong according to a credible health entitys guidelines so they couldnt prove they found something. They paid me back what theyd overcharged. Took ten years and an audit but they paid me back.  About $100 each time. I could afford it but it was the principle. Not sure if any of this would work for OPs $700.
hmdjlo1,CQME,11/28/2021,2,> So I am thinking of just taking the hit and lesson learned to not invest and closing my Roth early and putting it back into my savings account. Still I figured it might be a good idea to have others take a look and see just how bad my ROTH is and see if it is either somewhat repairable or just a quit while it is not to bad scenario.  Index funds will fluctuate.  Just because over the long term stocks do well doesnt mean they do well in the short and medium term.  Buy and hold is exactly that...you buy and then you hold.  You dont sell when the the market takes a dip just like you dont tear down your house in the middle of a storm.

hmdkw9z,Derrick2020,11/28/2021,93,My favorite was a few years back my wife and I were buying a new car. It came with a fairly extensive warranty but they had a guy trying to upsell a better warranty. I’ve never been one to go for something like that but I let them talk to me. (My wife was surprised I let them talk to me as long as I did). I finally let them know I wasn’t interested and they went with the hard sell letting me know about all the stuff that could go wrong and that it would be covered.   I finally looked at him and told him that I don’t know if I want to buy a vehicle that the dealership has so little confidence in and got up to start to walk out.   I’ve never seen such a quick about face.

hmdrv1b,Pass_Little,11/28/2021,2,Youll need to get a credit report which includes soft inquiries.  On your credit report you have two types of inquiries one is the hard inquiries which is what you see when you apply for a credit card or bank loan.  The soft inquiries are what these companies use.   They dont affect your credit score and dont appear as a hard inquiry on your report.   However the credit bureaus do keep track of them.  It used to be when you ordered a credit report they were listed.  However I havent seen any on any of the reports Ive seen recently.  A google search also didnt turn up any hard hits on how to get a report with this data.  You may want to reach out to one or more of the credit bureaus to see if you can get your own report with that data attached.  As far as lenders go the ones you mentioned seem rather benign.   That is they almost all fall into the buy something and split the payment into 4 payments with no interest type of lenders which I could see me using if I needed something that I couldnt afford right this second but did have the budget for over the next couple of months.     They arent really open-ended credit products but instead sort of halfway between paying cash and having a revolving store card.

We consolidated  that debt so it is at 0% but I can promise you I just want it gone. Gone. Dead. Gone. Then the HVAC loan is 6.8% with about 3.5k left which  I thought was really bad when they offered that but then I tried to get a personal loan through my credit union and it really wasnt any better. And when youre AC dies in July in the mid-Atlantic with a newborn got to roll with it.

hmdps3s,EfficientRevolution,11/28/2021,7,A credit score is not an asset - its the lack of a barrier. A good credit score gives you full access to the best rates/terms for things like credit insurance employment etc. A bad credit score puts up a wall when trying to access those things and you have to do something to get over it like paying a higher rate borrowing a smaller amount relative to your income. If its bad enough you might not be able to get over the wall some jobs are impossible to qualify for if you have very bad credit and a lot of outstanding past due debt.      Theres no good reason to build a barrier for yourself - even if you think you might never need to head that direction why make it harder on the off chance you do? Maintain your score as you have been keep your interest paid as low as possible and know that it wont get in your way.
hmdgqpi,Alskdkfjdbejsb,11/28/2021,15,You owe $7k in credit card debt with a $220 minimum payment and you’re only making $200 payment towards it per month? You aren’t anywhere close to being in a position to buy a house. You can’t afford your existing debt how can you expect to take on a mortgage?

hmdi1ih,Specific-Rich5196,11/28/2021,2,I would invest it in anything that makes more than your mortgage interest rate. Otherwise you would be better off paying down the mortgage. Of course make sure you have am emergency fund etc.
hmefh17,ThatGuyLarose,11/28/2021,1,If you don’t pay off the high interest debt now then by the time you do eventually by a house and move in your gonna rack up a lot more just moving and settling into the new home anyways. also if your struggling to pay down the credit cards are you really in a place where you can afford a house? It only takes one bad plumbing visit to send you down the hole on a new house at least make sure you’re getting a potential place inspected first
hme3ay5,2xOPisANidiot,11/28/2021,8,If you are living paycheck to paycheck while renting you should definitely NOT buy a house. Full stop. This person has CC debt he cannot pay off. He absolutely should not buy a house.

We told the salesman we wanted the black version and in looking over the paperwork the price was $140 higher.  Oh the sticker price is for the stainless model. The black version is higher.  We walked away. The sales guy came after us literally running right as we were exiting the store saying we could have the black model for the original price.

hmecgy2,stopcounting,11/28/2021,3,Im not saying it never works out Im just saying its a huge risk. There are dozens of freak things that can go wrong with a house even if its totally fine when you buy it and youre handy enough for small fixes.  According to your post history it looks like you bought your house a couple years ago and youre already looking at possible foundation issues that would cost over 60k to repair.  Edited to fix timeline and cost of repairs after double-checking.
hmddmwz,NoSatisfaction4251,11/28/2021,1,Just get the degree and apply to different jobs online. You don’t need to do what you studied. A college degree is more about signalling to employers you can work consistently with deadlines.   One of the most financially successful people I know became a Wall Street Investment banker in the 1980s with a degree in Zoology from a state college in the South. If you’re that close and have the debt anyway just finish it.  Having a BA or BS will basically open any doors you want. And then just try careers that seem mildly interesting until you find one you really like. With Kinesiology every career path except basically engineering is open to you.   Even if it’s not what you want to hear or sounds lame it’s the smart thing to do if you have already paid for 90% of it.   PS: few people at your age know what they actually want to do so don’t worry about that.
hmdcdcy,kazoni,11/28/2021,1,I worked with a plan that was set up like that. The executive director maxed out in the 401 and 403 then the company put the rest into a 457f.  It was insane but all above board.

hmdlzp9,Pass_Little,11/28/2021,2,Is this a small business or a giant one?   It will be easier to encourage a small one to change)  Also how few vacation days and does this increment with longevity?   If this is a you get a week off and youll never get one more day no matter how long you work here thing then you might find that this is a place that doesnt value their employees.  I know that in relation to vacation I tend to ratchet up the number of weeks of vacation as the employees reach longevity and/or raise milestones.   2 weeks at hire with additional weeks added as time goes on as part of employee reviews.  But for the rest of the benefits this might just be an issue of having never taken the time to review the cost of their benefits to determine if they can provide something better for a similar amount of cost.   Or they might think something costs a lot more than it does.  For example some mediocre health insurance costs a horrendous amount of money.   By contrast A good HDHP often has lower premiums and often has a lower max out of pocket than a normal health plan.   The reason is that the HDHP doesnt cover most little things like broken arms or multiple doctors visits (other than a wellness visit or two per year).   By focusing on providing 100% coverage once you reach a deductible (often around $3-5K) they are able to reduce the premium costs.   From the employees perspective they know that they are never going to need more than the deductible for health costs in a year.  With a HDHP you can then open a HSA which allows you to pay for almost anything medical pre-tax and the money is yours forever if you dont spend it this year.      Using this as an example often employers just get health insurance from whatever salesperson walks through the door first so they can list that as a benefit on their job listings.   There is every chance that this is what happened so they have this crap plan just because thats what some salesperson sold to them.   If you can show them that they could switch and it would either save them money or only cost them a little more to get a much better plan for their employees most would do this.  401ks are similar.   Some 401k plans cost employers hundreds of dollars per year per employee just to have the plan.   Others cost much less.    Also some 401k plans are horrible from the employees viewpoint because they have crap options.  And if they didnt do their research they probably have both a crap plan for the employees and are paying way too much for it.  Oh and the life insurance:  If this is valuable to you you should just go buy a term plan on your own.  When I went looking for this as a employee benefit I found the plans available to employers were generally poor quality (lots of exclusions) and way too expensive.
hmdex6l,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,1,Great idea! I’ll interview lawyers and ask the right questions to learn from them. I am just afraid a lawyer will tell me this is more drastic than it actually is just for them to get business from my wallet

hmen09a,SnowShoe86,11/28/2021,1,Had \*same\* exact BS stunt pulled on me last year at some special sale w free delivery and 0% finance etc. after I agreed to purchase a $1600 sofa the salesman came back and said they had forgot to update the price tag for the sale and it was actually $1800 but at 0% it was a better deal than $1600 and whatever their normal rate was.  I said that jerk around math doesnt work on me I walked in your store and agreed to buy what you advertised at the deal you advertised. If you dont want to sell it cancel the whole deal.   &#x200B  Its not so much the commission on the one deal I think a lot of furniture stores operate on a total sales goal for the rep to earn monthly or quarterly bonuses. If they have slide a few hundred more into a deal they are that much closer to their big payout goal.    I feel like this is a common tactic in furniture and mattress sales.
hmdw7ar,never_reddit_sober,11/28/2021,1,My coworker changed shifts from 8hr days to 12hr days and HR never updated his work rule so for months he was being paid OT on hours 9-12 every shift... Obviously a mistake and when it did get fixed they did not try to collect from him. I cant imagine youll be asked to pay anything back and its likely youll never get a pay cut as others have said.
hmdohv6,Old_Ladies_Die_Hard,11/28/2021,1,I tried to move an existing IRA to Fidelity several weeks ago. I got the same “technical difficulties” message and used their chat function.

hmedh5p,notveryvery,11/28/2021,3,How much interest is on the debt you’re carrying? If it’s not super high it may make sense to get to max retirement savings right away.   You also don’t say anything about other expenses but given the huge increase in salary I’d consider maxing your contributions right away then max an HSA (if your company has) next and invest it.
hmec3hp,SnooDonuts2973,11/28/2021,1,Yes this is good advice I wish I had the meeting documented. Also funnily enough they have forgotten to pay me before. I got a significant raise when they restructured positions but never signed anything. Other people did but I think they forgot me. I was missing money from two paychecks and had to go to HR several times before it was fixed. I was worried they wouldn’t give me my raise since I didn’t sign anything and everyone else did but they did and gave me back pay.
hme4par,International_Arm843,11/28/2021,3,why cant you compromise into the middle seems like you  want something new . That apple car ur talking about is still at the very least 5-8 years away. No prototype and mass production takes everything you have (ask Elon). Even if you order a brand new Tesla today youll be waiting 2-3 years till you get it. You can get a decent 2012 car that has everything your asking for except the new shinty toy feel. Dont go into this ALL or None mentality especially with something that is designed to get you from point A to B. Never buy a brand new car from a dealer...

hmdn385,DecentFart,11/28/2021,3,It is intentionally a pain in the butt. You have to call around and see if places can give you quotes. Maybe there is something available now but the last time I was shopping around for a procedure there was no easy website to find prices. I had to call around and not everywhere would give me a price. Atleast get a quote from two different places. Once you see how much the price can vary you will be very thankful you spent the time obtaining them.  Try talking to your health insurance company first. See if they have a tool for finding operation costs. Then still call around to see if your health insurance would actually be worse because the insurance companies guarantee a certain price for the procedure but some out of network place can do it for less than your deductible if you are paying cash.
hmdw06x,Invest2prosper,11/28/2021,1,That’s correct to maximize the tax deferral and account growth benefits it’s best to pay out of pocket with cash and let account balance grow over time.  It sucks to pay cash out of pocket but f you went with other healthcare insurance options you’d probably be paying it in form of higher monthly premiums.
hmea0ti,Sirwired,11/28/2021,3,A check can be dishonored long after the funds are available in your account.  When this happens the bank will take the money back even if it leaves you massively overdrawn.  There are lots of situations where it can be \*weeks\* before a bad check is found out.
hmdrbtv,zacce,11/28/2021,3,> So say I buy a 10k max bond each month it makes 700?    You cant purchase $10k each month. You can buy $10k each year. After 6 months interest rate resets to the new inflation rate which will be decided next April.
hmdbtfe,Outsaniti,11/28/2021,1,Technically if your interest rate is less than inflation and youre going to be getting a wage increase to keep up with inflation it would technically be a good idea to wait and then pay your loan off with money that is less valuable. If those things arent true then its probably correct to either pay it off asap or sell it.
hmdfeez,bent42,11/28/2021,1,Dont listen to that guy. Be 100% proactive. If the company is in the right somehow and you wait for them to pay a lawyer youre going to be on the hook for those attorneys fees.

hme6cvm,lordsocknose,11/28/2021,1,This is true to an extent but you have to account for the tremendous tax breaks you can receive if you invest in trad 401k trad IRA and HSA accounts. Other deductions like child and marriage deductions also come into account as well. Trad 401k likely helps those with higher income brackets to save more than those with lower avg gross income brackets as they can fit their upper echelons of income into a lower bracket and thus net a higher effective net income.

hmdcgik,ppardee,11/28/2021,1,Why are you thinking about spending $30 on what is literally a luxury when you havent covered the basics yet?? **Buy some freaking clothes!!**  This is gonna sound really judge-y and harsh but you sound like youre already making excuses not to workout.  The campus gym is not ideal and its inconvenient.  So does that mean that youre not going to go to the gym you sign up for when its inconvenient or imperfect? Whats stopping you from working out right now without a gym?    Most gym memberships go unused.  Only you can say whether you will use it or not - but most people think they will when they first sign up.  Is it worth it? Probably not.  But as long as theres no long-term contract and they dont have some absurdly complex cancellation process theres little risk to trying.    Now go buy some pants!

But this also falls into aesthetic as well like for example is one house in the front and one in back? or is it a side to side?  Front and back is the better choice because Youll live in the front while hiding your tenants in the back.

My company contributes $500 towards my HSA as well.   The deductible is $3k with the same out of pocket max so you’d be an idiot to do the ppo.

hmef1ud,Hon3y_Badger,11/28/2021,1,Honestly sounds like youre trying to take all of lifes joys and cram them into your 20s. That Tesla wont make your life remarkably better than a Toyota. Your money can only go so far you should be focusing on the most important things right now saving for a home in a HCOL area and investing for your future self. That new car can come in a decade when you own a home & have $250k in your retirement. There is so much value to your money right now and you shouldnt be investing anymore than needed in a depreciating asset.

hmdxbu1,smooferated,11/28/2021,0,Suddenly paying off debt can actually lower your credit in my experience.  Paying down debt I always recommend and living debt free is amazing!  It’s a bit of a balancing act.  They love you to live in debt and hate it if you have none! Fun game they play.   My theory is that monthly payments are no longer reported and you have too much available credit. Mine topped at 831 I believe.  After having zero debt credit score no longer matters aside from pursuing additional investments.  Edit: everyone comes out of the woodwork trying to get your money at that point as well! I’d also wait for a turn in the housing market if in America. It’s definitely at a peak.
hmdqln2,Futuremlb,11/28/2021,32,Microcenter is awesome.
hmdqg6c,VanillaLifestyle,11/28/2021,3,Ok well going forward maybe start doing your due diligence. When someone says do this or bad things might happen do it. When you buy a house get it inspected.
hmekobi,david_chi,11/28/2021,1,Bottom line is you probably bought more car than you should have and it stretched your monthly budget to the near brink.  The real answer is you should sell the car for something half the cost so that your monthly car payment becomes half or less than what it currently is.   Otherwise your options become basically robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Dip into stock and/or efund to pay off the car to free up monthly cash for kid/projects.  Or dip into it to pay for kid/projects expenses because you dont have enough monthly cash flow.   If you arent willing/able to get into a lesser priced car my approach personally in situations like these is 50/50.  Split things half from stock sale half from efund so that neither is drained entirely.
hmdqay7,llRickJamesll,11/28/2021,1,58%  😜
hmdhoxz,Cooky1993,11/28/2021,696,Also its worth remembering that just because its in a contract doesnt make it legal.  Unless she owes them some sort of training bond or some subsidy she got towards her education/tuition they dont have a leg to stand on as you cant claim back wages paid for hours worked.  Your states Labour board would be a good place to report this to as it sounds pretty damned illegal from here.

hmegbr6,AnonFuckCostco,11/28/2021,-1,Total withheld was around 25k. I do have the plans to store around another 5-8k for any surprise taxes that may come up. I do have a really great tax lady who does wonders for me as well.
hmejfn0,invenio78,11/28/2021,1,This.  They can fit a kid into the i20 (actually two without any problem).  If they want a new car they should save up and when they have the cash pay for it out of pocket.  The new car is not a necessity its a luxury purchase.  Luxury purchases should never cause you to go into debt.
hmdxxun,saltycod,11/28/2021,5,>I am a big believer in low or no deductible plans for this reason even if you’re relatively healthy.  Youre simply loaning your insurance company money at 0% interest to pay for future medical expenses. Whereas with an HDHP you have to pay up front sure but you get to keep the unspent healthcare costs and invest them into your own HSA with pre-tax dollars and let the wealth build for yourself instead of some corporation.
hmdy1di,DoomBot5,11/28/2021,3,Keep in mind that in most leases (check your own for confirmation) a late payment isnt even applied until the 5th of the month. Granted its not late enough for your situation but the landlord may be more understanding than you think.
hmdg1fx,impressive_specimen,11/28/2021,1,Direct deposit is the preference they just dont want to continue printing out the stub on payday like theyve done the past five years. Since the system of file keeping has been based on that combined with no printer or desire to have one and the preference to not have to add yet another login and password to deal with a paper check will make due.   Just one of those people who prefers to rely less on technology like some curmudgeonly old man.  Been using a small town bank from back home with an account that has a credit card attached which makes closing it out complicated. But theyve always been good so its fine to just keep open. And since its a checking account figured a savings account somewhere local would be an okay idea.
hmel66w,Ecstatic_Assumption5,11/28/2021,1,>https://walkerart.hiringthing.com/job/341472/project-photographer  yes! I reported to everyone I could from the bank to identity theft units and the FBI.

hme7akh,rightascensi0n,11/28/2021,-1,Don’t do it. Nothing is stopping him from breaking up with you and pocketing the money after he’s pressured you into it. You broke up before for a reason. It sounds like he’s stringing you along and trying to get the benefits of marriage (your money) without commitment. Even if he makes more money than you I bet lifestyle creep means that he’s not as financially savvy as he wants to appear. How do you know he didn’t get back together with you because he wanted to siphon your finances with paying for a new house you won’t own?   As for him saying it’s no different from renting you live at home with your parents so you don’t have to pay someone else’s mortgage. What’s the benefit of living with him when he can pull the rug out from under you any time he wants? You can afford a place of your own faster if you don’t spend money paying his mortgage. Also he mentioned you’d be living there in the short term “until you could afford a place of your own” so he has no intention to start a life with you where you’d have legal and financial protection (marriage depends on the state). He wants your money and wants to kick you out once he feels he can do better. Break up with him
hmdqn9j,Impossible-3006,11/28/2021,1,Depends if youre going to need the money and when. Might be a good time to make some Roth IRA contributions.
hme01hm,maedocc,11/28/2021,4,>but i dont know how to reach them? every conversation gets shot down. they wont budge on any suggestion out of principle. does anyone have experience here?  I get that youre frustrated but you have tried to have a conversation with them and they refuse to change.   You also seriously think it reasonable for your mom 60+ and unemployed for decades to work a low wage job when your dad makes $250k annually. Why? Theres no point.   Real talk: your parents own a house in the Bay Area that they can sell even in disrepair for a lot of money. Their retirement will likely be reliant on Social Security like millions of other seniors in America. I highly recommend that your dad not claim until 70 because hes the wage earner and his benefit will top out at 70 -- and your mom can claim her benefit based on 50% of his work history.   Ex: Dad at 70 gets $3000/mo. in SS and your mom gets $1500/mo. Together thats $4500/mo. while they wont have cash for expensive splurges thats a perfectly respectable amount of money to live on.   Ask your parents nicely to set up an online account at ssa.gov (google: my ssa) so they can see the benefits available. If your dad doesnt have an additional pension from a former job then thats the money theyre living on in retirement.   You cant force people to accept your advice Im afraid.
hmdi3gk,Danny_ODevin,11/28/2021,3,With only 1 semester left finish your degree. A bachelors is a general prerequisite for many jobs that will pay better than you currently make and potentially still lead to the career you want--whether through grad school starting low level and working your way up etc. It will benefit your career the most out of all your options.  Not to mention it is a bit late in your education to be waffling on your choice of major as switching majors now will set you back in both graduation time and debt. If you decide on a different career path you can re-enroll in that program and possibly fast-track it via the credits you have already completed.  Also living at home sounds like the smart option despite the hit to your love life. It is not uncommon nowadays for children to live at home into their mid-20s and future you will be glad you took the time to save that extra money/pay down your debt. I am staring at $150K student loan myself and it definitely makes my financial decisions more challenging.

hmdd1iz,uptimefordays,11/28/2021,1,Good furniture is much more expensive than IKEA. Stop by an independent furniture store sometime even lower end ones will have $4000-5000 couches. High end furniture shops dont have prices in the showroom cause if you have to ask you cant afford.
hmeiwwq,Comprehensive-Tea-69,11/28/2021,1,This is not good advice. It is information that tells you what banks are looking for so they can sell you a mortgage product. From a personal finance perspective you should not be looking to buy right now
hmdhqsu,justLouis,11/28/2021,1,You are saving for retirement which is already 5+ year timeline and over any extended period of time the market trends up and to the right. If you pulled out a regular savings does nothing against inflation. Your index funds will not go to 0 consider the market on sale for the short term. For the long term Your Roth is safe and if your funds went to 0 the world is gone by then and you have greater things to worry about.
hme7a6j,Advanced-Blackberry,11/28/2021,1,I didn’t mean yell at someone. I was referring to taking it up with insurance so his complaint is directed at the company that doesn’t pay. But now seeing that it’s a deductible issue anywys the insurance company is in the right as well and this is entirely on the OP. No blame should be passed around.
hmefkdo,nothlit,11/28/2021,1,> After federal taxes were withheld as well as my penalty the final check I received was for approximately $91000.  How much was withheld? Usually its just a flat 20% unless you instructed the 401k provider to withhold more. 20% is probably not sufficient withholding depending on how much other income you have. Just dont want you to be surprised if you end up owing more at tax filing time.

Im assuming that they tagged it less on accident. Might even be a different product ID vs what was on the tag.   They were supposed to charge $200 more for how the floor model is displayed. You should feel happy they honored the lower price.  Mistakes happen and you got a better deal than you should have.

hme6fwp,PriBake,11/28/2021,1,I usually do half but it depends on the year and what is happening this year I did less than I normally do just because of inflation and how everything went up in cost but I still made sure to do something. Always tell myself a little away is better than none
hmdq6e1,CQME,11/28/2021,2,Just walk in like you know what youre doing stick to your guns and dont let the dealer convince you of something you didnt plan for.  If you did your homework the dealer will usually respect your position and work with your numbers.  It cuts out a lot of unnecessary bullshit because like any salesman the dealer is looking to maximize their profit/commission and they have the best opportunity to do so with customers who have no idea what they are doing on that lot.  They will upsell those customers like you wouldnt believe (this is a general life tip BTW).  That being said Im sure you know its a sellers market right now.  The dealer can always find another customer if they dont like your numbers.
hme8ruy,Mjrcol01,11/28/2021,1,FYI your rating can be reduced over time... Especially the mental health aspect. The theory is after receiving treatment you should be getting better and would be receiving less treatment. Also dont forget to apply for your travel benefits to and from your appointments. You have 60 days right now to apply for past travel and can go through VA Access to apply for reimbursement. Depending on your location it can be a significant amount of money.

hmdemzg,7loUge,11/28/2021,1,I would at least as much of the loan as you can because the interest on the loan will drag out the repayment. I lived at home at about your age. I was surprised how many women I met had no problem with it. Some were even supportive and saw me as being responsible by paying off my debt while living at home. Ladies that had a problem with it really werent ones Id be interested in. Come to think of it during the period of living home I dated pretty regularly.

hme6tu6,tstill_,11/28/2021,1,I’m not sure what exactly the entire point of your post is?  1. You immediately talk about the advisors Age and Attractiveness: that seems more like you wanted a Date and not a financial advisor.  Like did you think by moving 100k he would be impressed and ask you out then when he started trying to do his actual job you were mad?  2.  You directly said you wanted assistance investing: in order to assist you they need to understand your whole financial situation that means understanding what else you have invested. Additionally he needs to know what your financial goals are so he can properly make recommendations.    3. You just moved that money there then immediately want to move it out? That probably set off red flags with the Advisor people don’t go to a bank and ask for help to move 100k into this new account then all of a sudden  get dodgy.   Are there shady advisors who will only push products that make them higher commissions? Absolutely. That is why you should make sure you are talking to a Fiduciary and not just salesman.   But you also can’t go to an advisor and expect free personalized investment advice without giving any details
hmea8h7,WantToRetireSomeday,11/28/2021,3,I cannot figure out how you came to those tax numbers.   Taxes on $80k using single standard deductions and 2022 brackets would be: Federal - $10500  Social Security - $4960 Medicare - $1520  Total Taxes - $16950  Net Pay- $63053

hmejj09,ronald_mcdonald_4prz,11/28/2021,1,Where did you get that from?
hmdcbnu,sasakuowo,11/28/2021,1,Yeah but I believe that’s only involving cases where the paycheck had an incorrect amount of money wrongful bonus etc.   In OP’s case they are paid an hourly rate. So their paycheck is legally correct as their current rate is the rate agreed to by both parties. The company could not go back and take money away and say it was an incorrect amount. The fault lies with the employer not adjusting the pay rate after the OP stepped down.
hmejp48,MangeLeBebe,11/28/2021,1,Understood. Sorry. Im not publicly disclosing how I got out of my lease because it is technically a breach of BMW Financial Services MVLA.
hmdr7gm,maartenvanheek,11/28/2021,1,Funny this just happened to us yesterday. Asked if the for bench inserted between two sofa pieces was included in the price (it was not) then got a quote that was €50 higher than the combined price tags. When we addressed this the saleswoman quickly pulled off the price tag and said it was a mistake and she can only give us this exact same model for this price. But since we opted for a different fabric in the same price range there was nothing she could do.  Also unlike other customers we werent offered coffee so we will sleep on it. My boyfriend then found out that the same sofa goes for 20-40% discounts at other times of the year so no need to rush to get this black Friday 15%.
hmeh5ks,AnonFuckCostco,11/28/2021,1,They’ve already sold everything out of that account and I have already received my paper check. How could I recover those penalties?
hmeakxt,SonOfMcGee,11/28/2021,1,I’ve heard that in certain industries like used cars the salespeople make a much bigger percentage commission on all the extras than they do on the base sale.
hme94yx,Billysmith007,11/28/2021,1,They will ask for the money back dont act like this is free money they will figure it out  the longer it goes the more money  you pay back .
hmdxxyq,darharhar113,11/28/2021,0,Here in New York if you are over paid the company is within their right to dock future pay. My company will deduct from your next check if the amount is more than 200$ they will work out a payment structure until the full amount is paid back.   I would check to see what the laws are where you are and if there is company policy in place. Be prepared to return the money until you learn otherwise.
hme34nc,schooli00,11/28/2021,7,I remember when the dealership was trying to sell me some rainx-ish coating for $400. Knew it was a scam when I jokingly replied will do it for $20 and they accepted.

hmehx0s,jamkot,11/28/2021,1,Imo crypto is essentially gambling. Would you charge $500 to a credit card or take out a loan to gamble? Pay off the credit card balance right away then keep an emergency fund and pay down the personal loans as you can.

hmeckt3,ErikRogers,11/28/2021,1,Here in Canada I can too. My bank does them for free though some banks charge. In the US services exist for that (like Venmo) but it depends if a landlord wants to accept it (and if a tenant is comfortable paying a landlord that way).
hmdccml,antheus1,11/28/2021,1,You probably worked hard to get that significant raise. Reward yourself for doing so. There is a middle ground between austerity and extravagance and I think most people are happier in that middle ground than the extremes. In a situation like this where a little more spend results in a significant increase in quality it’s worth it to spend a bit more I.e. don’t be penny wise and pound foolish.

hmej9y5,AnonFuckCostco,11/28/2021,1,Thanks for the actual info. I do have a tax person and will message them today. I haven’t yet told her all the moves I made this year in my financial life.   I didn’t necessarily tap into this to pay bills. I did start a business and it’s currently paying all my monthly expenses. I more tapped in as I didn’t want it tied up with my past employer I wanted enough liquid cash to purchase a truck outright for my business and I guess the cushion and emergency savings.
hmdfg84,TrainedCodeMonkey,11/28/2021,1,I see what you’re saying. She wouldn’t and doesn’t expect to get that in the same way I’m not splitting the gains with a tenant. I took the risk and she knows that and won’t share the loss either. Of course some context of our situation is worthwhile knowing to. I’m not running a business off my SO. She lived with me for 12 months rent free and just split groceries in a shoebox apartment before “we” bought the house. She was happy to move into a house with me that was cheaper than me renting a more expensive apartment at half the size which was also true for her.   At the end of the day we’re human and make human decisions. I’m not running my relationship like a business. Fair is often decided from the perspective of emotion. Right or wrong it doesn’t matter. We’re thinking forward. She’s saving money and so am I. I look out for her because her success is mine too and vice versa. Any strong financial talks before marriage are good in my opinion and I’m glad your situation worked for you. We’re hoping the same for us!
hme4q9m,NoMoLerking,11/28/2021,2,I guess I should clarify that I’m only talking about people with money.    When you’re poor skimming ketchup from Wendy’s feels bad but most things feel bad so it’s hard to say.
hme6rbl,93195,11/28/2021,3,No you should not pay half his mortgage.  At most you should pay rent equal to a mid priced 1 BR apartment.  And if that’s too much just keep living with parents like you do now.  His mortgage is not your problem.
hme1lnz,Jokong,11/28/2021,1,Not industry but commission sales.  I own a furniture and no one works on commission.  There is no pressure to buy no add on items and prices are straight forward.

hmekapr,snowednboston,11/28/2021,1,This is a *want* not a **need**. Emergency funds are for **needs**.  Your house is not going to crumble apart if it’s not painted within the next 12mos. If it does actually crumble then paint wasn’t the cure to begin with.

hmdpk94,Leading-Stable9725,11/28/2021,1,Thank you for the reply. Obviously some risks of vacancies. Will look into the loan schedules further.   Could you possibly expand on you last comment? “Other options” We have investigated buying a small piece of land to eventually build a house to retire on way outside the city in a nice mountain town and just renting here. For the long run with rent control our rent is very low for what we have. But trying to think more of other options to move forward with since it is so ridiculous here to own. Thanks for the advice.
hme130y,too_too2,11/28/2021,2,Since OP is in the US he should definitely be able to request copies of his records. He would need to call and probably fill out a “release of information” form and request copies and they may charge him a fee but normally they don’t in my experience.

They use a different scale (score range even varies by bureau) and weigh things differently than most FICO models that people encounter regularly.  You could be in for an enormous surprise (good or bad) when you see yours.
hmel6n8,Frozenlazer,11/28/2021,1,This was going to be my guess to. The actual scam comes later when they get your card info to refund the purchase.
hme1qun,nnelson2330,11/28/2021,1,>Yes. In most states if a product is mislabeled cheaply they have to sell it to you for that price.   This is just emphatically untrue. Every state has laws protecting businesses from having to honor mislabeled prices. If you can prove the intent to deceive you can sue them for false advertising but no business is required to honor any price prior to the point of sale.
hmdwhad,Arashi3xx,11/28/2021,1,Ok thank you this demonstration helped me alot do you happen to know any other ways to have your money make more for you?
hmdp06o,EfficientRevolution,11/28/2021,4,It can make sense if you are willing to do the work of being a landlord in exchange for the rent you can collect. Another factor to consider is whether you are prepared to weather the risks of being a landlord - someone who bought and rented out a duplex in February 2020 might have gone without rent since March or April and only recently gotten back a severely damaged unit. Thats basically the worst case scenario but its certainly possible.      >how long are you realistically looking at before you can re-finance and go buy a house to live in?      What needs to happen for you to be able to go buy a house for you to live in? Are you going to be using the paid equity and appreciation from the duplex as a down payment? You can estimate that by looking at how the loan amortization and market conditions but you wont be able to get an exact answer.      If your goal is to be in a house or condo ASAP then buying a duplex probably doesnt make sense and youve got a different question of whether you want to buy a house in your current location or consider other options that dont involve a $4-5k mortgage.
hmenjg2,Werewolfdad,11/28/2021,1,Your incomes are close enough that it likely does not matter unless one of you can itemize
hmefbny,RyuFancypants,11/28/2021,10,I dont know anything about business accounts but if you are planning on investing 40-50k of the 401k anyway why would you cash it out and take the penalty?  Roll it over to a Traditional IRA and ONLY take out what you absolutely need for this new phase of your life. Less penalties less fees less taxes. And you still preserve some of your retirement for the future.

hmehnj3,sideefx2320,11/28/2021,1,Man get yourself a great lender and you’ll have no problem with affordability. I have a similar net worth with  slightly less income. I bought a house last year after cold calling 10+ lenders quizzing them on everything. The guy I ended up working with knew every trick in the book. I’m self employed and got a conforming conventional jumbo loan at 2.89% 30yr fixed.   Pro tip: Wait to do your taxes until you’ve gotten everything on there approved by the lender.
hmegdqa,cafeconmichael,11/28/2021,1,You’re doing great. Try to find a job that will pay for you to go to grad school. I know companies such as Wells Fargo and AT&T will do tuition reimbursement. I’m sure there are several others.  Save and invest networking doesn’t need to be done at school. Get in the right social circles go to events in your community. Check out when the chamber of commerce holds meetings in your city and go mingle.  Save. Invest. Budget correctly(which seems like you’re doing just fine there)  Networking is free

hme7mic,Advanced-Blackberry,11/28/2021,0,You sound like a shite patient for criticizing docs for not being insurance experts.  I want my physician to know what’s best for me. Apparently your criteria is insurance knowledge. They could be fantastic at everything else but you’d think they suck because they don’t understand whatever shitty plan you walked in with. Nice criteria there.    Plans are complicated and insurance is very bad about giving good information on coverage. My dermatologist office doesn’t let me pay on day of service because it all needs run thru insurance first because they don’t trust the information given to them. I work in healthcare the info given is not always accurate.
hmeapcr,sicbot,11/28/2021,3,If they only have $220 extra a month they cant afford a house. They cant save up enough for a down payment or a emergency fund to pay for stuff that breaks (big appliances roof plumbing etc.)
hmdig8x,doctorpot1,11/28/2021,5,Just email back and say you are getting advise from Ministry of Manpower (MOM). Usually they will backoff. When my friend resigned his company also demanded a lot of unreasonable request such as asking for the other companys contract. He replied that he will seek advise from MOM and they backed off and future emails are damn polite.

hmdekf3,Critical-Cell-3064,11/28/2021,1,My company uses a website called insperity for pay stubs. It’s actually really easy and you can go back like a year and reprint pay stubs.   If you really don’t want to use direct deposit maybe a credit union is your best bet. Or just use a bank like chase or something for a checking account that has a Phisical location  and then you can still get a online HYSA like Marcus. You can also deposit your checks directly into the Marcus HYSA through their app.  I’ll add that direct deposit is much less of a hassle for everyone. You could always try one of these banks out and switch to another one if you don’t like it or find a better option. Wells Fargo is just a crappy bank and I used them for a long time. Good luck to you

I now see that the point i think youre making is you dont think itll work out between us because were not financially even etc.  I dont think thats a reason to end a relationship.  I did come to the internet for advice as I dont have experience with these things. Im autistic and have my own ideas about things that others sometimes disagree with.

hmdmayl,MrCrow9000,11/28/2021,-2,No sounds like they didnt... Also listing to the professional is not a sound strategy.   There are many people out there willing to scam you or your insurance out of more money just because they can.  Get some extra opinions from other doctors if you want.

hmemlkz,j-christopher,11/28/2021,1,That was an honest observation from someone whos been in a lopsided financial relationship.    Two of them actually (and Ive been on both sides).  Someone is always aggrieved.   Youre asking strangers on Reddit to mediate a financial dispute with someone with whom youve been romantically entangled for five years and that doesnt bode well for the future.  If you didnt want honest responses you should have specified that.
hmejs3o,RO489,11/28/2021,1,Yep thats another factor 3x your salary for a house means different things if you factor in a down payment.   I love on a hcol so its all a stretch for people around here. And thats OK it just means you cant also have 25% going to cars for example.

hmdcw4q,JonnyManhattan,11/28/2021,1,Of course and Im not implying that it wasnt. No employer should expect any money from you during the initial employment period because they havent paid you any money. Employers would also never put a financial burden on someone new because it would be a fucking deal breaker. Its a new world with remote work and its going to be a paradise for scammers so I feel for OP.

hmek6me,eziern,11/28/2021,1,Call the hospital and tell them you can’t pay that amount. Offer to pay like $200 cash now to pay it off. See if they will accept it. Mention you want to pay it but you just don’t have the means now. They may try and negotiate give them a little wiggle room.   See if that works? They can technically do that but depends on their organizational needs/structure for said tasks. The messed up part is the $700 is probably still with the negotiated insurance rate versus non-insured rate.
hmemg3l,OrneryTortoise,11/28/2021,1,A lot of comments here the to a cashiers check. Years ago I was told by my bank that what I wanted was a certified. The difference was that certified meant that funds were being held by the bank to pay that check the cashiers check not so. Dont take my word on this - ask your bank as rules and definitions may have changed. Good luck.
hmekvrx,Frozenlazer,11/28/2021,1,Interest is.charged as you go  based on the amount you currently still owe.  So short answer the sooner you pay off the less interest you pay.  Heres how monthly interest charge is calculated. Amt owed x interest rate / 12.  So if you owe 25000 at 5% interest for that month is 25000 x .05 / 12 = 104.17.   If the next month you make a payment of 5104.17 and reduce the balance to 20000 then the next interest charge is 83.33  And that just goes on month after month until you take the balance to 0

hmdpxjw,HIM_Darling,11/28/2021,1,Maybe you know. I had a punch biopsy done at my dermatologist office in June. Paid upfront for it then when I received the explanation of benefits it showed they covered everything except my copay. I contacted my insurance first they looked over the EOB and said if I had paid more than what it said I owed I should contact the office for a refund. So I contacted the derm office and they refunded me.      2 weeks ago(5 months later) I got a notification that 2 new explanation of benefits were available to view. I pulled them up and both are for the same date of service back in June one is identical to the original EOB and the other shows I owe the amount that I was originally refunded. I contacted the insurance company and they claim it was coded wrong but now corrected and actually the full visit wasnt covered. When I look at both EOBs they dont look any different and no reason shows as to why previously it was considered covered but now is not.  I havent received a bill or any communication from the derm office. Should I be expecting something? Is it normal for something to be changed like that? Seems super shitty/shady that they are allowed to change their minds after saying it was covered especially when they are the ones who told me to ask for a refund.
hmembpl,Motobugs,11/28/2021,1,So should take consideration of future breakup. Obviously hes doing that.
hmehdzs,classicalL,11/28/2021,1,Of course it doesnt. Im saying that most non-profits that offer 2 accounts are doing that to segregate their contributions from yours and pre and post tax.
hmdcpye,slayer1am,11/28/2021,1,Never hurts to invest and make some free money.    Put a good chunk into a high dividend fund/stocks and you could a healthy passive income stream.
hmdn1r2,Alis451,11/28/2021,2,no they have to pay you for any overages you can take it in the form of a check just like if you close a bank account they zero it out and send a check.
hmdorc5,AssassinPhoto,11/28/2021,1,Pay the debt - mortgage will factor in the debt and reduce your allowable limit by that much  Example  - approved for 250k mortgage  but have 7k in CC debt you’ll only actually get approved for 243

hmemt42,International_Arm843,11/28/2021,1,seems like ur mind is already made up OP having read thru the thread everyone is telling you the same thing and u keep looking for wiggle room. You might just have to take this hit to learn the lesson i wish you well...
hmem6kc,Psychonautic339,11/28/2021,1,Well always be able to move back into our parents houses. Also if selling wasnt an option we could always rent it out. The house in question is £190k its a chapel conversion it has 5 bedrooms 2 bathrooms a loft conversion and a massive cellar. I think its an absolute steal.  I dont see how I can do it on my own only earning £20k. Id have to borrow 8.75× my salary. My uncle is willing to help by being guarantor but he wont just hand over the money.
hmeczji,ThekingofShibauni777,11/28/2021,2,I reccomend using a credit card and I know thats not my money so Im less inclined to spend it I leave my debit cards at home and save quite a but more weekly with this tactic plus well earning the cashback rewards this does take displine but in case of fruad your credit card company will most likely have to cover you.
hmee553,fabulousfred,11/28/2021,1,Dont buy this car without starting it and letting it get hot.  All cars sound different cold and allowing the vehicle to warm completely will reveal its flaws.  Noisy engine smoke slipping transmission leaks failing AC -- all of these problems are masked by a cold condition.   Once its nice and hot roll down the windows turn off the air and radio and try driving/turning a very tight circle both to the left and right all while listening to the front.  There should be very little squealing and no tick-tick sounds (CV joints).   Finally after your road test let the car sit and idle for another 20 minutes.  Look at the tailpipe for smoke check the AC for at least a 20 degree split in temperature (if its 90 outside the AC should blow around 70 degrees).  Lift the hood and look.  Is the engine smoking?  Is it making unusual sounds?  If all of this is too much for you ask a mechanic to check the vehicle for you.  Better to know the flaws BEFORE you negotiate price.  Have fun with all that!
hmelb83,bros402,11/28/2021,1,so if your doctor told you lets scan your entire body to see if anything is going on during a physical youd expect that to be covered to?  the echo is diagnostic not wellness   this is what is generally considered parts of a physical - https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/annual-physical-examinations

hmddozn,ERCOT_Prdatry_victum,11/28/2021,1,If it was me at the very least I would be interviewing lawyers.  Giving the company a specific date to respond with their justification for paying back anything. You will get some knowledge from those interviews.

hmde8uq,intraregularity,11/28/2021,1,All I did was transfer some money from my bank’s chequing account into my credit card account as if I’m paying a credit card bill.   I get you though I did this back when I got a student credit card with a limit of only like $500 and I had to transfer a couple hundred bucks or more into it to essentially bump up the limit for the occassional larger purchases.

I mean I reported this everywhere I could think of so I should be fine right?
hmde1kk,Billsrealaccount,11/28/2021,1,I know a person who got a 750k settlement from a company that caused a car accident where he nearly lost his ear (looks fine now) and a friend died in the accident.  Id tell them 5 mil and see what happens from there.  You have nothing to lose from starting high.
hmdcooa,VegasOldPerv,11/28/2021,1,I have no clue what you are trying to say.   A credit score is not designed for you or me. It is designed to help lenders assess their risk exposure in lending you money or extending you credit. It is a tried and true indication of the likelihood that we will pay our bills. That can extend to responsibility with rent and insurance also. If you have zero credit then that risk factor is unknown. You could be denied or charged extra without a credit score.
hmdcw2i,m3003,11/28/2021,1,Where do you think the dealership starts their pricing? Yeah thats right...from the pricing guides. Some are selling for more some are selling for less and you get the average ranges...

hmej9vk,2wheels30,11/28/2021,1,You know just a little more than a decade ago this would have resulted in being incredibly upside down in a mortgage right?

Encouraging people to buy property as leveraged as possible at a time when inventory is at record lows and property values at record highs seems...not the best way to build wealth.

hmekq3e,CostofRepairs,11/28/2021,1,Depends on the s term of the loan. With 800+ credit a two-year term should be doable.  Might ask for some of that 15k in a CD as collateral.   Uncollateralized personal loan will have higher interest though.  Early pay penalty depends on terms of loan. At a reputable institution though likely no penalty as you’ll pay fees up front of at pay off.  Might need three months to avoid penalty though.
hmddr59,7loUge,11/28/2021,1,Not sure what you mean by personal growth. You can live at home pursue interests and have friends. You can also consider what you want to do with your life career-wise while living at home. Theres little shame in it especially at a young age as yours.   Dont let living at home convince you that you cant grow as a person and dont let living at home convince you that you dont need to grow as a person. Take the time to pay down your debt and think about the future some. Thats my advice.
hmdf2eo,bent42,11/28/2021,1,Thats bad advice. If you wait for them to get a lawyer involved and it does turn out that the company is in the right OP is going to be on the hook for attorneys fees.
hmdg4sy,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,1,Exactly this I believe my wife working in sales has hardly to do with this situation as they are requesting her entire 8 months of base salary back as well.

hmdw9ln,999uts,11/28/2021,2,Try to make a rainy day fund (3-6 months is okay) incase of emergency (losing job etc) esp if your investment is hard to liquidate. You are in a good start just keep investing the amount that you wont need immediately.
hmenft7,Waldemar-Firehammer,11/28/2021,1,Generally speaking you get a better tax rate by filing jointly. A fiduciary should be able to better telly you what to do for your specific situation.
hmdf4rw,MongoBongoTown,11/28/2021,1,Been in Enterprise IT Sales for a decade plus. No one does this and its entirely stupid.  There are some (see: very few) claw-backs on guaranteed commission ramps for the first few months/quarters. But never anywhere near the total base salary. If they only paid her base and are now asking for it back its absolute horseshit.  If youre paying someone ~$70k a year theres no company in the world that would reasonably expect a short term employee to be able to pay back $56k. Theyd spend way more money on legal fees than theyd ever hope to get back.
hmegpxy,Nagisan,11/28/2021,2,You just asked one of the big questions to retirement thats almost impossible to fully predict.    You can account for it if youre careful and know exact amounts but honestly at that point the effort required isnt worth bothering to figure that out *to me*. Id rather just save an amount I know I can manage if I come in over that due to inheritances or anything - itll just add to my retirement income and Ill pay more in tax. At that point Ill have enough that I dont care if I have to pay more in tax.    So unfortunately I dont really have a great answer for you on how to calculate and account for that. To me that gets into amounts of money high enough that my mind says who cares if you pay more tax in retirement as a result? You have enough to live very comfortably regardless... but thats going to be a very personal answer that others may not share.    But yes that amount would likely go towards taxable income (IIRC *earned* income is different as it requires a job that pays not just money coming in via investments or such). Unless of course these funds are in Roth accounts and therefore not taxable (but then IIRC you have to pull all the money out within 5 years of inheriting it).

I can’t pay $700 to make sure I’m good”? While I understand that you are upset at the cost you can ALWAYS ask if they can give you a discount or allow you to make affordable payments.

hmeisve,LesterTheOne,11/28/2021,1,When I bought my house I tried to do 401k loan for buying a house. It just sat there for a week or two no change. I’m going off memory from 6 years ago but it ended up being the status wouldn’t change until I had the closing paperwork or something like that. I couldn’t get the moment until the deal was done basically.  I ended up canceling my 401k home loan(whatever called) and just getting a general purpose loan from them. Had it in 3 days.   I just realized you did a hardship.   I did a partial hardship for coronavirus last year and had the money in a few days 3-4.   It generally doesn’t take long to get loans withdraws etc from a 401k in my experience.   I’d keep calling every day. Be a pain in the ass. It’s your money.   This was all probably no real help to you but I would definitely keep calling.
hmde4ub,Cowboywizzard,11/28/2021,1,Most good doctors offices can give you a list of local imaging clinics. If not googling can find local imaging centers that do MRIs and you can just ask your physician to call them. If your doctor refuses you should find a new doctor. I do it all the time.
hme8eqp,woollywhelk,11/28/2021,1,All gyms are hard to cancel. PF was easier for me to cancel than LA Fitness but still requires a certified letter.
hmea5ee,mtkaliz,11/28/2021,1,Always say something if you think your pay is wrong. Imagine if they had forgotten to pay you - you would speak up right quick. Do the exact same if the shoe is on the other foot.   However in this case I do not believe that they made a mistake. In the interview where you agreed with HR and your manager to step away from being a supervisor they should (or you should) have brought up salary. Since no one did AND if the meeting was documented you can safely assume that your pay isn’t changing.   About that documentation - every time you meet with HR and your boss either request documentation of what was discussed OR send out an email outlining your understanding of what was discussed. EVERY TIME.   Good luck!
hmehdep,rymep,11/28/2021,1,Yup the change is only theoretical until you actually sell something.  Thats why I still have all my Enron stock.  I just know theyre going to beat these legal troubles and Ill be laughing my way to the bank.

hmel9xu,International_Arm843,11/28/2021,1,ur plan seems sound OP only thing i would say is make sure you hold those stocks for over 12 months so you can only pay a 15% cap gains instead of the 25%

hmejg41,crazykid01,11/28/2021,1,use it as a offset to gains as others said but also if you dont have any gains to offset you can hold onto the stock.   If you believe it will go back up within 5-10 years that is an option.   If you are getting dividends from the stock you can keep those and re-invest it into some other stock.   You can also sell the stock and re-invest it into another stock that has performed well OR is likely to grow more w/ dividends/increases in price.
hmenl88,RubyRidgebackmomma,11/28/2021,1,Any credit cards used between when you applied and finally close will trigger a new report to be pulled and very well could affect your current closing. Be careful.
hmeibrr,nautilator44,11/28/2021,1,Yeah my employer has an HDHP but then gives you most of the deductible in an HSA every year so its a better deal.
hmeak8j,ticktock76,11/28/2021,7,You are thinking of an FSA. Flex Spending Accounts are very limited in what you can roll over and even what you roll over you usually have to use for expenses incurred in the year you contributed.   A Health Savings Account is different. HSA’s are used similar to FSAs but are only available to folks with high deductible health insurance and allow the money to grow year over year as an investment.
hmeg5gu,AnonFuckCostco,11/28/2021,-7,The money and penalties are already paid and hindsight isn’t going to bring back those penalties. I appreciate your time but would prefer only feedback on my questions i asked.
hme05rd,Fletchonator,11/28/2021,1,I do local travel. I don’t make that much. I only work two days a week (get enough pay for that to suffice). I do this because I’m a single dad. In terms of travelers making 10k… those are crisis contracts often in places often in places like California were they get ravaged by taxes. Moreover there are no crisis contracts that pay that much for 3 days a week. 600 bucks a month is steep for market place insurance. It’s not me being cheap believe me. Also these insurances are so convoluted when it comes to explanation of benefits. I’ve seen it time and time again when patients come into the ER and have some .gov insurance and it doesn’t cover the stay and it costs 1k just for them to walk in the door and I’m sure even more for diagnostics. Im glad you automatically jumped to the conclusion that I’m a cheap idiot without any details. Good job generating such a summary of my life with such little detail !
hmeh0ty,ejly,11/28/2021,1,Do the plans have different vesting periods?
hme2hwk,ShinyHappyMeeples,11/28/2021,0,Had this happen to me over a decade ago at a job. They never reduced my pay after I stepped down from being a supervisor I didn’t say anything expecting at some point they’d realize their mistake and my paycheck would just be lower one day. They eventually figured it out something like a year later right as I was about to quit so I didn’t stay long enough to care. They never gave me my last paycheck though so presumably they took it from that. I suspect I could’ve fought against that but it’s been so long now and it’s not worth the time and effort it’d take to recoup (it was a reduced paycheck anyways for a fraction of a pay period).
hmduz06,Pass_Little,11/28/2021,3,Call the landlord.   Explain the situation explain youll be able to pay on the 8th.  Pay your half if at all possible.  Assuming theyre a reasonable landlord theyll be fine.   Might be a small late payment fee but it will be better than any other option.  Just dont make it a habit.  It also sounds like you need to spend some time with the document at [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and the graphical version of it at [https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png)  Although I wasnt lucky enough to have it all written out for me once I discovered the importance of following the steps detailed in those documents the problems you describe in this post completely disappeared.     In particular prioritizing building a $1K emergency fund over any non-essential purchases is critical to being able to handle these types of emergencies.

hme7kq3,mikasax,11/28/2021,1,Good to know about the lender change.  When I bought my car the bank asked me about the loan transfer.  I guess it looked like a refi on their end I have a feeling this will impact my credit.  The life of these revolving accounts will be close and it will show up as net new loan starting the clock again.  Can anyone speak to the credit portion of my question?
hmdbt9g,Serious-Speaker4668,11/28/2021,1,Was this a FaceTime call? Odd you’re focusing on appearance. Are you a female or gay? Define young? And what does age have to do with advice? Why not provide helpful information like his qualifications.   Without you sharing relevant facts or your goals you’ve set yourself up to receive a bunch of irrelevant answers.   It sounds like you don’t want to pay 1% for investment management. Fine - plenty of other options out there. What is your background and how do you rate your knowledge of financial planning. Or are you purely interested in buying alpha for your portfolio? Perhaps you don’t know how to evaluate risk and return or align investment to achieve your goals.   What happened in the rest of the conversation? Tell us about your estate plan what you’re doing to mitigate taxes did either of you evaluate if you have adequate protection do you have in place?   Good luck and don’t fuck up 😬
hme1dj0,too_too2,11/28/2021,1,Yeah this seems very weird I had to get an echo once when I was younger and had bad insurance. It was definitely a separately scheduled procedure and it was at the hospital vs the office. Also I’ve worked for a hospital system for many years and I agree with the other poster this is a little fishy.  You should request copies of your records from this office and go to a totally different place and see if there was even any reason to run an EKG or echo in the first place.
hmddh8z,yellowcanvas,11/28/2021,1,I mostly live in sweatpants and sweatshirts right now because I’ve gained weight since getting injured. But i did get some clothes that were on sale for black friday!  I go for runs and do bodyweight exercises but I used to lift a lot when I had a home gym. Yes the campus gym is inconvenient but the hoards of creepy frat boys that approach girls and film us working out are the main deterrent. There aren’t any creeps at the gym i was thinking of joining according to my couple friends who go there and it’s a small but close community.
hme9nqr,spacemark,11/28/2021,2,While I think this is great in terms of minimizing risk this sets a very high bar does it not? One that very few can meet in todays market?  Edit: just looked it up only 1/4 of first time home buyers put 20% down. So the number of people that meet all three of your rules is probably less than 10%. Not that its a bad rule. Just out of reach for most.
hmdtd8t,FourthPrince-4040,11/28/2021,1,The less debt you have the more appealing you will look to the mortgage officer( also good credit). Also take a good look at your budget to see if you can cut back. Lastly tax season is coming if you usually get a refund pay off your debt. If buying your house is a serious choice. Also make sure you have an emergency before you commit to anymore debt.
hme9u8k,atomic081,11/28/2021,1,Maybe.   I had a similar thing happen but I think it was no scam. I was 22 and had bought my first house. I wanted a nice leather couch set. I had found one at a local furniture chain for 7200.  That was more than I was willing to spend but kept coming back to this couch as I didn’t like anything else. 2 months later I’m in a neighboring city with time to spare and see this same chain. The couch set I wanted had a tag for 2400.   The salesman told me it was marked wrong but they would honor it if I purchased at that point. If I walked out they wouldn’t honor it anymore.  I couldn’t write that check fast enough. I still have that couch 18 years later!
hmebq7x,nothlit,11/28/2021,1,The bottom line is the check can *appear* to be cleared (whatever most people think that means) but can still be reversed if the bank later finds out it was a bad/fake/forged/fraudulent check. This is the gap in common understanding that allows this scam to thrive.
hme6eq5,vgacolor,11/28/2021,6,> I want to move in next year when its finished being built     If you want to move in then the real question is if the amount requested is unreasonable. At first glance the 50% request sounds reasonable but is it too much on your income?  What can you afford?  How much would it cost you to live on your own by renting from a third party?  Can you afford that amount?       Time to do some math and come back with if it is rent then this is how much I can afford
hmdfj2x,Starbuck_trustno1,11/28/2021,1,You only have $12k in medical bills?
hmegs5c,OkTicket5973,11/28/2021,1,What do you need help with? There’s no question. How much do you spend on eating out and bars? How old are you? You can’t get your 20s back so you shouldn’t live like a frugal saint if you’re gonna sacrifice your social life

hme8vlx,woollywhelk,11/28/2021,2,It depends and there is no way for us to know what will happen. Usually employee options are common stock so in an acquisition event the preferred stock holders (founders and investors) are bought out and paid first. Depending on how much debt the company has common stock may be worth something or not.

hme5f4i,Paroxysm111,11/28/2021,1,Theyre usually just an extension of the warranty against manufacturing defects. Anything you dont find in the first month of using something is going to be very hard to prove as a manufacturer defect. So if they can find any excuse for why it doesnt count as a manufacturing defect like saying its the result of wear and tear they can just tell you to pound sand.
hmdflue,retirementinsanity,11/28/2021,1,Just a little addition since the social security question is answered. You should also go to https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs and see how the rates are going since the premium will be auto-deducted from the social security check. In 2022 the base rate is $170.10 for part B.   And of course you need to keep in mind where you are in relation to the taxability of social security payments.
hme45n4,MountainStoneMist,11/28/2021,3,Speak with HR or a benefits counselor. I am guessing you have a 403(b) 401(k) and a 457(b) plan. All of these plans can be similar to a 401(k) but each have their own rules and minor differences.  Your annuity might be a 403(b) and the deferred compensation plan is another name for a 457(b) plan.   [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/403bplan.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/403bplan.asp)  https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/10/403b-questions-answered.asp  [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/457plan.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/457plan.asp)  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp  [https://www.fool.com/retirement/plans/403b/403b-vs-457b/](https://www.fool.com/retirement/plans/403b/403b-vs-457b/)  Investing in 401ks and 457bs tends to be straight forward because you can usually choose from target date funds mutual funds bond funds etc.  A 403(b) can get a little trickier. For starters a 403(b) is also known as a tax-sheltered annuity. Investing in a 403(b) can be as simple as target date funds mutual funds bond funds similar to the 401k and 457b. A 403(b) can also be invested in a fixed or variable annuity which tend to have high fees and high surrender charges. Some employers let you choose between several 403(b) providers and depending on which one you choose will determine the type of investment products they offer (mutual funds fixed or variable annuity).  [https://investorjunkie.com/retirement/highest-fees-403b-accounts/](https://investorjunkie.com/retirement/highest-fees-403b-accounts/)  Side note: Some of your plans may allow Roth contributions. Roth contributions are made with post-tax money traditional contributions are made with pre-tax money.

hmeilgq,j-christopher,11/28/2021,1,Be very careful with credit union car financing.    Most likely your account agreements membership agreement and/or loan agreements have a cross-collateralization clause.  So if you default on a $1000 credit card account and later pay off the car you wont get the title until youve settled the credit card matter.  They can also repossess the car even if you are current on your car payments.
hmejmnr,Psychonautic339,11/28/2021,1,If we break up I guess we sell the house and go our separate ways. It would be a major bummer but I dont think it would be the end of the world... or maybe Im just being young and naive 😬  On my own I could only borrow around £90-100k
hmejav0,mdesaul,11/28/2021,1,This isn’t just with Credit Unions. This is with any bank or CU. If you have accounts with them and default they have rights of offset.   In reality it is really no different then getting a loan from a bank you don’t have accounts with and defaulting.  If you don’t have accounts at said bank they will sue and can garnish whatever accounts you do have.   The morale of the story here is pay your bills (like the OP says they do) and they won’t have any problems.
hmdf1q3,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,1,Yeah man no description or nothing. Just a memo via emailing saying to send 56k in funds to this company bank account and address. When we asked what is this for - no response since. Been 2 weeks.
hme4wu5,corecomps,11/28/2021,2,Im late to the party but what Ive done is save half (retirement) and spend half on every pay raise Ive recieved since starting at $32767/year back in 99.  It has allowed me to save for the future while still allowing myself to take pleasure in the income growth Ive seen.  I came from an ultra conservative family would would have saved it all and always lived on my starting wage. I also have friends that have zero saved and spend everything they have. I feel it is a nice compromise.
hmebpkq,Hon3y_Badger,11/28/2021,1,My dad had a similar problem when he moved to a new area of the country for his own business. His circumstances are different from yours in that he was able to bring 50% of the value of the new house as a check at closing. But he talked to the bank he does his business out of. They were much more accommodating than a national bank and ended up just keeping the loan in house to keep a good client happy. I cant say that solves all your problems but if you have a local bank you already have a relationship with they will be far more accommodating than a national bank.
hme5s4l,93195,11/28/2021,3,Sell the Hyundai get a slightly newer and bigger used vehicle not the new Peugeot.  This isn’t “all or nothing”.
hmdezdg,BernieMP,11/28/2021,1,Check with both your dr and insurance company to check if you would need a prior authorization from your provider before getting the scan sometimes drs dont pay attention to that stuff and sometimes your insurance company would just process whatever comes into their system as-is
hme5bru,MajorEstateCar,11/28/2021,1,I think it’s probably true. The mistake couldn’t be fixed by the salesperson so they had to escalate and management shut it down. That salesperson wanted the sale and probably fought like hell yelling the “dumb Jerry fucked up the pricing tags again that fucker should have to pay the difference for me to get the deal!”
hmejpwn,j-christopher,11/28/2021,1,It was an example of how shit can go sideways if you dont have money in savings and have to rely on credit cards to survive.  You dont need to be continuously employed in a decent job to pay the bills you just have to make more than you spend over the long run.  A savings account (with credit cards as a backup) is basically two moats around your castle instead of one.  You want as many moats as you can build.
hmdfssw,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,1,Thanks for keeping this conversation fruitful! When I say employment contract I should have instead just used the words W2 employee. Sorry about that!
hmddeca,muricasbootysnatcher,11/28/2021,1,to expand ask your utility company how much it is since x date(when you took ownership) and pay that. forward the remaining to your atty to deal with previous owner.
hme8y4w,EWCM,11/28/2021,2,>Will the VA change her benefits based on my income?   Disability benefits are not reduced based on income. Her benefit would actually increase as you would be an additional dependent.  >Will any other of her benefits change (forced to use my insurance etc)?  It sounds like she would qualify for Priority 1 VA healthcare. That is unaffected by income. There are priority groups connected to income but those are for people without disability ratings or very low disability ratings.   If you add her to your insurance she is supposed to inform the VA. She can still use the VA but they will bill the insurance company to recoup the cost of covered services.  >Will I still be able to claim her as a dependant? Filing Married or Separate? (she doesnt file now)  It usually doesn’t make sense to claim a spouse as a dependent. Filing as Married Filing Jointly doubles your standard deduction and most tax brackets so that could considerably decrease your tax burden.
hmdckqg,Varathien,11/28/2021,1,Is the income really not relevant? Because if its not then why is she doing this job if she hates it? What kind of jobs would she actually enjoy doing?
hmduvv2,Ecstatic_Being8277,11/28/2021,3,Yes have the experience.  Unfortunately the experience is:  If they do not want to change they will not change!   You need to focus on yourself.  Any efforts put into getting them to change is only going to be frustration and stress on you.  You do not need that.

hmeath7,SnooDonuts2973,11/28/2021,1,Well in my case it kind of put them in a bad spot. We basically have 4 tiers and I was one of the most experienced person in tier 4. All of the current employees are either 12 or 4– I’m now the only 3. I let go of a lot of responsibility and time commitment but I’m still technically trained in all of the 4 areas for now.
hmen21j,j-christopher,11/28/2021,1,Yes if/when you do the trade the existing loan will be paid off and replaced with a smaller debt.  Please make sure you shop around for rates though.  Last car loan we did was with Bank of America and I couldnt find a CU that could complete with what they offered at the time.
hmdg1ek,Bullmoose39,11/28/2021,1,What you also need to do is file a complaint with your commerce dept. and your attorney Gen. Claw backs are generally frowned upon at all even if it is paying for a uniform much less a years pay. I have never seen anything like this outside of a claim of theft.
hme09kj,usmcbrian,11/28/2021,1,It would not hold up in court. A property does not have the ability to form a contract with said utility company only an individual can. A company does not have a legal ground to stand on when trying to get an individual to incur a debt they are not obligated on.
hmdebno,Anonymoose2021,11/28/2021,1,First of allunderstand the [difference between APR and APY.](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/apr-apy-bank-hopes-cant-tell-difference/)  Banks usually quote APY.   0.1% compounded daily might mean 0.1% APR compounded daily.  At that low of an interest rate daily vs monthly doesnt make much difference.   Daily compounding turns 0.1% APR into 0.10005% APY.    Monthly compounding would be 0.0100046% just a bit lower.  Annual compounding would be the 0.1%.  It is more likely that the 0.1% is the APY and the actual APR is about 0.09995% compounded daily.  Clearly the 0.5% rate is better.
hmde54h,DirtyZiplock,11/28/2021,1,Thank you for the nice words. I have started branching out to try new things and explore what I’m interested in potentially able to do as a career.

hmdcmhy,FusSpo,11/28/2021,1,It absolutely could be 100% depending on the classification of the persons role.  EDIT: Ive always wondered why Reddit downvotes the truth.

hmeh3pq,pm-me-ur-raccoon,11/28/2021,1,You may want to up that estimate a bit. On a ~115k early distribution the federal taxes and penalties should be about $30k if you have zero other income and $40k or $50k wouldnt be surprising if you do have other income. Depending on where you live you may also have to pay state and local taxes as well.
hmdfkmq,mentat70,11/28/2021,1,If your story is correct they have to pay you back.  Maybe not that day but within a reasonable amount of time.

hmenfkn,txholdup,11/28/2021,1,Furniture salespeople are the worst they cling to you like lice when you walk into the store.  I flat out tell them if you want me to buy anything here leave me alone and I will find you.  My ex and I wanted two matching leather sofas for our den.  We went to a local furniture store and found ones we liked.  We asked for a 20% discount because we knew that furniture markup is up to 600%.  They played the manager game and said no.  We walked.  3 weeks later the same store had a buy one get one sale.  We got our matching couches for a 50% discount instead.  NEVER hesitate to walk out if they wont give you a reasonable deal. Sucking it up and buying when you know you are getting screwed will leave a bad taste in your mouth and every time you sit in that chair.
hmekms6,Ecstatic_Assumption5,11/28/2021,1,I’m based in NYC so I don’t have a car most of these jobs ask you to have one :/
hmde98l,Joe_Doblow,11/28/2021,1,What they did to me was told me there would be 0% for 12 months.  Then at some point before the 3rd month I got a letter or something saying that unlesss I paid in full by the 3rd month I would get some charge or interest hit of the whole thing that was a lot I don’t remember but they 100% baited and switched me
hmdmgcc,TRauck,11/28/2021,7,My mom wanted a warranty on the dryer she bought from Home Depot and after reading through everything I realized it was mostly nonsense. The only warranty I know of that was worth a damn is Best Buys when used with a controller keyboard or mouse.

hmddili,Kirby6365,11/28/2021,1,A single person earning 100k is not equivalent to a married couple earning 100k though. A fairer comparison would be a single person earning 50k.  For couples that earn similar incomes in many cases you actually pay more in aggregate taxes especially as you make more income.  Not to say there arent other reasons beyond finances but this is PF not relationship advice.
hmdebj3,browser1994,11/28/2021,1,Yes because all of the business credit cards I signed for with a personal guarantee. I did talk to a couple of bankruptcy lawyers and they all said that I would need to file a personal bankruptcy as just a business bankruptcy would likely be insufficient due to the personal guarantee.
hmdiey8,Pass_Little,11/28/2021,2,Thats what my spouse and I do.    I dont know if theres any other option if you want to go over $10K per year.  When the paper ones arrive well also register 50% of them in each of our accounts.
hmdstct,ScottRoberts79,11/28/2021,2,Thats because retailers are responsible for accurate pricing information. By putting it out there with a tag on it they are offering to sell it. They legally cannot go back on that price.

hme8wf5,j-christopher,11/28/2021,3,>Im not looking for relationship advice here.   I think you should reconsider this position.
hmdvoz5,keylime-avocado,11/28/2021,3,No. Btw if this is difficult to understand for you I recommend that you start learning how to calculate interest rates and returns. Basic math courses would be a good place to start and consider taking personal finance classes. That may benefit you way more than the ibonds!
hme9dhv,SonOfMcGee,11/28/2021,2,Just bought a TV at Costco. Both the person on the floor and the cashier recommended I get a warranty but it seemed like something they were just required to say.

Assuming you are not a dependent yes you are exempt for 2021. It lasts until the end of 2021. Then you should submit a new W-4 for 2022.
hmdx9tf,ajg6882,11/28/2021,5,Ive worked retail for 23 years. This happens all the time: an old tag left up wrong information on the tag etc. Stores that are worth shopping at will honor the marked price unless there is a very specific barrier for doing so. Even then theres always a higher-up that can authorize it or make it right in some way.  Many times this has happened to me as a salesman Ill have a sale where the wrong price is displayed. My usual line is We messed up - if you want it you can have it at that price as I throw the old tag in the garbage. Thankfully we use digital tags now and this hardly ever happens.  It probably wasnt dishonest but it should never have been a question to give you the marked price. That salesman absolutely lost (part of) his commission on the sale though.
hmeel0g,jurzdevil,11/28/2021,7,At Subaru the finance douche started to offer the extended warranty nonsense and i stopped him and said no i will not be purchasing extended warranty. he tried to sell it and asked if i planned to keep the car for a long time i said yes i do but is there going to be a long term issue with the car? is it not built well? warranties cover manufacturer issues are there known issues coming in the life of the vehicle? the guy stumbled then went back into the sales pitch for the different levels of warranties.   so i just sat there for 5 min as he ran through all the options. i just declined again and said im only interested in completing the necessary paperwork to complete the purchase. he then busted out a declining extended warranty form to sign. was a single page and no bullshit questions but i sat there for 5 minutes reading it before i signed just to waste his time.  form was actually ok basically name/date & VIN of car purchased saying no additional coverage purchased so i couldnt come back later and try to claim something but also if they tried to slip in a warranty in the monthly payment i had the record of declining as well.  Had the Subaru 6 years now and its been rock solid finance guy was the only negative thing but ive never met one that wasnt so not a mark against Subaru.
hmea1cl,SonOfMcGee,11/28/2021,2,Just bought a TV from Costco. All the ones they sold came with a 2-3 year warranty and the store one they pushed only extended it to 5. Kind of a weird arbitrary extension.   Though they weren’t too pushy when we declined.

hmejb6c,disorderedmomentum,11/28/2021,1,UKPersonalFinance is better to ask this question. If you are paying tax on your contributions it is an error. However some schemes are set up so that tax relief is added after the contribution is made. Check if this is the case with your pension provider. If not speak to payroll at your work and explain that you should not be paying tax on this contribution. Firms do get this wrong as happened to me they were able to rectify it.

hmdqk1l,Ritchie_not_Richie,11/28/2021,9,If you’ve been comfortable doing 90/10 keep doing it. You’re only going to hit that million that much quicker.   However the annual contribution limit for a Roth IRA is $6000 which is $500 a month. So if you needed/wanted to you could only do a Roth and bring your investing down to just under 50% of your monthly income. You’d still be miles ahead of most people.

hmek1us,JoeClackin,11/28/2021,1,Chase has a far superior app and website if this is important to you then reconsider switching.    Why do you want to leave Chase? Just because of a Nerd Wallet rating?
hme5qvt,rnelsonee,11/28/2021,9,I  think youre too  caught on up terms: it doesnt matter what you call it. Your partner wants you to pay $X/month to live there. If paying $X/month to live there is worth it to you then move in. If not then dont.  Neither you nor your partner know if youd be paying someones mortgage if you rent: if you rent a house from someone who has a mortgage on that property then sure some of your rent goes to a mortgage. But if you rent an apartment from a company who already owns the building your rent doesnt go to a mortgage. But who cares?  Where some of your rent would go in this hypothetical situation has no bearing on your decision now.  Now if you want something more fair note of course if you pay 50% of everything you should get 50% of the equity gained during your time there and its my guess hes not offering that. But on the flip side of the coin rent is more expensive than a comparable mortgage because of the flexibility - you have the option to walk out. So that comes at some cost.
hme7rs5,sifl1202,11/28/2021,3,for a lot of people the time spent to take a trip to an electronics store plus the headphones breaking and being temporarily unusable isnt even worth $12 (actually $8 after the cost of the warranty)
hmej5wn,Elk_safe,11/28/2021,1,What made you say this?
hmec7bv,someoldbikeguy,11/28/2021,1,The freezing point of water is unchanged until you reach 1/100th the atmospheric pressure at sea level so for all intents and purposes the freezing point of water is not affected by altitude as theres no place on earth with that low of a pressure.  However the boiling point is reduced by .9 degrees F for every 500 feet in elevation above sea level.

hmdxmw8,TinCanSailor987,11/28/2021,3,Her disability rating won’t change hence her payout won’t change. To make her feel better she should contact her state’s VA rep to verify this.
hmdi1aq,thunfremlinc,11/28/2021,-6,Sounds like a shite physician. That should all be readily apparent in any patient system they have.  Just last week my doctor had no problem asking me about which procedures I was okay with doing as insurance didn’t cover some or would only cover older methods. Simple as can be.
hmedi0m,BouncyEgg,11/28/2021,4,Your plan is fine.  Its basically following the PF Wiki Prime Directive Flow Chart.  1% into your company stock is also fine.  At 1% whether or not you do it will have trivial effects on your overall financial state.
hmedizx,joeshmo39,11/28/2021,2,Agree on maxing 401k. Roth is great but at OPs marginal tax rates its less appealing.
hmehrxh,brooksms,11/28/2021,1,I recently ordered a custom couch. My sales person gave general price range based on the models I thought could work. Fabric choice apparently has a big impact on the final cost though. With my selection the quote was $700 more then I anticipated which was already $1000 higher because I shifted to a nicer brand. When I hesitated and told her it surpassed the range I’d initially considered she went back to see if there was anything they could do. Instant money off the price. I really hated that part because now I won’t be able to trust her when I want more furniture. Why can’t the prices just be what they are?
hmdkclc,YoureInGoodHands,11/28/2021,39,Just be careful what you ask for.  There is a (very) small chance it will scare them off and a much larger chance they will start corresponding with your lawyer costing them $0 and you $400/hour.

hmea5a3,thunfremlinc,11/28/2021,1,> criticizing docs for not being insurance experts.  They don’t need to be. They just have to read a screen. Their patient software will say exactly what’s covered and what isn’t.  Your doctor would be one hell of a retard if they couldn’t understand that.
hmdsvaf,kent_ankerous,11/28/2021,8,Talk to your landlord. They would way rather have late rent than go through the pain of finding a new tenant
hmdfrd0,ScaryPrince,11/28/2021,1,10 years was probably an overstatement. I think 5 years unless I don’t get pay raises I’ve gotten every year for the last 20 years I’ve been a nurse.  I also plan on renting a room.  But I’ve had renters before they don’t stay forever and sometimes it takes a few months to find the right person. I don’t want to count on that income or overtime. I’ve always been able to get OT but I’ve never counted on it.  Between pay raises renting and OT I will have extra cash.  But I’m getting older and don’t want to work as much OT housemates are a mixed blessing and while my pay raises have been regular I only have a contract in hand for another 2 years. After that I need a crystal ball.
hmdenj8,ckayfish,11/28/2021,1,Why is this even a discussion? I read your post couple times and you don’t even suggest that they are specifying a reason. I wouldn’t even bother responding to them until I receive something more substantial.
hme2rx7,Algaean,11/28/2021,18,With a wife and kids you dont have to worry about what to do with all your extra money! )
hmdfh9r,latentpotential,11/28/2021,1,The various deduction caps are a bigger deal than the brackets themselves.  SALT cap? 10k for an individual and 10k for a married couple (so 5k per married person).  Mortgage interest deduction? Up to a 750k loan per individual and also up to a 750k loan for a married couple. An unmarried couple can co-own a house with a 1.5M mortgage and deduct all the interest but the year they get married their mortgage interest deduction will get halved.  This translates to a particularly large marriage penalty for dual high income married couples in high tax states with large mortgages.
hme7bf6,93195,11/28/2021,1,I agree that housing cost is probably the single biggest factor but other costs can also be too large to ignore.  Car insurance costs vary wildly by location.  In big cities parking is seldom included in rent and can add hundreds a month.  Gas costs vary widely.  $5/gal in California cities vs $3 in “Rustbelt”.  If you’re only calculating based on rent you’re missing a lot.
hme71vx,readwiteandblu,11/28/2021,1,Since you brought up cars (Fargo scene) Ill tell you my story. In early 2007 I bought a 2003 Acura from a dealer for half what a new one cost. It had 50k miles on it and was out of warranty. I bought an extended warranty for about $2000 which basically gave me a same as new deal. This wasnt CPO btw as I was buying from a Honda dealership.  The warranty was close to having run out when I felt a very small surge and took it in to be looked at in an abundance of caution. Turned out I needed a new transmission.   I found my policy and when I told the Acura dealer the policy was from Zurich they said they were absolutely the best and I would have no problems. Three days later my car was fixed and Zurich paid everything including my rental of a current model Acura same model all with no copay deductible or any other cash out of my pocket. I would 100% use them again.
hmeg579,Curious_Tony,11/28/2021,1,It’s a 2017 Honda Civic ex-t with 31000 miles in perfect shape. I know I could get more than 14k for it but I think I want to keep it as I know it will last forever.
hmecpvh,TheQuaeritur,11/28/2021,0,Actually you should pay what you would pay if you two moved in together in a rental so at most 50% of rent for a 1 BR apartment + utilities.
hmei4ue,Fly__Eagles__Fly,11/28/2021,1,I did something like this when I was in high school. Found it later in my 30s and my small amount of money had 10x’d :). Hope you get a nice find
hmdq2c3,EmberOnTheSea,11/28/2021,3,Suck it up and finish the degree and get a better paying job.  Most of us who work with people dont like people.  It is the price you pay to have a reasonable standard of living.
hmekqu1,Answerstaxquestions,11/28/2021,1,Interest will be calculated every day (I.e. 1/365 of your annual rate) and you’ll pay it every month.  So hypothetically if you paid off the loan after one month you’d pay one months interest.
hmdvcvr,RandomPlayerJoined,11/28/2021,3,You said it yourself you’re 19 and don’t understand.  Do you have to pay rent? Vehicle expenses? Food? Electric bill? Water bill? Phone/internet bill? Do you have a kid? Medical bills? How has covid affected your income? Bills don’t care.  You have two secured credit cards with $1500 each.  Let’s say your car needs a new transmission that’s $1800 alone. One of your cards doesn’t cover the cost and is now maxed out. It’s $300 for the install your at $2100. Shop has to wait for it to arrive three weeks later. So you have no car because you never opted for it on the insurance.   Let’s say it costs you $100 a week to get to and from work via ride share. You’re at $2500 of $3k. Car is still in the shop and you still have to make payments on it including insurance and all other bills let’s say $600. You’re now at $3100 and I’m debt by $100.   Now here comes the overdraft fee and monthly bill which charges you based on amount owed. You’re now at $4k in credit card bills.   But wait there’s more.  COVID! Nobody works for 4 months and you can’t pay bills credit card company doesn’t care. Your getting charged interest on the interest.  Get it now?
hme9iet,Hermit5427,11/28/2021,1,Thanks for the suggestion!
hmdut0c,MINIMAN10001,11/28/2021,1,Taking initiative to do a price override especially when doing it yourself is an uncomfortable position to be in because you dont know if you have the authority to do so or if someone will get mad at you and pull you aside later. You may also feel uncomfortable bothering someone else in order to see how you should handle this situation. Chances are he wanted you to pay and leave and not have to face any of his discomforts with the situation.  In my personal experience the business itself is the one that takes the hit and not any parties involved.
hmdegdz,Serious-Speaker4668,11/28/2021,1,How’s your health? If you aren’t working out at a gym please post your current workout schedule. You need to be exercising in some way shape or form. The more frequently the better. In 5 10 50 years you will regret the investment in your well being. Stop worrying about $360/yr and go lift. Or buy $360 of equipment a year for home gym. Either way don’t be lazy. Stop reading and get your pump on. ASAP!
hme828j,mechapoitier,11/28/2021,19,Wow that’s insulting
hmdu1gd,throwaway-wtfloans,11/28/2021,1,Thank you thank you so much!  In between the time that you made that post and this one I was able to learn more about soft inquiries and how to request a Consumer Inquiry which answered all of my questions!  I didnt know that soft inquiries were even a thing.  As far as for what the lending was for I can unfortunately let you know that some were benign and the others were.. not.  The first one was not as well.  In any case you had no reason to share your knowledge with me other than to help someone out.  Im quite grateful.  Small stuff helps.
hmdom8d,Mr_Economical,11/28/2021,0,If you secured a loan for the house the lender would require title insurance.  The title/escrow company would have paid any outstanding utility bills to insure the property would be free and clear.  IMO follow up with your title/escrow company or check your closing statement and verify if utilities were paid.
hmeeb8v,EducationalCarrot192,11/28/2021,1,Okay didnt realize that. Good to know thank you!
hme9r0j,Sirwired,11/28/2021,2,Most cars cost more than the maximum you can buy a money order for.
hme1pto,heelstoo,11/28/2021,2,Agreed. I’ve done this several times and have been completely happy with it.
hmentsf,No7onelikeyou,11/28/2021,1,Maybe I’m not understanding fully but I have a negative balance all the time. Then whenever I buy something next it just gets deducted

hmdea25,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,1,It was simply a W2 job with voluntary resignation from either party no strings attached. Honestly I am thinking that her old team is pissed at her for leaving so they are just trying to get back and harm her. Her previous manager was a senior VP with lots of influence so that may be it
hme0r2l,I_Bin_Painting,11/28/2021,3,Yeah if anything if they keep sending faulty parts it should be cause to replace the whole sofa as defective.
hmdk81j,SwoleSupplier,11/28/2021,0,Echos aren’t done at pcp appointments. He would have had to go home and scheduled it at some other time. Plenty of time to read up on his insurance.
hmdvzha,x_driven_x,11/28/2021,1,That is a progressive interest rate kind of like progressive tax brackets. The APR is what you’re going to want to look at which gives you the annual rate for the full amount.   The ignite one is the better of the two by far.   None of these rates are particularly good but no savings accounts are these days….   It’s good to get established with a credit union though for when you later want car and home loans.  Spend some time researching investing in broad diversified mutual funds and ETFs for eventual better returns on average.
hmdyy31,ajg6882,11/28/2021,1,Youd be surprised at how many times I (as a manager now) have to step in and write a sale myself so the volume doesnt disappear. For the salesman its empty volume. For the store (almost) all volume is good volume.
hmdi2df,computershateme77,11/28/2021,1,That is all I have. I decided to do a three portfolio stock that consisted of    FZROX FTIHX and FZIPX since it was consider a beginner friendly investment for ROTHs. But they have returned such small amounts that it doesnt even seem worth it.
hme5egd,93195,11/28/2021,2,A 2012 Hyundai isn’t going to last forever and a roof box isn’t that convenient for everyday use and getting kid stuff in and out.  But you don’t have to spend 40K euro on a new Peugeot either at least if you don’t have high income.  What’s your income?  If it’s modest get a bigger newer car that better suits your current needs but not a 40K Peugeot either.
hmdsen5,CQME,11/28/2021,1,> The issue is his mortgage will definitely be categorized under a jumbo loan which definitely have stricter terms to qualify and usually also means you’ll pay higher interest rate.  Yes is why Im assuming 4% when rates are lower.  Just double-checking do the numbers look about right to you?  >Most lenders will not account for this as income as it’s never guaranteed you make it to the tenured date where you receive payout.  My understanding is that its realized as income when vested but I could be wrong here and have no experience with these kind of options.
hmdukd3,never_reddit_sober,11/28/2021,8,Im getting starter home vibes with a twist. A home is a home first investment second. Does the duplex meet your needs better than current rental? Would it accelerate your plans to purchase a different home or slow you down? Gotta run the numbers factor in costs. Being a one property landlord isnt super profitable right away unless you get the place for a steal.     Making it by buying a home is a fucking myth. Rent max out your retirement accounts and have a taxable brokerage. When you are sick of SF buy a house somewhere else with your liquidated assets.     If youre that desperate to own a home now I say move.
hme0q0o,Arashi3xx,11/28/2021,1,Thank you will start reading. Do you happen to know any ideas on the top of your head though that maybe arent mentioned in this page?
hmdhqj8,DogKnowsBest,11/28/2021,42,Im not an HR professional but Ive been in the corporate world working both tech and tech sales positions for 35 years. I know what a base salary is and it has absolutely zero to do with commission or a draw against commission.  What you might be referring to is called clawback a potential contract provision that is typically reserved for executive level employees who may leave the company and go to a competitor.  Individual state laws may exclude or limit the amount of take back an employer can take.  However for a clawback to be enforceable it MUST be in the employer/employee contract.  /u/JayceThompson101 has stated that reading through his wifes contract there was no such provision and thus the employer has no rights whatsoever to require the employee to payback monies earned.  And if this scenario holds true OPs wife is fully lawfully protected.
hmddj1m,uptimefordays,11/28/2021,1,Real furniture is expensive a lot of people dont pay for it all at once as a result.
hme9rcq,hijinks,11/28/2021,2,Depends. You are a common share holder. For example if the VCs want 4x their return on investment.   If the company was bought for $200mil with $50mil invested then the VCs will take all the money and you get $0  It could also be a stock swap so your shares are converted into the buying companies stock you could sell on the market.

hmdxcdi,saltycod,11/28/2021,8,HDHP almost always ends up cheaper. For a PPO to be better than an HDHP you have to be in the sweet spot of healthcare between virtually no care needed and a lot of care needed. Very people exist in this region. People just dont like HDHPs because they cost money now. But theyre almost always the best option.
hmeateo,gitsgrl,11/28/2021,1,As for an itemized statement of your account from the derm.
hmdt31l,zacce,11/28/2021,1,1. Offering $15500 cash is not a hardass given the 3 website estimates.   2. I used this strategy in my recent (new) car purchase. Worked in 1 dealer out of 15. I got laughed at in several dealerships but didnt bother me after 2-3 visits.

hmdquq9,wattatime,11/28/2021,8,Happened to me at micro center too. Bought some memory but it rang up at a new higher price. I said the sticker has a cheaper price and they honored it. Great customer service.
hmengyu,nogain-allpain,11/28/2021,1,My guess if it was an actual Nike purchase is that your email address was randomly used in order to cover the tracks of a fraudster. They used a mailing address that isnt traceable to them (maybe a neighbor?) and picked a random but real email address (yours) from all of the public lists of email addresses out there. When the gift cards get mailed to that address they go pick it up and walk away without a trace.
hmekkh3,Elk_safe,11/28/2021,1,It is amicable? He co-wrote this post with me?  I really dont understand the point of this if youre not going to be constructive. This is an advice forum.
hmdiie2,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,4,I believe my plan will be to ask for the reason and give a deadline for them to respond.
hmdfmju,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,1,This is most likely my plan here man will ignore until they take further action. Will record all communications too incase we need to present our case to a lawyer.
hmdk2uc,zamundan,11/28/2021,41,Did they pay any relocation fees for you?  A lot of Fortune 500 companies will pay fees associated with selling your home buying a new one moving your stuff storing your stuff temporary housing etc.  Could easily add up to that amount.
hmdx688,shipwreck17,11/28/2021,1,Exactly. You need history and the right bank.  I was self employed for my first mortgage and most banks needed 3 years of tax returns. My mortgage broker found a local credit union that only required 2. I had 3 years but the first one had very little profit from a new business.
hmdh0ps,TRauck,11/28/2021,5,Is this an actual thing? Companies have you sign a contract that basically says if you dont work here x amount of time then you must pay us back all the money payed at an hourly rate?
hmdqe47,entotheenth,11/28/2021,1,SIL chose a nice comfortable leather recliner couch and chairs was about $4500 Australian. They delivered one but it took over a month and she swears it’s not the one she ordered it’s uncomfortable and just seems slightly different from what they had on the floor. Problem is they no longer sold that model and she couldn’t prove t wasn’t what she ordered. Furniture places suck.
hmedizc,j-christopher,11/28/2021,1,>Using three of the best known car value websites (Nada Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds) the market value of the vehicle is shown as follows: KBB: 14048 - 15919 NADA: 14650 Edmunds: 13905 - 15343  This is like using Zillows home valuation estimate to decide how much to pay for a house.  Look at comparable models on several car ad sites ([Cargurus.com](https://Cargurus.com)  [cars.com](https://cars.com) [autotrader.com](https://autotrader.com) etc.) and youll get a pretty strong idea of what the car will bring at retail.
hme71ri,Actual-Description-2,11/28/2021,1,You need to have a conversation with him to come up with a number that you believe is fair for rent and have it documented. Paying nothing doesnt seem fair unless you have some reasoning behind why you should be paying nothing - i.e. You are contributing in some other way or you had a previous agreement that hes going against.  All you seem to have given is that you dont want to contribute toward his mortgage. It is true that if you rented somewhere else youd be paying someone elses mortgage so its not really different IMO. What do rent rates for similar sized houses/apartments go for in your area? Are those rates lower than what your boyfriend (or ex boyfriend?) is suggesting you pay him? Then there you go thats your counter argument. However if the rent rates are the same as what he wants you to pay or higher I dont really see you winning that debate. Typically rent is going to be more expensive than a mortgage because a landlord is trying to guarantee the payment of their mortgage taxes etc on the property. So if saving money is the most important goal of yours then maybe continuing to live with your parents is the most affordable option to accomplish that.
hmeeb85,LongjumpingMessage36,11/28/2021,1,0.1% interest compounded per period (day) you can adjust the period to be annual by doing (1+0.1%)^365 - 1 = about 44% per year.  So if you put in $1 today in 365 days you’d have $1.44. That’s way higher than market rates so that’s either a scam or it’s an annual rate.   Interest rates are usually quoted on an annualized basis for comparability. For example a 12% rate compounded monthly is (1+1%)^12 -1 and a 12% rate compounded semiannually is (1+6%)^2 -1.
hmdyt65,Imbrokeandiveatruck,11/28/2021,1,Dude two days of door dashing and you’ll have your rent. Your 20 you have a motivation problem. It’s the 28th. You can easily get $360 in two days. Stop being lazy. Oh yea and talk to your land lord now and say. “It’s possible I might be late but I’m working my ass of to make sure it doesn’t happen.” Then keep working extra and get your self an emergency fund. So I don’t have to keep typing.
hmein2n,oledawgnew,11/28/2021,1,I would try to deploy the money as soon as possible starting with the business so as to maximize income right away before other life’s needs and wants creep up.  Before trying to trade the vehicle in I would get a sell estimate first from Carvana or one of the other car buying services they seem to offer more without a hard sales pitch to buy one of theirs as part of the deal.  As for reinvesting the $40-50k a SEP-IRA might be the best place to start. I’m a hardcore fan of Roth IRAs due to the flexibility of being able to withdraw contributions without penalty and you cannot beat the future no tax withdrawals.  Don’t know the status of your business but you probably want to put some aside for emergency funds (separate ones for the business and personal needs if you can afford it).  Good luck!
hme9ihl,Illustrious-Ease974,11/28/2021,1,At 24 had about $1200 in credit card debt.  I absolutely felt suffocated by it and wondered how people rack up so much.  Now at 30 Ive had a moment in time with $14000 in credit card debt.  We had a series of unfortunate events after buying a house and didnt have the emergency funds.  Luckily we paid most of it off in the past year.  I know people who have $50000+ in credit card debt. That still blows my mind but I havent experienced events in life they have and hope not to.  Ive had a $20000 limit since 25.
hmdix28,WizardOfIF,11/28/2021,2,Ive negotiated a lot of medical bills. Its usually easier to do before they bill your insurance but it is still possible to to do so afterwards. I find it is usually best to be honest with them (let them know you werent expecting it to be so expensive) and ask if there is anything they can do to help you out. Dont make demands and be prepared for them to say no.  If they dont offer an immediate discount at your first request sometimes if you tell them youll need a payment plan in order to pay it off theyll follow up with a discount for being able to settle the balance in full.  Ive only once had a doctors office refuse to work with me on a bill when I felt like I was being overcharged and that was the last time I visited that practice.
hmdqmq6,CQME,11/28/2021,0,By far the biggest financial benefit of marriage is a roommate you can trust to split the bills assuming of course you dont egregiously expand your expenses just because you have a bigger household and of course assuming you married someone whos trustworthy (sadly this is not always the case).  Other than that marriage is usually quite costly especially if theres only one breadwinner and especially if you have kids.  Kids are not friendly to your wallet.  Kids arent there to provide you income.  This is why the government steps in to provide tax incentives for marriage and child care because if they didnt most people would think the costs of marriage would be prohibitive.
hmed43v,Jamikest,11/28/2021,1,Plan It shows up as a separate loan not part of your credit card utilization. Source: I have used Plan It in the past.
hmdk2sb,hiagha,11/28/2021,1,Yeah it takes a lot longer to clear a check than people think. The bank will make the funds available after confirming that an account exists. They won’t know if the account has funds to cover the check for much longer often weeks longer.
hmdhyga,3s1kill,11/28/2021,1,I do this as well but not half. I usually up it 1% every year but to be honest I havent as I am trying to lay down some debt. I got a 14% raise this year so I put 1% in my Roth and 2% in my 401k.  I also invest in stocks and have made more than I lost thank goodness. So I need to add more to my 401k to offset my capital gains.  I really like the half going to 401k idea. Ill make that 2022 goal. Currently doing 6% into my 401k and my company matches up to 4%. Then I do 1% into my Roth. Also as a bonus I get 7% of my salary in a lump sum from my employer into my 401k.
hmdl9yk,Muzzy637,11/28/2021,2,It’s just how mortgage underwriting goes.   “Please explain what is this monthly payment $1200 every month to mortgage company b?”  They will simply lower the amount that you’re able to borrow because of this.

hmdobt0,WhileNotLurking,11/28/2021,7,There is no wrong there. Generally time in the market beats attempting to time the market.   This is a retirement account. You likely have many years before you will need to touch it.   Reassessment of your risk tolerance is likely in order. See how much risk you are willing to take and make sure your investments are in alignment with that.   If you are young ( under 30 ) you should be super agressive. A short dip now will be washed away after decades of growth between now and your retirement.   Remember this is for the long haul. Don’t do crazy speculating In the account. Low cost index funds are your friend.

hmdhoa4,RonStopable08,11/28/2021,48,Yeah.  Here is what I would do: record every conversation and email.  Make notes and keep an accurate timeline.  File a complaint with your att. Gen. commerce dept and state labour.  I would also write one final email asking for proof that this money is owed as well as the contact information for the legal department so your lawyer can get involved.  Also request a reply by a certain date and if there is no reply by said date the matter will be considered closed.  (By saying this you will have reasonable grounds later to say “I didn’t pay because they didn’t get back to me”)  As an added measure you can consider consulting an employment lawyer (if you do this do it before sending anything else) hell maybe you could find a free consult.

hmdrh4i,PossessionDapper609,11/28/2021,2,Only invest money that you won’t need anytime soon investing any amount as a teenager puts you far ahead but honestly if money isn’t so important to you right now then I’d personally invest the money in yourself find out what you want to do in life and what you might want to go to college for just work as many jobs as possible so you can figure out what job might be worth it college and a good paying job is better than slaving away in a factory for decent money and if you really want to invest I say just stick it in an S&P 500 fund and make sure you never sell it until retirement age I’ve lost lots of money trying to pick and choose individual stocks and not going to college so this is just my personal advice to you but enjoy your teenage years you’ll only get one chance to enjoy them

hmdgjio,goatsampson,11/28/2021,9,I got fired from my first job at 16 years old back in the early aughts because they thought I too was stealing despite it being almost every other employee who was actually robbing them blind (fortune 500 company at the time but out of business now shocker) and had lawyers call my house for months claiming I owed them money and even then I knew that they could fuck off. Never answered them I knew it was bullshit. Absolutely do not entertain this at all. Theyre groveling and begging for you/her to be stupid enough to pay them her rightful money earned. Classic hail mary tactic on their part. Just ignore the ask. I eventually asked a lawyer friend and they confirmed that this type of shit happens a lot theyre fishing for dummies to fall for the trap.
hmdidfv,Zookeeper1099,11/28/2021,0,Decent company don’t lower your pay when you take lower position. You do it because you are doing them a favor it would be disgusting to lower your pay for this.

He was a team lead in my team but switched to another team as regular member because they already had a team lead and just needed extra pair of hands.

hmdp73r,CQME,11/28/2021,2,>My fiancé and I and trying to figure what to do next. We have a little over $150k saved for a down payment on a house. We make $210k between the two of us in San Francisco and would make considerably less in another city with what we do.  Antioch and Pittsburg have (relatively) affordable housing strongly recommend looking there and commuting if at all possible.    >We currently pay $2100 a month for rent and the idea of purchasing a house/condo and taking a $4k-$5k mortgage just seems so dumb  Yup.  >Is purchasing a duplex and renting one unit really as attractive as it seems? We are fine with working on the house the landlord aspects but financially how long are you realistically looking at before you can re-finance and go buy a house to live in?  Not sure why the calculus necessarily includes a refinance.  You can lock in a very low rate now on the duplex and then save the rent proceeds for another purchase later on.  Treat the duplex like renting a room in your house except its a wholly separate unit so you dont have to worry as much about security and privacy.  >Thanks for any advice we are just lost and the housing market here everyone knows is crazy but is just crushing at times.  Yeah IMHO a lot of CA is unlivable now because of housing.  Good luck!
hmen9uo,CyberMatrix87,11/28/2021,1,Mortgage loans in the U.S.? It seems odd to have full responsibility be on the mortgage contract yet not on the title/deed.

hmdi9oc,MediumExplorer,11/28/2021,1,On the other hand I assume my salary would go up enough to afford a home eventuallly given that I started my career almost 2 years ago. Taking in $250k is very doable before my 30s. Add in a spouse and it wouldn’t be so bad.  Another idea is to leave Washington but I grew up here and it’s hard to leave home.

hmdgff2,Rojaddit,11/28/2021,70,This.  The law is not a magic shield that stops companies and people from trying illegal things out of malice or ignorance.  In fact a lot of businesses make a practice of breaking the law or asking for things they are not legally entitled to simply because they tend to get away with it often enough to be worth the occasional penalty.    Especially in the case of an employer you that is known to behave in a toxic manner - there is every reason to expect they are misbehaving and no particular reason to expect them to be particularly aware of how employment law actually works.
hmdljro,CQME,11/28/2021,1,Dont know about the RSU part.   Looking at your cash salary standard metric is debt to income around 35% is standard.  Going to spitball and say your current monthly payments are $500/month and your current cash income is around $20k/month you can probably afford easily another $7k/month in house.  This is around a $1.2mil house with a 4% mortgage tax and insurance included.  Add in your RSU income and youre probably going to comfortably afford this.  edit - hmmm...you already have a house guessing with a mortgage.  Thats important to include to figure out your current monthly obligations.  Also your cash on hand is a bit low for a purchase this size.  Probably still doable but youre likely going to have to liquidate some assets if youre comfortable with that or just save aggressively for several months.

Teslas will continue to be mass produced and will be built cheaper / better. Get the car if you want it! But dont treat it as an investment / appreciating asset   Just another thought using a historical calculator. 38k in the market in 2018 would be a total gain of 44% at the end of 2021. Compared to the 16% appreciation of the Tesla

hmdjp2d,SnooGuavas1745,11/28/2021,3,The whole system is shite. They shouldn’t have to ask anyone what insurance covers and we shouldn’t be expected to jump through such RIDICULOUS hoops to get proper care. Besides the insurance can change its mind later and pay a smaller portion “because it’s not medically necessary.”  There is a statement on most (if not all) insurance phone calls stating that everything is just a quote when providers verify your benefits. And that the insurance will determine the final cost after the claim is fully processed. So you may pay your patient responsibility at the time of service BUT you can also be hit with an additional bill later.   Sometimes I swear it just depends on which claims processor gets your claim.
hmdn99c,CQME,11/28/2021,1,>Firstly when do I search for a lender for a mortgage? Right now?  Yep now is fine first step in the homebuying process is to determine if you need a mortgage.  If you need a mortgage get pre-approved first before house hunting.  This will give you a ballpark as to how much of a house you can afford so you dont go around looking at pie-in-the-sky mansions no one will finance for you.  >how do I go about finding a lender? Do I just apply to as many places as I can and compare who gives me the best terms?  You can go on the web and research rates.  IMHO theres not much difference between lenders except for the rates they offer.  Go with prime lenders first if you have the credit for it (assuming you do)...prime lenders are basically banks.  Some online institutions have less overhead and can offer even lower rates.  Typically what a lot of institutions do is that once they fund your mortgage they immediately sell your mortgage to Wall Street so that they get the funds back to fund another mortgage rinse and repeat.  Do your research...ensure you know what a prepayment penalty is what points are what closing costs are the difference between rate and APR etc etc  i.e. the nuts and bolts of a mortgage.  >Do I just apply to as many places as I can and compare who gives me the best terms?  Yep this is called shopping around sounds like you know how it works.  =)  >Lastly I heard some banks will give .25 or .50 percent reductions on mortgages to people who have money in accounts with the bank for a few months. Could these give the best rates? It can’t be too hard to just open an account and transfer money for a few months right?  Banks might offer discounts for a myriad number of reasons.  Just shop around.

hmebrou,NewAltProfAccount,11/28/2021,2,They just gave me one for free on Black Friday for a tv. The real trick at Costco is that if it goes on sale in the next 30 days you can get the difference between what you payed and the new price back. If you are able to anticipate a price change you can buy when in stock and adjust when it changes.
hmdhb88,thunfremlinc,11/28/2021,3,Not at all it’s “I’m pissed that my doctor did a procedure without letting me know that this is no longer preventative and is now diagnostic”.   Even if OP fully understood their insurance they’d still be bitten by this practice. We’re not doctors. We don’t know which procedure falls into what category.
hmdge4q,nn123654,11/28/2021,2,Specifically I find it helpful to think ignoring everything else what would I rather invest in today this stock or another one?  If theres a clear preference/answer then I sell if not then I stay with what I have. Its worked well for me so far. The losses should be irrelevant to your decision the only thing that matters if whether you think it will outperform in the future and its always a good idea to hedge your bets.

hmdh9tf,imedicflagstaff,11/28/2021,12,The answer is no. The market just had a big dip and there could potentially be more. Just keep investing and forget about it. If you keep investing you will get dollar cost averaging (look this up).
hmeimrt,Fish-Weekly,11/28/2021,1,You have 60 days to roll over all or a portion of it to an IRA without paying penalties on that portion. Any amount you’ve already paid would get refunded to you when you file your taxes. If you’ve got a good tax person already ask them to help you.  I know it is tempting to tap that money when there are bills to pay but the more you can keep invested and tex deferred the better you will be later in life.
hmdmma4,TheNovac,11/28/2021,1,To figure out the problem: Log into his health insurance portal and/or call the insurance company and request the EOB (Explanation of Benefits) for the claim. This will typically include an explanation as to why the claim was denied (prior authorization required lack of information etc.) You can use this information to address the denial reason and begin an appeal.  *Possibilities: Since he didnt receive surgery his insurance didnt recognize the event as an emergency requiring him to be admitted to the hospital. Most if not all plans require prior authorization for certain higher-cost treatments. This is usually waived for a short time period when admitted to a hospital for an emergency however you need to contact your insurance company to notify them of the emergency usually within 48 hours. Sometimes if youre at an out-of-network hospital you may need to be moved to a different hospital or receive additional authorization. If they werent notified they might have viewed it as a failure to obtain authorization.*

hmdrbak,maartenvanheek,11/28/2021,9,Maybe its because its already in stock so they paid the lower wholesale price for it to begin with. But nice that there honoured it!
hmdttwg,islangmemes,11/28/2021,2,So a few things to note here OP. The car market right now is insane and it’s 100% a sellers market. Dealerships are pricing cars way above market value because they can…. And why would they drop the price and negotiate with you when someone else would be willing to pay the inflated price? Unfortunately that’s the situation we’re in. I was helping my girlfriend find a new car and it’s a fucking mad house out there right now. Everything that was remotely decent price was being bought sight unseen. A listing would go up and the car would be gone by the time she got there. The only other cars left to be grabbed were over priced or not good quality.   All I can recommend is have great patience. It’s going to be frustrating but don’t settle.  Eventually you will find something that is a fair deal.
hme40py,Meghanshadow,11/28/2021,1,Are your staff paid a great hourly base rate or is their income based on commission where they’re rewarded for selling more expensive things?  Had a friend at a car dealer who wouldn’t even talk to low tier customers because he needed those luxury sales to pay his rent so any time “wasted” on other customers hurt his personal income.
hmdlfn2,-1KingKRool-,11/28/2021,2,In theory you should be able to look up the bank and call them to verify the check exists.  But yeah my personal tolerances would demand doing the exchange at the bank and witnessing the creation of it.
hmdd7ox,uptimefordays,11/28/2021,1,With furniture especially things like reclining couches you may need them tightened up or serviced after 10 or 15 years. I dont know that Id buy a warranty for that but its not inconceivable one might need to pay a furniture repair person at some point or another.

hmedfgv,jerryeight,11/28/2021,1,Yeah absolutely depends on everyones specific plans.   If you already have a lot of money and real estate and cars then definitely maximize those 0% loans. Put that money into index funds and maybe some potentially lucrative stocks/options. 2 months before the promo ends sell enough to payoff the loans and capital gains taxes and let the rest ride. 😀
hmdz1kc,DeluxeXL,11/28/2021,1,First you need to convert 8% APY to interest rate. If you do monthly compounding 8% APY is 7.72% APR. With no other fees 7.72% APR is 7.72% interest rate.

hme1me2,heelstoo,11/28/2021,1,This is exactly why I take pictures of everything when I buy something expensive- the item in the store it’s tags it’s model numbers and any other information related to it. If possible I also try to research the specific item before I buy it so I find the one I want in-store take my pictures and go home to see if I can find a better price reviews etc.   My spouse *hates* car shopping because of all of the pressures that the salespersons put on people but I love it. I come in informed and prepared- know their stock (from online) know what I’m willing to pay and am willing to walk.

hmdn3uo,skynetempire,11/28/2021,2,401k/pension you can put anyone. Marriage forces the spouse to be on there. Health insurance allow for domestic partnership. Same for HSA.

hmdpqh0,Pass_Little,11/28/2021,5,The bond interest rate is annual.  So if you invest $10K multiply it by 0.0712 you get $712 per YEAR not month.  Plus that 7.12 is variable and is the highest its ever been.   Its basically indexed to inflation.   So you may find that 6 months from now its lower or higher than the 7.12%

hmdkg1l,1nd3x,11/28/2021,0,>you cant typically get cash back on a purchase of a home.  you tell the buyer that you want a cashback clause in the purchase agreement and then you offer them whatever youre agreed price is + how much cashback you want.  This does increase closing costs with your realtors slightly but its rather negligible...  very similar to if you were to agree to buy the home and then on your final walkthrough you could be like hey...noticed you punched a hole in the drywall...to close the deal give me $500 cashback so I can fix it and so that we dont have to fuck around with drawing up a complete new contract  and you do that. I know you can do it because I did it on my home when the inspection noted an outward facing door was damaged.  and I also know you can tell your mortgage lender that youre going to roll some credit card debt into the mortgage because I also did that and I also took another $10000 to go on a Vacation as well.  And that $10k vacation cost me 2.97% interest while I paid it off. Instead of the 20% a credit card or 4.5% that my LoC had at the time. But...the important thing was that whatever I would have put against the vacation when it was on a credit card when against the mortgage above and beyond my regular mortgage payments. I actually threw an additional $1000/month on my mortgage so 10months later my Vacation was off my mortgage  Your mortgage is backed by the value of your home....but your home will likely go up in value so provided you dont have absolutely abhorrent credit (and considering your credit card is probably linked to your bank so once again...it all falls within your total debt service ratio) your bank will probably be okay with risking your credit card debt being put on top of your home.  Yes you run the risk of paying more interest on that loan provided you dont follow the very specific steps I wrote about but thats why i took the time to write out the details of what you have to do.

hmeex9x,Djinn42,11/28/2021,1,>I don’t know how much the house will cost?  You will be looking for a house in a specific range because you should figure out what monthly mortgage payment fits your budget.  You want to get preapproved for the top of that range. The preapproval says this is the most money we will lend you not this is the exact amount we will lend you.
hmdlrl0,Pemi1099,11/28/2021,1,I understand where you are coming from. Im not arguing that youre wrong I am just arguing that this situation is pretty rare. For every 1 that ends up in court there is probably 99 that have it be an uneventful situation where they eventually either get married or they split and nothing comes of it. And in your friends case that you mentioned you cant be certain the agreement keeps it out of court. He very well may still go to court and still have to pay a lawyer $5k for the same result.   You could say the same about dashcams for drivers. Dashcams have bailed out a lot of people from insurance fraud and other people bending the truth in an accident but that doesnt mean I would call it a piece of essential equipment for operating a vehicle.   I think the bigger consideration is who youre with. How long have you been together? Have you had a discussion about the long term future and are on the same page? Have you lived with this person before? Do you have any signs that they are a litigious or vindictive individual? Etc. Not that this is fool proof but Id feel much better doing this with someone I had dated for 6 years had discussed wanting to get married had lived together with and that I trusted vs someone Id been with for a year and a half and never lived with.

hme62wo,93195,11/28/2021,0,If she didn’t have a high disability rating yes your income would eliminate VA benefits.  I’m a veteran (not disabled) and  am not eligible for much because I make too much money.  I’m pretty sure the disability rating trumps that though.  But she should call the VA to be sure.
hmddtnd,fenton7,11/28/2021,1,Sounds like there is an employment contract which you indicated is boilerplate. What does it say? If the duration of the contract was for a year and she resigned before then then the company may have the right to claw back her salary. Employment contracts go both ways. Gives the employee protection from layoff but also the firm protection from unexpected resignations.
hmdej2y,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,1,That could be it. The company is very unorganized and unprofessional in every aspect.

hme5h6w,wirexyz,11/28/2021,26,Rent anywhere is paying someone elses mortgage.   What is your point? You want a stake in the house or you want to stay for free?
hmdcocf,PetraLoseIt,11/28/2021,1,> I am worried that the sticker shock she gets will discourage her.  I was thinking about this too. In the end you almost always will have made extra money on her doing this (the exception would be if through her income youd fall out of a certain beneficial program that gave you more than what she earned-after-taxes).   But it might be good to look at the total effect of her doing this on your lives.  Youd first have to calculate how much she really earned: revenu minus costs minus income tax. Then look at the work she has to do for that income Id both look at hours worked and at how much fun the work was and will be. Going forward some of that work should also be a good solid administration of costs and earnings (date spent/received item(s) bought/sold or services received *and* storing the proof like bank statements for multiple years). Maybe thats more boring to her than the trading but it doesnt have to take long. So given all that your wife should be able to decide whether she wants to continu doing this and if so whether on the same scale or perhaps a bit less (or more?).  Something else: to reduce the tax burden (also still for 2021) your wife could decide to put some of her earned money into a traditional IRA. Or she could decide to reduce her *future* tax burden by putting money in a Roth IRA. Read more on retirement accounts [in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=personalfinance&utm_content=t5_2qstm#wiki_retirement_accounts). If at some point this becomes a true little company she can also look into opening a self-employed retirement account in which one can put even more per year in a tax friendly way.

This is a very expensive life lesson.  >but am I slowing down my personal growth by continuing to live at home?   No.  You are slowing down your personal growth because you dropped out of your career choice and incurred $55k in debt doing so.  You dont have a degree you can use and you dont have prospects to earn more in the work force.  Strongly suggest you reconsider whatever it is you want to do with a degree and get this fixed.  Ensure whatever you get a degree in is marketable and is something that wont incur more pointless debt in the process.

hmdje5i,sfdude2222,11/28/2021,118,I had a situation kind of like this about a decade ago. I got fired from a job (best thing to ever happen to me) and the sent me another paycheck after I left. They did something kind of funky where they paid current basically they were two weeks ahead I never really understood it. Anyway I did not expect to receive another paycheck from them but I did. When I got it I wasnt sure what to make of it due to their fuckery. I was contacted by them and they wanted me to pay the gross back to them I told them I would pay the net which was unacceptable. This was 100% their error. They paid payroll taxes which they wanted me to pay back. They paid insurance premiums which they be told me did not extend my coverage. The company I worked for was the insurance company that got paid the premiums. I basically told them to kick rocks and they told me it would go to collections. I never heard anything for three years and then I was called by a collection agency. I told them to send me a debt validation letter and I never heard from them again. My credit is perfect and nothing ever hit my score.   So yeah tell them to fuck off. Cut off my all contact. Unless you got it in a certified letter it never happened.

hmdhx6h,Starbuck_trustno1,11/28/2021,1,That is not a lot at all and will considerably affect your settlement. For reference Im an auto claims adjuster so I do this for a living.   They will likey argue that your fibromyalgia diagnosis came so far after the accident that it isnt related.   I went thru your post history because I was curious. Unless your attorney filed a lawsuit you get nothing because the 3 year statute of limitations has passed.   If he did file a lawsuit and protect the statute Id ask for $150k and be happy to settle for 40k cause it doesnt sound like you have a very strong case unfortunately.
hmdq3pw,theberkshire,11/28/2021,1,Yes and generally speaking going forward never pay any medical bill the first time it gets sent to you. Or even the second or maybe third. In fact a lot of people mistake bills for statements that literally say This is not a bill on them because it might look like one.   Depending on their billing department and your insurance companys response time it could take several months till they figure out what you actually owe. I automatically toss the first two bills as a matter of practice then go from there.
hmdj1vx,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,64,Man I truly appreciate the great advice thank you so much for this! Will be following these steps
hmdv576,Invest2prosper,11/28/2021,0,GP is doing EKG to boost their annual gross income per patient.  Sorry if it sounds like bordering on unethical behavior.  I’ve had it done twice and each time referred to a specialist who said I kid you not - “what are you doing here” ran all the tests and said there is absolutely nothing wrong with your heart.  Eat healthy exercise and reduce stress.  Enjoy the rest of your life.  Says a lot of these GPs are basically running EKGs to CYA (other symptoms can screen for fainting - bad reaction to medication anxiety low blood sugar etc.) or boost annual billing at $250 a pop whereas an annual physical runs $165.  Do the math.
hmdivxm,areyouamish,11/28/2021,1,Theres a difference between being frugal and being a miser (Ebenezer Scrooge). No amount of savings are worth a life lived miserably. Spend where it improves your quality of life and dont feel bad about it.

hme8fbw,WCCobra,11/28/2021,5,He made the decision to purchase the property so one would hope he is able to afford the monthly bills on his own. However if you both reside in the same household then you both should contribute towards the monthly expenses. The question is how much to contribute?  Look at the cost of apartments throughout the area that you would be willing to live in. Take their monthly rent and add on estimated utility costs. Compare this price to what your boyfriend is expecting you to pay. If living with your boyfriend is more affordable then it should be a very easy decision for you to make.  If living elsewhere is cheaper then I would sit down and talk to him about what you can afford. He may agree on you paying the lower amount instead. Alternatively you may be able to convince him to allow you to pay the full cost of specific bills instead. If you both cannot come to an agreement then you must do what is financially best for you ...
hmdgobo,dequeued,11/28/2021,4,Theyre *very* similar with a few minor differences. The main one that is a positive thing is that some 403(b) plans allow some people with 15+ years of service at the company/organization to contribute up to $3000 extra per year (its a separate thing from the more well-known age 50+ catch-up contributions for 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans).

hmdvej3,Invest2prosper,11/28/2021,7,Find a new GP.  If the GP has an echo machine in the office that doesn’t require a pre authorization from insurance company in advance then it sounds like you went to a one stop shop set up to maximize annual billing.  You need a specialized technician to run that test and it usually costs $1800 or so with insurance.  Not sure how they ran that test for such a low price.  And who was the cardiologist who read the results or is the GP acting as a cardiologist too?

You aren’t paying 32% in taxes on your full salary. You’re missing tens of thousands somewhere.

hmdenxk,buttoncode,11/28/2021,1,Look up debt validation letter. Send one certified mail with tracking and it gives them 30 days to provide proof it was yours.

hmei9j1,HighOnGoofballs,11/28/2021,1,If you can put the total original amount into an IRA they will then either cut you a check or the IRS will give it back to you.
hmdeitz,Dr_thri11,11/28/2021,1,Meh I still have a couch I paid $29 for used 10 yrs ago.  Its a basement couch now but furniture is only expensive if you insist on buying higher end stuff.
hmej9lt,Michaeldavid198,11/28/2021,1,Thanks for that information! I didn’t know that’s what some of them do. Thankfully I only have a car loan with them but I can understand some risks may be involved. Regardless if I chose to finance with them do you think they’d allow me to make this change based off the information I provided? Thanks!
hmen4vk,YeetingSlamage,11/28/2021,1,I am a younger person i have a credit history but not much of one i tried to apply for a credit card in person and was denied.
hmecrst,DoomBuggE,11/28/2021,2,More like my employer is. The cost difference of my plan vs my employer’s HSA plan is $6/month for family coverage. I’m OK paying $72/year to not worry about a deductible.  Even if I was purchasing my own plan the cost difference would be $2400/year for my family of 3. Yet I would then have an individual deductible of $7K and a family deductible of $14K.  Looking back on the last 3 years of health expenses my daughter would have hit her deductible this year. My husband and daughter would have each hit their deductible last year and I would have hit mine in 2019. My pregnancy and delivery in 2019 was planned but everything else was not.  If I was on the HDHP I would have spent $28000 in deductibles in 3 years. If I had invested the premium difference in an HSA I’d still be coming out quite behind with the HDHP.
hme7byw,Csherman92,11/28/2021,1,That’s not true. Most things denied by insurance are not because the insurance refuses to pay it’s because it is coded wrong.   Things get coded wrong all the time and get resubmitted the right way to be covered. Most insurance companies will fix the error.

hmdbw4a,AndrewIsOnline,11/28/2021,1,Why even do that?  Just ignore them.  What are they going to do?  Wait for them to spend money on a lawyer to come after you before you lift a finger in my opinion.  You have the contract.   The moneys in your bank account.   They are obviously waiting on you to wire it.  You have all the power.
hmddc8v,dirtydownstairs,11/28/2021,1,thats a lot of money Id talk to a lawyer now to be safe. Might be a waste of money but if its not... well thats a lot of money!
hmddkjh,impressive_specimen,11/28/2021,1,Work recently made a change where if youre using direct deposit you have to sign up to a third party website in order to view the information that is on the pay stubs like PTO hours and the like. Beyond tired of having to make accounts like this. So going with physical checks now to get the physical stub. Thats why it has to be local.
hme6k9p,Witty_Instance_8336,11/28/2021,1,It’s the general feeling that a significant portion of my assets are “not liquid” until I am 59.5 years old. I do have an emergency fund and taxable savings.
hmddxac,Crazy_Opposite_7783,11/28/2021,1,What was the most an index fund dropped before the 59% record? )
hmdczwt,Critical-Cell-3064,11/28/2021,1,Chase has a deal right now that they will give you $225 if you set up direct deposit of $500 or more a month. I used to use Wells Fargo and switched to chase.   And then I transfer money to and from my Marcus online HYSA. Since I referred my wife we are both getting 1% APY for the next 3 months. I used to keep my money in the Wells Fargo savings account which had an APY of 0.01%. So it’s a big difference.   I have heard that sometimes local credit unions can give a high APY. Like 0.5% or more. That will depend on the credit union and the area. Look around.   There are also other well known online bank companies with HYSA like American Express (0.4%) and capital one (0.4%).  I also saw a newer online bank called “one” and they have 1.0% APY. Which sounds good and is FDIC insured like the other ones but I chose the Marcus one over that one since Marcus is more well known and I didn’t want to go with a newer company.
hmdf2he,Arashi3xx,11/28/2021,1,Thats true people say to start high
hmejw3i,mikasjoman,11/28/2021,1,This is kind of typical. Someone starts a business just to try to sell some stuff. But as it takes off they forget to open a company and more important that the law is quite strict on the you have to do the weekly accounting or pay fines/go to jail part.   Get pro help with an accountant. Its gonna save you a lot of headache and it sounds like shes gonna need one going ahead anyways given that shell continue her business..

hme6vow,Witty_Instance_8336,11/28/2021,1,Super helpful response— thank you.  Only things I’m not doing are backdoor Roth and HSA.
hmdr2qd,Ezzabee,11/28/2021,5,Yes I have done these numbers every year for all my younger coworkers. The HDHP for a high-earned makes way more sense especially if they put the max OOP into the HSA.
hmejl0f,ApprehensiveDig4307,11/28/2021,1,This is good advice. In early 2020 my husband lost his job and by summer I told Hyundai we couldn’t afford our car payments. They did absolutely nothing for us repo’d my car and we turned his in which is apparently a voluntary repo. I actually thought it would destroy us but it surprisingly didn’t. It’s good to know that you shouldn’t be honest.
hmelpxi,Ecstatic_Assumption5,11/28/2021,1,Thanks! I filed a mail form online but still calling them when they open
hmemb3j,theoriginalharbinger,11/28/2021,1,Start of by defining what it is.
hmed0sg,Celodurismo,11/28/2021,1,Others haven’t mentioned this but you can just call it hobby income and be done with it. You’ll pay more in taxes since you can’t deduct anything seeing as you’re talking about 30k it’s probably fair to assume the cost of not deducting business expenses will exceed the cost of an accountant.
hme4k3c,Wandering_Lights,11/28/2021,4,Keep the car and make it work. The i20 isnt that small and its only one kid. Not having any ability to save while having a new kid isnt smart.
hme2j1z,AyeMyHippie,11/28/2021,1,I used to work in a furniture store and it could have been either tbh. They tend to pay low for support staff (the people who move the stuff around help customers load stuff clean the place etc) and get some real dummies as a result. But salesmen also tend to be a little sleazy in most industries and the furniture industry is no different.   The fact that he went out of the way to throw the “incompetent” staff under the bus instead of just saying it was a mistake leads me to believe that it wasn’t just a mix up though. If the guy was willing to talk shit about his coworkers to save some face it’s probably not a stretch to say he’d do some shitty stuff to try to earn a few extra bucks.
hme904k,Unlike_Agholor,11/28/2021,9,You are wrong. an HSA is a savings account that is YOUR money. it does not go away and is yours forever even if you switch employers.
hmdello,rbteeg,11/28/2021,1,Frp nds on how much money you both make.  We make too much each and get fucked.  You can see some tax phase outs at like $400k single $450k married.  The main financial benefit of marriage is you can own property and investments jointly and there is a legal framework for the joint ownership of those assets.
hmdwl7t,roller8810,11/28/2021,1,We one time paid $27 for ultrasound I thought wow that was cheap (we switch to less coverage to chose where we want the kid). Apparently even at that we overpaid and they sent notify and sent us a check 6 months later.
hme4vuc,Ritchie_not_Richie,11/28/2021,1,I was just making a joke. I mean I really kind of do want to do it just to get a little chuckle out of it for myself but it wasn’t like any kind of statement about wealth or anything.
hmej89y,Elk_safe,11/28/2021,1,Im not worried about legal protection. I also dont want 50% of his house?
hmenmhw,CyberMatrix87,11/28/2021,1,Thanks thats very useful :) legal and should often divert paths.
hmek9z4,friedrichpeachy,11/28/2021,1,Right. With the current strategy of maxing retirement contributions out when I factor in anticipated child-related expenses this line item will be small/intermittent.
hmejykd,trevor32192,11/28/2021,1,This sort of happened to me. I contacted my lawyer and emailed them the bill breakdown. You shouldnt be liable for anything prior to the sale. Contact your lawyer or real estate agent. Let them deal with it. My bill was like over 1000 that the seller never paid.
hmej5h9,swamp_fox9,11/28/2021,1,What interest rate is your loan?
hmdfmn3,uptimefordays,11/28/2021,1,No disagreement there! I can see it from both sides many of us spend a lot of time at home might as well have a nice house. Im not going to knock someone for buying a $17000 couch if they can afford it. I will advise against financing a $17000 piece of furniture though.
hmddzgg,cloverdoodles,11/28/2021,1,I mean OP can also just buzz his insurance company and get an answer on coverage. I’ve done that multiple times in the past. It’s like a 20 minute phone call.

hmdxx00,Necromartian,11/28/2021,4,Fuck me i was buying a bed for myself. I found a bed i liked in a price i liked. Sales lady came to me started telling me about all the cool extra features extended varranty and shit i could buy.  I told her Lady you already sold me the bed by not being here. If you open your mouth again i will walk out without buying the bed.  Most of the time its just worth to walk out. Maybe they will eventually learn.
hmemx56,YeetingSlamage,11/28/2021,1,I applied for a credit card in person and was denied on the basis that they couldn’t verify me. Everything else was online I honestly think someone else is using my name
hmeki6o,myze551ml,11/28/2021,1,> But we have become parents 7 months ago and every day it becomes more clear that the car is too small for us.   Im not an expert - but it looks like the Maxi Cosi Mura Plus car seat + stroller combo isnt currently on sale and isnt on the list of car seats compatible with the Hyundai i20.  Rather than spend on a new car - you may want to explore a new car seat + stroller combo instead.. One thats compatible with the car.  Since its just you + wife + child - a Hyundai i20 can work. Its about finding the right equipment that works with the Hyundai instead of looking at specific equipment and then trying to rework the car.

hmde7cp,uptimefordays,11/28/2021,1,I dont disagree but new furniture is a lot more expensive than people think. That said it lasts much longer than IKEA or West Elm stuff.
hmdee10,Cowboywizzard,11/28/2021,1,Just google MRI and the name of your city and you should find imaging centers that will tell you. Your doctor should know about the various imaging centers in town too if they order many MRIs and may recommend options. You can call and ask the imaging center what the self pay price of your MRI is and they will tell you. Self pay is usually less expensive than using your insurance if you have a HDHP insurance plan.  If you have a more traditional insurance plan with a lower deductible you would be better off just paying the copay. If you self pay you can email your receipt to the insurance company and they will apply it to your deductible at least my insurance company will. You can email or call your insurance company and ask them if your insurance works like that too.
hme5kia,MajorEstateCar,11/28/2021,1,That’s because you’re already using those companies and they’re card for those with good credit. Synchrony bank doesn’t know you from homeless Joe and will always run a credit check.
hmdbsux,justLouis,11/28/2021,1,Is your 401k maxed? This will lower your MAGI and you have until April 15 2022 to contribute to your Roth for 2021.   Edit: also contribute to HSA if you qualify will lower your MAGI.
hme8pcf,nolanbowlin,11/28/2021,1,If you refused to buy after that and they stood firm it was a mistake. If you walked out the door they and they came running it was a cash grab. At the end of the day even with it being a mistake they should probably match the price to get a sale. Furniture markup I would assume to be around 30%.

Sorry im not trying to make you feel like it will end up in flames but thats the scenario you want to prepare for.  &#x200B  Just seems like something you can do on ur own since your uncle is willing to help and ur just adding uncertainty into the situation if this was ur wife wed be having a diff conversation but Gfs are a dime a dozen....

hmdwtej,Express_Arugula387,11/28/2021,0,Thank you for your comment. Definitely learning some things I didn’t know before off of this post so thank you for being informative!
hmecyyz,nothlit,11/28/2021,2,You havent messed anything up. Honestly I think people get too worked up about the tiny bit of bonds in target date funds. 10% is practically nothing. So if you prefer the simplicity and hands-off nature of the target date fund there is nothing wrong with sticking with that. On the other hand if you dont mind manually rebalancing every so often doing a split between FZROX and FZILX would be fine too. In that case you might find it preferable to exchange out of the target date fund so you are only managing those 2 funds.
hmdet7i,hippiewitchybitch,11/28/2021,1,Currently closing on a house myself so double check your closing documents. Mine specifically outlines that the seller will have made all utility warranty and contracted payments up to date before our date of possession which then we will take over. Anything outstanding must be forwarded to the seller to pay. These are legal documents with multiple witnesses involved so you should have plenty of room to fight that battle. I would also bring in an inspector immediately to see if theres anything else to worry about. We havent closed strictly because we are waiting on inspection and negotiations.

hme5fq0,AgonizingFury,11/28/2021,7,This could perhaps vary from state to state but at least in Michigan what you say is absolutely correct. Retailers are responsible for ensuring product is correctly labeled and they must honor the advertised price. Additionally if it rings up incorrectly on an electronic scanner and the transaction is completed (you pay) for the wrong amount you have 30 days to dispute it in writing and they must refund you the difference plus a bonus of 10x the difference with a min of $1 and a max of $5 dollars.  If they fail or refuse to do so you can sue them in small claims for $250.

hmdue5r,thunfremlinc,11/28/2021,-1,Bad doctor then.  Mine is perfectly capable of handling it. Couple weeks ago I was told exact prices for optional tests or if there were free alternatives.  It’s not hard. I have an insurance policy on record with the place. Doctors should easily see policy and coverage in any patient management software.
hmdwqa2,LA_Commuter,11/28/2021,9,Thats when you take em to small claims court. Judges usually dont fuck around with stupid warranties.  Used to work for service center and every time we were taking to court for warranty stuff we lost
hmecmtg,intenseapple,11/28/2021,2,You may want to consider renting a larger / more suitable location than jumping right into home ownership. Not only are the downpayment and closing fees on buying a home difficult but between maintenance fees/property tax/insurance/utilities you may be pay much more than you would renting and those fees do not add value back into the home in any way.  May also want to consider stopping the daycare and one person staying at home. Depending on how expensive your daycare is it may be more cost effective to have a single parent stay at home.
hmem2o2,OpeloRoad,11/28/2021,1,Thank you.  This is very helpful.
hmemueb,monirom,11/28/2021,1,I meant more specifically the security of not having a mortgage payment. Im painfully aware of what you mention as Im having to deal with a ceiling cave-in due to my neighbors toilet leaking into my master bath. Getting a General Contractor who can handle all the work vs. dealing with individual contractors to deal with replacing fixtures reglazing the bathtub and doing drywall repairs is a pain. Dealing with the other persons insurance company \*thankfully\* has been a pretty decent experience.
hmegyzt,myprecioussssss,11/28/2021,1,The insurance didnt deny it. OP just has out of pocket. A lot of people are sloppy with the use of the word covered when they dont understand how insurance works.
hmdf75l,LetsBeCoolMan,11/28/2021,1,Awesome that’s good to know!
hmdovw9,Truffleshuffle03,11/28/2021,1,If something happened that highly recommended insurance would say it was normal wear and tear and the claim would be denied. I went through that once and will never make that mistake again. Every claim was denied and was nothing but a hassle.
hmdf6sh,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,1,Will do thank you for this!
hmdfg8n,Dr_thri11,11/28/2021,1,Its pretty universally true.  Stores wouldnt push them if they werent a money maker.  Im just saying if you always decline the warranty youll come out ahead in the long run even if occasionally something breaks before its typical lifespan. If youre financially stable you can afford to just replace consumer goods that break and if you arent you probably shouldnt be buying non-necessitities that drain your bank account.
hmdfp4j,InevitableAd2185,11/28/2021,1,So sorry this happened to you :( fellow Mexican here.  A darle! Suerte!!
hme5o8u,artvamp27,11/28/2021,4,I think that it shouldnt neccesarily be 50/50. I think its  fair for you to pay some but the amount should be more proportional to your incomes.

hme5mrg,BouncyEgg,11/28/2021,7,I’m sure you’re fine with 50% bills food etc.  What are you looking to pay with respect to rent?    Come up with a number.  How did you come up with this number?  Is it $0?  If so why?
hmelx63,CurryMustard,11/28/2021,1,The bubble last time happened because of subprime lending. Anybody could get a loan to buy a house regardless of their financial situation. Banks were incentivized to create as many loans as possible no matter how shitty so they could package them up as mortgage backed securities and sell them.. Then people were unable to pay back their loans. Thats not the issue this time. The cfpb put a stop to that. People are moving out of condos and buying houses at record pace. There is nothing to indicate that a crash is coming. Even if a crash comes the rental market would stay high or go even higher as people who were foreclosed on last time had to move to renting. You could rent your house out and keep building equity while waiting for the market to balance out. Having real estate and building equity is almost always a good investment as long as you are in a steady financial situation (i.e. not a high risk of foreclosure).
hmejgxa,AnonFuckCostco,11/28/2021,1,Thank you for the response!

hme5tq6,avanbeek,11/28/2021,3,There are tax benefits to filing jointly. As an anecdote I would not have qualified for the second round of stimulus checks if I was filing separately because my income was too high. My wife does not make as much as I do so our joint income was within the threshold to qualify for the full stimulus check. It is important to run both scenarios because it depends.
hmdv58y,Orlandor14,11/28/2021,1,Credit card debt is one of the most crippling kinds of debt. The APRs are set against you. People that only pay the minimum is what keep credit card companies in business. I would strongly suggest that you pay off your credit card debt prior to buying a house. Not to mention that it will be extremely difficult to find a bank to loan you the money for a house if you cant prove that you are able to pay small debts such as credit cards..they also greatly negative impact your credit score..its just a ball of negative results when going for a mortgage loan...just my 2 cents
hmelpez,bassjam1,11/28/2021,1,Id recommend doing your personal and business banking at the same place.  Theyll let you have different accounts and then its much easier to move money around if needed.  Thats what my wife did when she started her own LLC and its worked out well.
hmdf83l,newpua_bie,11/28/2021,1,I guess there is a lot of variety then and if you have a defined benefit plan then I suppose that takes the role of the 403b. In my current job I was given 457 and a choice between 403b and a defined benefit plan.

hme9wqj,Apptubrutae,11/28/2021,9,This is basically it.  OP is focusing too much on the trees that they’re missing the forest here.  What the landlord does with the money you pay in rent is beside the point.  You live somewhere you pay rent.  It’s that simple.  If you don’t have to pay rent then lucky you.  But if you do…well it *really* doesn’t matter what happens after it leaves your hands.  Whether the landlord is spending your rent on their mortgage or strippers and blow you still pay your rent and the same amount of money leaves your bank account.  If anything you should be happy in a scenario like this that your rent is going toward’s the mortgage of a boyfriend. Versus a random stranger you may never even meet.
hmed791,on3_3y3d_bunny,11/28/2021,2,The rule of thumb is 1% of the homes value is spent on repairs/maintenance each year. For us that’s about right so far. I’m pretty handy so I can imagine for some it’s 2-3%.
hmdx8tg,lucky_ducker,11/28/2021,1,Yep really common for a non-profit to have a 401(a) that the employer funds with no employee contributions allowed - and its subject to vesting requirements and an optional 403(b) for employees to contribute to.

hmelx4o,bros402,11/28/2021,1,tbh it sounds like this GP could be part of one of those clinics that does it all in one building urgent care etc. so it is probably scummy
hmdnsh6,gammaradiation2,11/28/2021,3,Uhhh I paid 7% on my student loans. Its as toxic as refinanced CC debt apparently only you can bankrupt out of CC debt.

hme8gug,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,-9,The best way to build wealth in the United States is through Real Estate. Buy a home for as little down as possible. Do 5% down conventional mortgage and lock in the low interest on a 30 yr fixed. With your income I would say purchase a 250-300k home. You may wait for your significant other to graduate before doing this just to be in a better financial situation in terms of knowing what your income will be.
hmehn8j,Fish-Weekly,11/28/2021,1,If you make below a certain amount you might qualify for Medicaid depending on your state.

hme28b3,Imadethis4things,11/28/2021,1,Time for a lawyer…preferably the one that handled closing. The utility company “estimating” usage for two years and then trying to pass on a previously incurred debt on somebody else’s contract is some serious BS. Where was the utility company when you established your account at that address? That’s when they verify the meter and document the start of your account from that reading. Did they even bother coming out? Did you save your paperwork from them when you went in and initiated service?
hmdd7ty,nobodyaskedyouxx,11/28/2021,1,Can I ask how is this something I can find out? Shopping around for MRI prices doesnt seem like simple info to find where would I start?
hme63ny,mamun16us,11/28/2021,7,Sounds like you moving in is temporary in which case I’d avoid moving in to complicate things. Unless you guys are getting married before closing on the house you can work with your spouse to get your name added to the deed.

hme7l2l,tstill_,11/28/2021,1,It seems to me like OP was hoping moving the money would impress the “young and attractive financial advisor” and was mad he actually tried to do his job. Then OP wastes the advisors time after moving all the money/stocks around just to say “I’m going to do something else with it and don’t want any advice”
hmdcq6x,Serious-Speaker4668,11/28/2021,1,You are spot on up to #5. Op doesn’t provide anywhere enough relevant information on his situation to make a recommendation on investments.   He/she (insert OP preferred pronouns) appears to be piece of work themselves. Most likely needs someone to protect them from making dumb decisions.   Highly recommend spending more than 10 mins figuring out what the actual goals are then interviewing a couple advisors that specialize in what you’re looking for.   Until then OP is wasting everyone’s time.
hmdz3z3,Unlike_Agholor,11/28/2021,-7,never use HSA money like you’re supposed to. keep it in there and let it grow tax free like an IRA. (unless you absolutely must of course).
hmee3hw,JustMeerkats,11/28/2021,1,Ok that clicked.  Thanks so much!  What if I knew that I was to eventually inherit some other sources of income?  My grandparents did especially well in the stock market and my dad is savvy.  I know that those will eventually be given to myself and my one other sibling. While I dont know the exact amount that they make I know that my dad was able to retire early and comfortably off of the dividends.  That being said I imagine this amount would go towards my taxable/earned income.

hmdc400,Old_Ladies_Die_Hard,11/28/2021,1,In addition to contacting an employment attorney call your state’s labor board. Since she was a contractor they may not be able to help specifically. But depending on the state they *might* be able help. That requesting repayment of gross income may trip up this company. Either way knowing she is going to attack this aggressively might make them back off.   What reason did they give for demanding a refund of all the work she had done for a year?
hmdr0i2,Laney20,11/28/2021,7,Same but one of our options is the lowest high deductible that counts. Its only like $2k. I put enough in my hsa to cover that throughout the year so it ends up not being straight out of pocket but its still kinda rough.
hmdd3mw,doubletwist,11/28/2021,1,Totally. I worked out the numbers on our choices and the monthly premium on the PPO is so high that the HDHP ends up cheaper at the end of the year even if we end up paying out the full family deductible AND the max out-of-pocket for the HDHP - and once you hit the deductible the HDHP pays the same percentage as the PPO. PLUS with the HDHP we can do an HSA so I cant imagine why anyone at our company would ever choose the PPO.

hmdztsl,Appropriate-Sugar-48,11/28/2021,1,If its going to be close Id wait until you do your 2021 taxes and determine your MAGI. You have until April 15 2022 do make a Roth contribution for 2021.  If your MAGI is too high you can consider doing a back door Roth instead (theres a small amount of extra paperwork required at tax time for this but a bigger caveat is that it gets complicated if you currently hold any deductible traditional IRAs). You could also consider not waiting and doing the backdoor Roth now.
hmecgpg,nothlit,11/28/2021,1,Retirement investing is for the long haul. Short term fluctuations in performance do not matter. You did basically the right thing by choosing those index funds. Just stick with it and decades from now you will be doing just fine.

hmeagfc,vikingspam,11/28/2021,2,Its the single most regulated industry we have.  Hows that working out?
hmdsp9a,btonic,11/28/2021,-3,The fact that they are money makers for stores doesnt necessarily mean theyre bad for the individual consumer- if youre smart about purchasing warranties then other consumers are essentially subsidizing your insurance. Picking and choosing effective and reliable warranty programs for items that you might have a higher risk profile for (items that you use significantly more than the average person for example) can save you a decent chunk of change.   Declining warranties in general is a better method than accepting every single one thats offered to you but neither is optimal.
hmdynmp,Far_Sided,11/28/2021,1,Yep I have a fidelity account with 1$ in it. Im not paying the fee to transfer it out and Fidelity seems to want to spend 50c a year in postage sending me paper statements...
hmdx37k,trw931,11/28/2021,1,I dealt with something remotely like this. Once I took control of one of my utilities I was told the previous owner was about 6 months behind on payments.  In my case the closing company took responsibility when I called them and they paid it. They said its a part of the agreement and they will reach out to the prior owner to collect any payment due that they covered.
hmef18y,idothingsheren,11/28/2021,1,A check can clear then come back as invalid *after* having been cleared for a few days

hmelmmo,Michaeldavid198,11/28/2021,1,I made a little over a year of payments with them the first time I financed with them. I then sold my car for a great value as the market is pretty high and they ended up financing with me again. Hopefully this wouldn’t be an issue.
hmdzbxq,animalisticneeds,11/28/2021,8,We also got fucked by that company. Bought a couch there the support straps that hold the cushions up broke in 3 weeks. They came out and told us it wasnt covered under warranty because it was normal wear and tear. How does a 3 week old couch get normal wear and tear to such an extent you cant even sit on it anymore?   My husband wanted to take the couch back in the middle of the night and launch it through the front windows. I talked him out of it even though I secretly wanted the same thing.   Ill never buy anything from Ashley Furniture again and i make sure to tell anyone with ears about them.
hmegb1c,nouseforanametoday,11/28/2021,0,Yeah the only benefit is really inheritance rights and some legal benefits such as being able to make medical decisions. Getting married was not a financial benefit for me and we would have been much better off living together unmarried for several more years.
hmeheig,DoomBuggE,11/28/2021,1,Yes - often when my office has places IUDs our docs like to do a quick bedside sono to check positioning. BUT we don’t scan the image into the chart otherwise the patient gets charged $200-$300 for a 30 second ultrasound that isn’t medically essential but the doc likes to do simply for reassurance. At least they didn’t send you for repeat formal ultrasounds with radiology each time - those are easily $2K-$3K per scan.
hmecaae,j-christopher,11/28/2021,1,Your scenario assumes that something bad happens to someone whos completely unprepared for the unexpected which is an awful way to go through life.  This is what liquid savings is for.  The credit card is a backup.  Overdraft fees are also entirely voluntary.  Its completely irrational to pay a bill with money you know isnt there and then expect there to be no consequences.
hmejlxo,Cha-Car,11/28/2021,1,Yeah.  When the dealership ran my credit the score they pulled was at least 40 point higher than my “normal” FICO.
hme3xwr,NoMoLerking,11/28/2021,2,I think that’s the right answer. As you earn more you can save more but if you’re maxing out a Roth as a teen I think you’re in good shape.    I guess I just know people on both side of too much.    Whatever you do don’t turn into the guy that asks for extra ketchup at Wendy’s even though you didn’t order food just so you don’t have to buy a bottle at home. Also don’t go the other way and eat every meal at a restaurant.
hmdv74r,vice123,11/28/2021,1,Its OK to be frugal until you meet a set goal or have enough money set aside to not really worry about emergencies.   Learning to spend money well and change lifestyle takes time as all things.
hmdckb5,i_am_viet,11/28/2021,1,Great. Go ahead and show these numbers to the dealership you are negotiating with. I am sure they’ll give you the car at the price listed on KBB. Sounds like KBB is all the leverage you need to get the price you want.
hmdcayg,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,1,No signing bonus either
hmedmn5,wanttostayhidden,11/28/2021,5,>Then long term if I get the 401(k) up to 8% that would put me at $19040 for that. Putting both at just below the maxes.  8% would not put you even close to the max for 401k. The 6% that your employer contributes does not count toward your limit.
hme6dba,93195,11/28/2021,3,They’re adults.  You express your concern.  Once.  Then you tell them that you love them and move on.  Their lives their choices (even if bad ones) not yours.
hme7h7q,Billysmith007,11/28/2021,3,Being married is a business merger make sure your partner is good with money along with many other things. Get a plan of saving both do a 401-k go for 12% to 15% saving out of your checks that lowers your taxable income HUGE !!Then just make sure you are getting all the deductions use a good tax person.
hmek5j8,Pezpal,11/28/2021,1,Pay it. You have no recourse. The time to make sure this was taken care of was at the closing table.
hmdc8u8,pajam,11/28/2021,1,We just switched my wife onto my HDHP. Deductible is $6k/year for both of us ($3K per person) but my company also has a Health Reimbursement plan where they cover over a third of that deductible themselves so our deductible is really about $1700/year per person. Also the company gives each of us $840/year in our HSA tax free. So at the end of the day as long as I stick in network my max out-of-pocket is almost $900 (and that is tax free money too). After that no coinsurance no secret gotchas nothing.
hmegvep,DoomBuggE,11/28/2021,1,The EKG prints out the actual waveform readings with a little blurb explaining what the machine has detected (hopefully “normal sinus” but in OPs case it would say something else). Often the written blurb will show up on an electronic patient portal but you can also ask for a copy of the full waveform printout. Since this GP has an EKG and an echo machine on site I wouldn’t be surprised if they charge a per page fee to get a copy.
hmdeh6n,i_am_viet,11/28/2021,1,Like I said go ahead and use KBB to negotiate with. Let’s see how far OP will accomplish with it.  Car dealerships are looking to maximize their profits. They operate with today’s market demand. Their competition is that dealership across the street. And if the competitor is about to realize a sale with plenty of meat on the bone then they’ll do what they can to capture the sale instead. Usually that involves giving up a small piece of the meat. One of the large costs of a dealership is attracting serious buyers.  KBB and other individual value based resources are just that a resource to get an understanding of the market. It is not a strong leverage tool in a negotiation. When you negotiate you don’t point to an average number and say “but people got it at that price!”. You negotiate with showing a real quote from a competitor and being serious about following through with accepting it.  If you want to use an actual dealership value resource then look at Black Book. This is the resource they use when they come up with their prices. But even then this isn’t leverage material.  The population over at r/askcarsales will have a different viewpoint from yours.

hmennlf,Peachesornot,11/28/2021,1,Youre are going to want to find an expert that specializes in disability benefits. You dont want to lose those payments just because you have this settlement. The safe withdrawal rate from stocks is considered 4% per year so youd need a $250000+ settlement to exceed your disability payments.  Ideally you would be able to take interest from your invested money continue getting your disability payments and be able to do at least a couple hours a week of some kind of work from home gig.
hmdzy8l,Fletchonator,11/28/2021,1,I did and about 25k of it was the CT
hmdd7uq,MoonFireAlpha,11/28/2021,1,Having worked in retail most places have insurance on everything. Since it’s usually something you don’t want or because of laziness a lot of employees never ask if you want it. I’m not sure how it works at Costco.   The kind of sale sticker error I can definitely understand as there’s so much turn over in retail and even then usually everywhere is understaffed and so nothing is being done 100% correctly.   The reg not ringing up a sales price is definitely a tactic for the store to make more money but it’s not the individual salespersons fault. I think that’s important to understand. And honestly I always try to make sure the person gets the sale price if it doesn’t pop up automatically and it’s only been one unfortunate time I forgot about it and it turned into a big issue once the customer read the receipt.   Generally saving you money is in the interest of anyone working in retail because if you leave happy you’re more likely to come back and spend more money with us. If you leave upset I’m pretty sure I won’t get your business again.
hme092x,Answerstaxquestions,11/28/2021,3,Hi OP.  Sorry about your accident.  Start reading [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall/) and then move through the sidebar.
hmeg4bi,notveryvery,11/28/2021,2,Understand. From a strictly numbers standpoint you should max the other accounts first and definitely pay HVAC loan before 0% debt but I understand the psychological pull there too.

hmehiye,wicked_flamingo,11/28/2021,1,Microcenter is like the king of customer service. I once purchased a “refurbished” touch screen desktop there. It was out of box and had purchased refurbished items there before. Long story short I drove all the way home 45 minutes to set it up and found dead pixels all down the left side. Drove right back out and come to find out apparently that machine was put out by accident. It had been a return after it was twice sent to them for repair. Before I even had the chance to get upset the repair manager worked with the store manager to get me the same model new in box for the cost of the refurb.   I now buy almost all of my tech there.
hmeks59,LilacStreetCapital,11/28/2021,1,Were the emails actually from Nike? Perhaps the scam is to have you panic click on the “customer service” link in the email which directs you to a fake website which will then “verify” your “order” after you put in your personal information?
hmejc62,AnonFuckCostco,11/28/2021,1,Okay thank you. I’ll speak with my tax person and take her advice on what to put away for the taxes.

hmeaq7l,trevor32192,11/28/2021,-1,I bought my house and only had roughly 3k left over. It really depends on how handy you are and how well you inspect it. So far the only expense over like a few hundred here and there is 1600 for flashing on the roof by the chimney due to a leak. Also aslong as you are able to put a few hundred aside a month it should be fine.
hmdcsjl,uptimefordays,11/28/2021,1,Buying furniture and appliances usually goes this way theres a lot of room for negotiation not unlike a job offer or buying a car. Id ask for free delivery for the inconvenience worst they tell you is no. How bad do you want the couch?
hme7fti,minze,11/28/2021,1,This is incorrect depending on where you are. In a lot of jurisdictions utilities are considered automatic liens and stay with the property much like HOA dues. For example in Philadelphia both water and natural gas are property debt and remain with the property no matter who the owner is. So yes a property can “own” a debt.   It’s actually simpler for the utility company. The debt is with the asset no matter the owner or tenant usually. It’s why I as a landlord keep the water bill in my name and subscribe to the landlord cooperation program with the gas company. With the gas company being part of the LCP allows you to split the debt off the property when needed. In return I agree to provide the utility access to the property whenever needed (generally for shutoff requirements).

hmej5me,Psychonautic339,11/28/2021,1,I understand what youre saying but in this day and age it is so difficult for young people to get a house. Having both names on the mortgage has become somewhat essential. Every single person I know with a mortgage has only been able to get it by having their partner on it as well.   My uncle is a very nice uncle but he wont just give me the money lol. Hes a businessman after all. Any ideas how I could maybe work out a mutually beneficial deal with him?

hme3i7r,FUDnot,11/28/2021,1,They are not required to sell it to you at the sticker price. Customers swap stickers intentionally trying to get a better deal all the time.

I wouldnt shop there again just because of the confusion.
hmds0w8,islangmemes,11/28/2021,1,The issue is his mortgage will definitely be categorized under a jumbo loan which definitely have stricter terms to qualify and usually also means you’ll pay higher interest rate.   OP I imagine you are somewhat recent to this income level? Reason I mention this is because your net worth doesn’t really reflect that of someone who claims to be making 450k a year and has been a high level earner for a while. Your base salary is pretty solid but are you fully aware of how RSU’s work? Usually they’re paid out over time worked at the company as incentive to keep employees employed. Most lenders will not account for this as income as it’s never guaranteed you make it to the tenured date where you receive payout. Something to consider as well.  Also if you’re new to this earning level might want to reconsider the leap to a significantly more expensive house.
hmdfx8c,justLouis,11/28/2021,1,Assuming your yearly income is in the 250-375k and not to exceed this amount by 2-3x for a house your monthly take home is 20-30k is it not? 4.4% interest on your VA loan over 30 years (not exactly sure details) your house payments would be like $3.5-3.8k a month. Either buy a smaller house or Im missing how youll be house poor with your monthly income. Dividends youll get taxed 15%  if you go that route.
hmeniz1,Plead_thy_fifth,11/28/2021,1,so do you think I should sell enough until my taxable income for the year ($15700) and my realized gains add up to $106800? ($80800+ $26000 standard deduction) Or do you think I should sell a little bit more because of the child tax credit?   &#x200B  The vast majority of my sales will be long term capital gains.
hmddqc9,bearjing,11/28/2021,1,Assuming everything else being equal it largely doesnt matter. It just lowers the max amount they will lend you and you dont want to take the max anyways (it just makes you house poor).
hmdcozi,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,1,That is our plan here. Hold our ground and wait to see what they do. We’ll have a law firm in our back pocket in case it is needed
hmdz4dc,9percentmilk,11/28/2021,2,Well the benefits are that you get things like hotels/flights/cash back for free by spending money you were going to spend anyway. But I’ll be honest trying to really micromanage it is probably more effort than it’s worth for most people. I usually recommend people get one decent card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred and then just not think about it too much. The trouble is that people often spend *more* money on their cards than they otherwise would because they start chasing point goals which defeats the entire purpose.
hmdfi2n,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,1,Will contact the labor board. She is a W2 employee. They gave no reason at all. Just an email with a memo saying she owes this much and wiring instructions.

hmejebl,cnoobs,11/28/2021,1,Yeah I like my PPO. The non-ppo option is a $2000 deductible and 57$/pp. PPO is high deductible $2500 but contributing $20/pp + company matching to a FSA my deductible practically pays for itself with the flex savings account and my payment is $61/pp. I’ve spent $0 on health insurance this year outside of pay periods
hmdpnkh,BadDecisionsBrw,11/28/2021,0,Almost all of this labor is very easy to do yourself.  I think that if you are going to bother to buy a house and property you should figure out how to do basic maintenance yourself even if for some reason or another you decide to pay to have it done occasionaly.

hmeio8h,Middle-Management-85,11/28/2021,1,“We’ve done the math and if people to do these specific tests regularly that catches expensive things earlier which means cheaper treatment. So we will specifically discount that to encourage it and lower our overall costs.”  Yes it is wild that we introduce a cost motive into what necessary health care people choose to get. If the doctor says you need it you need it. It’s not like people go out and do cardiogram tests for funsies.

hmefrm1,j-christopher,11/28/2021,1,How soon are you planning to buy a home?  Depending on the answer you may want to split this into two different accounts.  I have zero expectations for returns on our liquid savings (emergency fund) so Im okay with 0.65% from Affirm.  Affirm is better known as the finance company that offers installment loans for online retail purchases for people who cant scrape together $60 at once to get an Instant Pot.  But they also offer an FDIC-insured savings account through a partner bank.

hmdjwya,runsnailrun,11/28/2021,32,This is a sucker test. Anybody can ask for anything and anybody can sue anybody for anything in the US. It doesnt mean theyre going to get what theyre asking for or that they should get it. Youve already reviewed her employment paperwork which has nothing related to repayment of earnings (even if it did it is highly unlikely to hold water legally as a W-2 employee).  Im guessing you and your wife are young without much experience in the work world. Im not a lawyer although I am a business owner. As a business owner I can tell you Im actually shocked that youre entertaining their request. I can only guess its because youre young.  Edit: In the unlikely event they try to sue you for this money its important that you legally respond. If you dont you will lose by default. *The applies to virtually all lawsuits.*
hme927x,jsboutin,11/28/2021,3,Renting isnt throwing away money. Its buying shelter. You also throw away plenty of money buying a home.  Im not in Spain but heres how Id think about it.  - what do comparable places rent for? Assume you can rent it at this price then see if it covers the mortgage and any taxes attached to it.  -How far away from  Madrid are you? Is it a convenient drive or a big pain to do it? Because if you want to rent it you will sometimes have to go check the place out for maintenance or to find a new tenant.  - If you want to rent it out look for middle-of-the-road finishes and quality with durable materials. Depending on the market proximity to transit is often important.  -look out for protections for tenants and landlords in the law. Does Spanish law usually side with the renter? What would happen if a tenant stopped paying? Are you willing to live with that sort of a burden?
hmdpmuw,As_I_Lay_Frying,11/28/2021,1,You dont need to spend that much money to start building a basic wardrobe of decent clothes that fit.  How much can skincare products really cost?

hmdpbz5,biggerfriestofish,11/28/2021,2,Doctors generally do not know how each patient’s insurance company will classify specific codes either.   It’s ultimately on the patient to know their health insurance coverage in advance.

hmdlv3z,Flakmaster92,11/28/2021,3,It’s probably one of those situations where they are pulling in 300 or so different data points at the minimum grade they give for any one data point is 1 rather than 0 or a different number of data points but weighting-adjusted.   Whether that’s still true today who knows I’m sure data points have expanded and the weightings have changed with time but if the weighting came out to like 305 or something “not nice and round” they’d probably just play with the numbers until it was something round. People love round numbers.

hmdk2jy,tvlkidd,11/28/2021,0,In fact your company can ask for the money back. It’s not illegal however it depends on your companies policy.  The company I work for has it stated clearly in the company policy manual as well as when you sign up for direct deposit.  If I were you I would hold some money back (the difference between what you make now and what you think the rate should be).  I would check any policy manuals you might have or company portal.

hmeefvv,hellohellos,11/28/2021,1,i completely agree. if youre living in rustbelt USA and youre able to make the 40k-60k id say thats typically better than living in coastal cities making 60-80k from a financial perspective. and especially if you have friends/family in those areas it would be hard to move given the low cost of living. and in certain industries id recommend living in as low cost of living area as socially possible for you to maximize lifestyle and savings at those income levels.   outside of social reasons it can still make long term sense to move from rustbelt USA to new york or SF and only go from 40k to 60k and maybe even be net negative financially in the short term. the high end of salaries just go so high in those cities getting 200 300 400k is not out of the question in those coastal cities and generally those jobs are very uncommon or might not even exist in those rustbelt cities unless youre a college football coach or something.

I got there from funding vacations finding a wedding and using my credit card so I wouldn’t have to use my debit card.  I grew up poor and my parents weren’t able to teach me any degree of personal finance.   There’s no deposit for most credit cards and (what I’ve learned) is that right before you pay off a credit card the company raises your limit for said card.
hmepep8,OathOfFeanor,11/28/2021,1,That seems like a bit of a gamble.  Someone makes 10k more and now that 30k salary is paying 22% in taxes?  Im not seeing the clear-cut benefits of marriage on taxes here.  Its a maybe at best and will change every year?
