hm7ihbb,Annoying_Auditor,11/26/2021,1,Yes but I just want to make sure people know it doesnt pay for everything. That is not what I was told.
hm7el76,shsc82,11/26/2021,1,Doesnt ssa help pay for college somehow too?
hm8k686,kutes,11/26/2021,1,No Im sorry this is completely on that teller. Ive neevr even heard of something like this its bizarre to me. If hes willing to do this who knows if hes got some weird shit on the go with peoples accounts. He needs to not be involved with peoples finances in anyway shape or form.  Hes already broken Os trust and given him stress this is massively inconvenient.  Maybe he will get a labor job that at least pays decently like the rest of people that dont want to make minimum wage and 30 hours a week.  Seriously what a bizarre thing to do.
hm8hyq6,MDfoodie,11/26/2021,1,People act like they can never again contribute once exceeding the limit. That‚Äôs the entire reason that OP is even asking this question.
hm8hcey,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,1,Call your banks security/fraud reporting number now. Make a record now. Screenshot the fb messenger requests. Be ready to call law enforcement if you believe this person has access to your home address. FB can get the IP address of the tellers computer if needed.   I know its a hassle but Id at least open new accounts if not change banks.   On a personal note Im sorry youve been violated this way. You have a right to the sanctity of your home and peace of your life. This person has behaved so badly  inappropriate barely touches it. I hope youre able to resolve this safely and quickly.  But please dont ignore it. I doubt youre his first rodeo.
hm7lpkm,S_204,11/26/2021,1,> Small by most people  Not my kinda people thats a nice bag of cash for sure! Congrats on being smart about this windfall. Best of luck.
hm6ticu,Frogsplash48,11/26/2021,1,You were right - I had my terms backwards. I selected the HDHP because it offered the HSA.
hm736ep,ahj3939,11/26/2021,2,Merrill Edge isnt bad. You have plenty of no fee low cost index fund options and it counts towards BoA preferred rewards where you can get some pretty good credit card rewards and other perks.
hm75z49,alwaysmyfault,11/26/2021,-16,Pretty sure thats not how it works. If they did that it would become a cashiers check.

hm78h44,metaverse-emperor,11/26/2021,3,This is definitely his rationale. His motivation is that he doesn‚Äôt want to have to financially support me (which is totally not a bad motivation for a parent of a 24 year old). I honestly think I‚Äôll feel more stable in a few more months when I‚Äôm situated - I‚Äôm in a slightly new industry now it‚Äôs not like anything might drastically change because it‚Äôs going well but still getting my bearings on just the way things work so far.

hm7u60a,k_lena,11/26/2021,1,Have you priced a trade in at some place like Carmax? If you can find something on their lot that‚Äôs 8k or less you may be able make enough from the ram trade in to pay off the loan and have no payment going forward.
hm6x2wo,rallyally,11/26/2021,1,I can‚Äôt get anyone to connect me with payroll or anything beyond someone telling me to fill out an HR ‚Äúticket‚Äù. I will try harder to locate those contacts though because I agree they are who is ultimately going to help me most likely‚Ä¶
hm8i43s,TravellingBeard,11/26/2021,1,Please do not excuse shitty behavior.  Benefit of the doubt is reserved for honest mistakes.  This was a deliberately calculated even if it was desperate move by the teller.
hm7pqxt,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,I agree. Just about everyone is hiring and somehow you cant find a job....of any sort? Not even McDonalds will hire you...until you can get something better paying? Sounds like you need to lose the house.
hm6vsvm,MinxManor,11/26/2021,1,Right out of college I worked for a company that tried to cheat me out of 2 weeks pay.   Nothing I did produced a resolution so I filed a complaint with the state (Minnesota) Labor department.    It took about 6 months but I eventually got the money. When it did show up it came in the form of a state check.
hm7csgp,Caleb_Krawdad,11/26/2021,1,Do not email the finance department.  I work corporate finance and this is purely an HR problem that requires an HR solution.  Finance is there to help with internal general ledger accounting or budget questions.  They dont cash payroll checks.
hm8qvi6,MuddyGrimes,11/26/2021,129,Definitely a chance the teller is doing exactly this and just phishing for people the same way they did to OP.   Wonder how many people have given money to the teller
hm836zc,epinephrine90,11/26/2021,1,Call them? I recently called Discover on a $4000 balance and settled it for $1600.   They offered $2600 I told them I can pay $1600 if we settle it today the lady checked if she could accept with manager came back and said we will take it!   I called US Bank to settle $43k on a credit card settled it at $14k I know obviously there‚Äôs tax implications but we will deal with that when the time comes.   Call them!  As for a PFD If it‚Äôs charged off and the issuing bank is TD (I think?) I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôll accept a PFD.. as I‚Äôve tried with Discover US Bank Barclays Synchrony and no banks do PFD‚Ä¶. Usually only Debt purchasers
hm7lf2o,Savvy-or-die,11/26/2021,1,Go into the trades. HVAC Electrician carpentry plumbing.   These fields are absolutely desperate for people. You can call the shots lots of freedom because they know at the end of the day you can get a new job on your lunch break.
hm845ut,RazedByTV,11/26/2021,1,Can you please elaborate on the dangers of using Venmo to pay my landlord?
hm7idu3,SuggestionDistinct51,11/26/2021,1,I dont finance my cars. The vehicles I buy dont typically depreciate and if that doesnt make sense to you think about it. Im not rich but I love cars. üë±‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
hm8byfa,FettHutt,11/26/2021,1,Maxing your contributions is a good thing. At the same time enjoy life with some of the money not that is not invested.
hm7h2q0,smurg_,11/26/2021,1,Even if the estate has enough assets/cash to pay? I doubt that.
hm7ih2u,danas831,11/26/2021,1,Yes do this. My mom wound up in the hospital with a bill over $100k (guillian barre). The hospital got me in touch with Medicaid rep. You will probably have to dig up bank statements and such but they will get the bills covered and get her into a nursing home if she can‚Äôt take care of herself.
hm7pycj,idriveadodgestratus9,11/26/2021,1,No this is not accurate. It just means they are supposed to put your interests in front of their own.  Your best interest is not paying the fee period. They dont recommend that
hm7kbbx,JROXZ,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôd like to chime in as a military brat and friend/family to many in the DOD system. Some KIA some disabled some stayed and have gone full career. There‚Äôs an entire spectrum of outcomes but one certain truth. You will become an instrument of the nation and politics be damed. If they say you‚Äôve been ‚Äúactivated‚Äù whatever straight shot you think you have to starting a career will be met with risk of disability or death.  Really think about what you are willing to risk and if it‚Äôs worth it. Good luck.
hm8gxbe,davematthewstaint,11/26/2021,1,Not to cry wolf but he has access to your address too‚Ä¶might be worth alerting police if you‚Äôre not confident in your home security.
hm8a6b5,WindfallForever,11/26/2021,1,Thank you!
hm7e0t0,gettingbetteralways,11/26/2021,1,I mean this is just false.  What if you owe a loan shark money or they‚Äôre going to take your fucking leg?
hm87kmz,kbragg_usc,11/26/2021,1,Same strategy here.
hm76mxa,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,2,Look into filing for state disability as well as partial unemployment.   At $700 a month before taxes apply for food stamps Medicaid the Emergency Broadband Benefit to use along with a BYOP Lifeline plan (free cellular with unlimited data in California).
hm8sjd4,nails_for_breakfast,11/26/2021,1,If you have any interest in the field at all and dont have a reason to think you will fail a very rigorous background check Air Force IT/cyber security is probably the best bang for your buck for transferable skills and qualifications
hm7f8wa,tastygluecakes,11/26/2021,1,Mortgage is ‚Äúgood‚Äù debt.  Three reasons: tax advantages for interest deductions leverage on asset than generally appreciates at least with inflation (but 5x levered) and right now it‚Äôs incredibly cheap debt.  If I had another dollar right now paying down my mortgage early is about the last thing I‚Äôd do with it.  Retirement savings or other investing is much better in the long run IMO.  And frankly I‚Äôd rather ‚Äúinvest‚Äù in my own happiness today with buying something or taking a trip.    For some there is a sense of security/comfort in paying off mortgage.  Which is fine if that‚Äôs you.  You are buying peace of mind.  But from a strictly financial POV it‚Äôs a low yield return.  Edit: this thinking applies to people who are generally in good shape and responsible with their finances.  It sounds like you are.  For people with poor credit and money management paying down your mortgage early is forced savings on money you might otherwise blow on consuming.  But again doesn‚Äôt seem like that your situation OP.
hm7idva,danger_close7,11/26/2021,1,I did too but I would say it is still a good financial option  because you graduate with a free degree that you‚Äôll have for life and a relatively well paying and secure job for at least 4 years to pay off said loans. There are ways to be frugal such as being an RA in college for free housing and having a work-study job to minimize the loan amounts.
hm7kp6t,Econ0mist,11/26/2021,1,This is called Coast FI or barista FI. You might look into the /r/financialindependence subreddit
hm77b5p,SecretExplorer355,11/26/2021,1,still that‚Äôs about 12 hours unaccounted for
hm8cm3x,bigandfullballs,11/26/2021,1,People like you make me money thank you.
hm73l1j,WantToRetireSomeday,11/26/2021,2,I like NewRetirement.com. It‚Äôs not fancy but does pretty much everything you are looking for. it‚Äôs $75/yr. It estimates taxes RMD‚Äôs inflation (adjustable) social security etc.   This will get downvoted as most here like personalcapital ynab or mint.
hm7fopr,DigitalDeath12,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôd much rather a young service person would buy a crotch rocket over any sports car. They force you to go through their safety course in order to ride the motorcycle on base. When I was in the Navy they would have monthly rides scheduled where everyone on base would take a 3-4 hour ride together.
hm6uv9x,Ecstatic_Being8277,11/26/2021,1,Per KBB $20K in repairs would make almost all 2018 Rav4s a total loss since more than 50% of the cars value was declared as loss.

hm86xpc,UnPrecidential,11/26/2021,1,I have received two checks in one envelope too each from a different customer. I almost did not notice the second check and nearly through it away with the envelope it came in.
hm7x5m6,ChumpChainge,11/26/2021,1,Get Stash and invest it. I‚Äôve made 35% return in just over a year. Compounded over time it could really add up.
hm7dxv4,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,While 3.5% isnt high it isnt low either.  Saying that your rate is already locked is a potential concern.  It may cost you money to back out of the loan at this point.  You should get quotes from two additional lenders.  Dont bother bringing up the construction discussion or you might end up with a construction loan.  What you want is a cash out refinance.
hm7d20t,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,FICO does not produce a score until you have your first credit account for 6 months. Even then it is still very thin file but should qualify you for some of the good enough unsecured cards.
hm77qro,AdditionalAttorney,11/26/2021,1,üëç go in assuming it was a weird administrative glitch.  Maybe the clock in/clock out didn‚Äôt register for one of your shifts
hm8jkej,Jeabers,11/26/2021,1,Makes it even worse. I would speak to the manager as well as call/tweet/email corporate customer service.
hm6xjes,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,She lives outside the US so cant really be collected on and sued. Hence no immediate reprocussions.  But if she returns to America she may have a financial/credit mess to deal with.
hm8fa9v,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,Insurance follows the car not the driver almost everywhere.  But insurance companies have rules about who needs to be listed as a driver in order to rate properly.  As a general rule of thumb most insurance companies will require that anyone who regularly operates the vehicle be listed on the policy.
hm8fi9s,SlowJamm,11/26/2021,1,Like I said OP going to have to chose to really hurt this guys life over this. Some mistakes you gotta learn from. Just seems harsh to me to get him fired but I see both sides.
hm873kd,matttheepitaph,11/26/2021,1,If after 90 days the check isnt cashed they return it to your accout. They did not return it to your account. Therefore he can take it up with the bank.
hm76ltb,Omynt,11/26/2021,1,Here are some cards the author claims are [no-balance-transfer](https://wallethub.com/credit-cards/no-balance-transfer-fee/) fee offers.
hm8826u,93195,11/26/2021,1,Value of a car with a salvage title is indeed about half of KBB so the price is right in line with where it should be.  The important thing is to have a qualified mechanic inspect it thoroughly.  If the mechanic agrees the repairs were done right and as long as it‚Äôs priced right go for it as long as you understand the risk.

hm7phly,chopsui101,11/26/2021,1,only if your health plan eligible

hm8cm0s,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,People have no idea how taxes work. They are confusing capital gains taxes with sales taxes and income tax.
hm7kaul,martinluther3107,11/26/2021,1,Some banks take the money from your account into the bill pay vendors account immediately.  then once the check is negotiated the money will go from the pill pay account to the payees account.
hm8tvsb,Chicken-n-Biscuits,11/26/2021,47,In 1999 I made $7.50/hour working as a teller at a regional bank in Louisiana which was at least $1 more per hour than I earned working at a clothing store called Structure at the the same time and $2.35 (46%) more than minimum wage at the time. That said there are lots of ‚Äúuppity‚Äù people who work in the lowest ranks of what they consider to be grand institutions (e.g. retail banking law offices luxury retail).
hm7gsw9,Tylus0,11/26/2021,1,Take the car to Guam and sell it there. Cars are scarce out there and a nice car is in high demand. Guam bombs rule the road out there  Unless it‚Äôs a POS I‚Äôd pay to ship it. You‚Äôll still need a car on the island. And you‚Äôll pay a premium on island to purchase a POS
hm7u41p,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,1,Then we agree. As I said before the terms outlines the liabilities.
hm77800,UncleMeat11,11/26/2021,1,> Still you‚Äôd be insane to pass up 7.12% risk free.  It isnt 7.12% risk free. It is 3.56% risk free (it adjusts after six months and you dont know what the adjustment will be).   And I dont think youd have to be insane. If you are in 100% equities because that is what risk profile you want then it doesnt make much sense to change course because of hunches.
hm84zi6,slimyprincelimey,11/26/2021,1,I ACH stuff all the time in the US.   But America bad.
hm7yqkh,hjthrone,11/26/2021,1,Yes I figured with our lower income and lower daycare expenses the credit would benefit us more but I just felt like I needed verification! Appreciate it.

hm76gxn,inkheart58,11/26/2021,1,I should firstly point out that I have no financial qualifications just an interest in sustainable personal finance.  This is the first I‚Äôve heard of Stablecoin üòÖ but from what I am reading it seems to be stabler due to the fact that it is backed by a physical asset. Whilst this is theoretically stabler than normal crypto I would still class it in a similar category to something like FX trading or investing in individual stocks. You‚Äôre still investing in single entity with a single point of failure. If Elon decides to start keyboard bashing Stablecoin there‚Äôs potential for that 9% ROI to quickly switch to big losses.  On the other hand investing in a diverse investment fund like many of the ESG ones will distribute this risk over many entities spanning different industries currencies and countries. Elon can‚Äôt influence that on the same level.  These may have a lower return than 9% but generally much safer and you can leave your money in them with little maintenance required.  Also Stablecoin doesn‚Äôt seem to be any different to other cryptos when it comes to the environment.  Crypto is an exciting and very interesting technology that can have impressively high yields but so can gambling. And aside from the returns we must also question whether it is responsible to back something that requires racks of GPUs running 247 doing intensive computation at the expense of co2 emissions.

hm76iay,wilderop,11/26/2021,1,E5 makes 5k a month when you include housing allowance in a high COL area so not surprising that higher ups are making double.
hm8sj6m,thefooz,11/26/2021,2,>	Eg: the teller shared your bank account balance with a friend in passing and that friend decided to act as him or whatever  This is just as bad if not worse. How would you feel if your bank teller was telling shady people about you and your account balance? What if you were loaded and they decided to kidnap your kid instead of contacting you on Facebook? This person should not be given the benefit of the doubt.
hm8pnu3,jasperjava,11/26/2021,1,Make sure you can register and insure a salvage vehicle in your state. Some states are more friendly towards this and others have a million requirements/inspections that need to be met.

hm77lcn,Xenikovia,11/26/2021,1,I dont understand every check that clears your bank \~ there is a digital record of the front and back of the check. Walk into your branch and speak to the bank manager. If the funds were taken out of  your checking account the bank has to provide proof of it.
hm7j06l,vancityvapers,11/26/2021,1,Lol 163 other people seem to have no idea how ACH auto pay works with Chase either.
hm8fkmh,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,VA loans are VA loans.  Talk to navy fed or usaa for a pre-qualification before you make assumptions.  You could also move to a lower cost area.  With 100% disability there is very little financial incentive to stay in a high cost of living area unless you are able to also hold a high paying job.  As a generalization those jobs usually arent the most accommodating to vets with disabilities.  If you are looking for work Im always looking to hire vets and have positions all over the west coast.
hm81g1p,Wahoo2K8,11/26/2021,1,If you have uninsured motorist coverage this MAY qualify under that coverage.  However this is state specific.  Some states require the other driver to be identified for uninsured motorists coverage while others do not.  If you don‚Äôt have uninsured motorists or this does not qualify under that coverage your next option would be to file a claim under your collision coverage.  If you don‚Äôt have collision coverage there isn‚Äôt much more you can do.  If you vehicle is totaled and you have the appropriate coverage you mr insurer will pay you the actual cash value of the vehicle minus your deductible.  If the vehicle is repairable they will pay the cost to repair minus your deductible.  Honestly there‚Äôs a TON of ‚Äúif this happens then this wil occur‚Äù situations.  So you really need to either share your state and coverages (if you know your coverage) or cal your insurer to determine what coverage you have.
hm8r9t8,Immediate-Joke8605,11/26/2021,1,That chart is beautiful. Thanks I need to invest in stock really

hm6t8id,Missykay88,11/26/2021,1,We have 3 bills on autopay on that card currently. We also pay the entire balance (not just for statement period) off every month. And I went back to the first statement and it charged interest on that as well. Its never had a balance on the due date as its always been paid in full 5 days before the due date.
hm7qade,kalirion,11/26/2021,1,If the bank cant tell him it was cashed then they shouldnt be able to tell him they cant stop it.
hm8jyqy,LooksAtClouds,11/26/2021,3,You have to make sure the brokerage knows that the contribution is for 2021 if youre making it in 2022.
hm8aqze,MaCuban,11/26/2021,1,I also imagine that the clearing time for ACH/Checks or any other EFT (except wire) is a HUGE risk/fraud mitigator.  As inconvenient as it is I imagine the cost of fraud would be greater without it. eg: try reversing a wire after it clears.  other instant payment options are essentially shifting that risk off the traditional bank but i am sure in the fine print of those services it is mostly on the customer.
hm8qat2,hiddenuser12345,11/26/2021,1,This is a bit more basic advice but if you‚Äôre looking to avoid banking fees go with Capital One for both checking and savings. For your liquid savings (emergency fund- if something suddenly happens you want to be able to access that money straight away) they‚Äôve got the highest interest rate of any bank in the area with physical branches (you‚Äôll find some banks with higher interest rates but they‚Äôre online-only and online banks usually won‚Äôt take you if you‚Äôre not a citizen or permanent resident). For checking they charge the fewest fees- no foreign transaction fee no monthly maintenance fee no out-of-network ATM fee no incoming wire fee you kind of get the idea.
hm8qz9t,GTFonMF,11/26/2021,188,It‚Äôs still that way.

hm7h2js,Duc748s,11/26/2021,1,This .....  Also when my twsp does assessments they usually notify the homeowners before hand and they also send out yearly assessment cards with the breakdowns Total Land Dwelling etc.... (I want to say around Tax time)
hm8p7ob,tacotruck2112,11/26/2021,2,Me again...and to your other questions:  Yes you should do an in-service rollover if you can to save fees and get more investment opportunities (like VTI).  Id probably do it once per year since your 401k plan probably has a transactional fee assessed to your account each time you move money out.  Note: doing so may cause tax complications with backdoor Roth conversions (google Roth IRA pro-rata rule).

If you join you wont be able to take college for the first year due to training. After that its free. Four years is not a lot of time.  Also get a guaranteed job before going in!

hm8isq8,Kabby360,11/26/2021,1,Honestly I‚Äôd recommend airforce for just a better quality of life. You also have access to TA (tuition assistance). They‚Äôll pay for a degree at each level while active duty 1 associate bachelors masters‚Ä¶etc. typically 6 classes in a fiscal year. You also have the GI bill which is it‚Äôs own thing and will pay for a degree as well. TA is for active GI bill is active or once your out.   Military is a pretty good stepping stone depending on the MOS/AFSC you get. If you have any questions let me know. Been in for 10 years and joint environment entire time so familiar with all branches minus coast guard
hm8qty3,throwawy12347,11/26/2021,2,There are a lot of jobs right now you could make more than 33k per year working full-time. That only comes  out to $16 per hour for a 40 hour week. If you are in grad school then you must have a bachelors degree which would likely up your earning potential. I would think theres a lot jobs you could  make $20-22 per hour at I would look around and see what else you could get. Id also apply for all the assistance you could get too like section 8 SNAP energy assistance daycare assistance.

The last one that comes to mind was a gym that kept charging $100+ despite the dispute and even his account manager (private/wealth client) sending an email and letter to the business. The dispute was specifically written that the business refused to answer demands to cancel. They kept charging and I removed his recurring billing indicator which is when they sent it to collections. Their lawyer made quick work of them with the evidence documents provided from initiating the dispute from the card networks.

hm7j4kf,faldore,11/26/2021,1,You need to decide what job you want in the army.  There are 2 choices.  1) pick something thats marketable in the real world. Or 2) decide up front you want to stay in until you retire then you can go ahead and do whatever you want instead of whats marketable.   You need to score 99 on the asvab. You need to get it in your recruitment contract in writing that you will be assigned to the job you want. You need to hold them to that and be prepared to walk away if they try to take it away.  Without getting assigned specifically to the job you want the army is a bad deal and you should instead go to community college on Pell grants and Stafford loans and get a transfer degree.

hm79420,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,2,> in the event of her death I would be liable for any balance remaining on the card.  This is inaccurate.  Look youre probably worrying over nothing.  If mom has good credit and adds you as an AU on her CREDIT card then YOU get her good credit that is tied to the card added to YOUR credit report.  If moms credit is bad then the bad will also get added to your report.  But its easy for you to remove because youre just an AU.  So unless Mom has bad credit just leave it be.
hm849gk,oceanleap,11/26/2021,1,That would be a good question for your tax accountant. It will still likely be best to make a will so th at any remaining assets can easily be settled. So maybe a trust is not necessary? But the kids would likely get their inheritance faster with a trust.

hm8mzug,CyberSecurityGuy1,11/26/2021,1,I reached out to their customer service and they stated your principal is in the pooled account and is not at risk for loss just the gains if there is a serious event. No other loss to consider.  So the way I see this its pretty risk free.
hm75eqq,jimspokane,11/26/2021,3,The bank will catch it at some point in the following year after death.  The social security administration distributes a ‚Äúdeath master file‚Äù that has all SSN‚Äôs of deceased individuals.  Banks regularly cross reference their database of open accounts against the DMF and close or do further investigation of any matches.  Once they find account of a deceased person with active use after the date of death it won‚Äôt go well for those still using the card.  Closed for fraud is not a good thing to have on a credit file and if you are an authorized user the close reason code will show on your credit report.

One of my first renters lost their job and couldnt pay rent right before Xmas and I ended up letting them stay for a couple months and let them get out of the lease without going after them for fees etc as long as they left the place in a state where someone else could move in right away. They kept their end of the bargain and I kept mine.
hm86g1r,CoeusDarksoul,11/26/2021,1,Thats not what you said. You said that Bill Pay removes the funds from the account.

hm7fd13,Inb4BanAgain,11/26/2021,1,R/DaveRamsey  People criticize his investment strategy and his faith but his whole schtick is helping people go from being up to their eyebrows in debt to winning and pulling ahead financially. You may get advice you dont like there like cut the gym maybe even scale back the hsa until you get a win or two under your belt and start getting some breathing room anyway.  Youve got 50 bucks a week to start pounding on your smallest debt and start your snowball thats not insignificant at all. 50 little wins every week add up to big wins over time. Anyhow if you check them out theres a large community of people all with a common goal and theyre usually quite supportive too.
hm8i0df,LiteBulb88,11/26/2021,1,Buy low and sell high not the other way around. So if the market does go into a significant correction you should be looking to buy not sell.

hm8rlog,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,3,Unfortunately the key word is individual.  If the parents had given the car to them for $50 the rest of the value of the car would be considered a gift.  But since it was a business it is not considered a gift and their cost basis is $50 instead of fair market value on the date they bought it.
hm76dx1,j0nnyc92,11/26/2021,2,Im in the Army and have been in the regular army and in Special Operations. The Army can be a great stepping stone to move up in the world financially. You can learn skills that will translate to outside work (MOS dependent) and you can save and make a lot of money while youre in. The GI bill is an excellent tool to help pay for college and you will get a rather large stipend to pay for food and housing while in school. Joining the Army for 4 years can be worth it. It can also not if youre responsible about what you do with your time or finances.
hm7w0d3,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,1,See? This is another one of those choices I was talking about -- find your comfort level.  Ive lived through some disasters where the electricity was out for days to weeks. Cash was king. I was grateful for having our version of a go bag with cash. I lived through the week of no markets after 9/11. So Im somewhat jaded about how fast you can pull your moneyif you have to. As you can see for me my choices make sense.  I know my comfort level and what I value most. Knowing I have cash in hand vs making as much as I possibly can was and is a fair trade in my world.  It really is like say a Ferrari. Sure its pretty and fast but I am willing to pay the cost? Everyone has a different answer. For me I was and am willing to pay the price for the certainty that an emergency fund in both cash in hand and a high yield savings account brings me. No doubt  it has the potential to earn much higher yields but  the risk isnt it worth it to me. So my investments are money I can part with if I had to.   Choice doesnt mean right vs wrong. Its more about fit in my opinion. Your choices fit you. Mine fit me. Its a  life to live not a game to win.

hm83iee,Specific_Emu9399,11/26/2021,1,There are usually local mortgage lenders all they do are mortgages and they will be the best bet. Be very clear with your rep what you want from the beginning and what you want to bring to closing pay towards closing costs in this case from your cash-out. This Includes things like paying for points for a lower interest rate.   Be ready to get all the paperwork you needed for your first purchase the second time around sometimes it‚Äôs a pain in the ass but it‚Äôs worth it.

hm803cj,Floomby,11/26/2021,1,This is a bit more helpful than the Wikipedia article. TLDR: if you cant take this on youre probably off the hook cant squeeze blood from a stone.

hm8k1k1,UGA10,11/26/2021,1,Start by contributing to your 401(k) at least up to the employer match.  Choose low cost index funds and look for a total US index and an international index.  Then create a budget so that you can determine what is left each month.  This will also help you determine your mo they expenses and help you establish an emergency fund.   Once you have an emergency fund consider using some of the $80K in your bank account to fund a Roth IRA for 2021 ($6000) and then in January fund it again for 2022 ($6000).  You could then consider increasing your 401k contributions over the enouer match depending on your budget.
hm7mh59,aust_b,11/26/2021,1,Down payment would be entirely on what the group together would be qualified for with a bank.

hm7yj44,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,Given your high income (and surprisingly high retirement account for your ages) Im not too concerned here.  A few questions:   - Transportation	$849 - what is this? Car loans gas and insurance?   - Home Maintenance - this seems high unless its an older house IMO    Per question #2 I feel like housing prices are still quite out of whack at this point. Houses are getting snapped up within days generally over list price. If youre not in a significant rush it may not hurt to slow down a bit. Moreover if the market goes topsy-turvy again with the new COVID-19 variant (Im not saying it will but it isnt 100% out of the question) things could get interesting again.

hm892oy,jgbro,11/26/2021,1,I didn‚Äôt see you answer what the interest is on your student loans? That would be my deciding factor on how quickly to repay them. You definitely need a little emergency fund too but do you live at home with your parents? If so you don‚Äôt need as much as someone with their own house. I don‚Äôt think you provided enough information to answer this correctly.
hm78w4l,Aiorr,11/26/2021,0,There is really no minimum payment in student loanv(unless you sign up for specific repayment plan like income-based) and grace period / covid forgiveness complicates this.    And I advised OP to pay even tiny bit monthly a pseudo-minimum payment.  Not making dent would imply not even paying those bit.
hm76tcq,AltOnMain,11/26/2021,1,It‚Äôs not really bad advice but you should be capturing the company match if at all possible.  The idea with paying off the student loan is that they are high interest so assuming your interest rate is 6-8% paying more than the minimum could be thought of as a guaranteed 6-8% return. Your company match is also a guaranteed return is a sense.  I think you could look at it a few different ways but you could make arguments for either. The match would have a much higher return but you can‚Äôt really use the money for 30 years so the net present value is much lower.
hm8h9xg,AdamYmadA,11/26/2021,1,It‚Äôs very difficult for him to steal your money without getting caught.  Him messaging you on Facebook doesn‚Äôt help.   Me personally I would just move the money but honestly if you track debits and credits you should be fine.
hm7k5q2,CoolNebraskaGal,11/26/2021,1,Distributions from Inherited IRAs are taxed as income. There is no early withdrawal penalty. If this pension plan allows it to be transferred to an Inherited IRA that is probably the best option. But you can only do this as a direct transfer. If the pension requires a lump sum payout this will not be an option. It really depends on the pension (defined benefit? Defined contribution?)  In general you can not convert traditional Inherited IRA to Roth as a non spouse. But you could conceivably receive this money tax free from the pension. You need to look at the specific pension plan info. I believe the IRS info you are quoting only specifies Roth because you can inherit pretax and post tax accounts. You cannot just choose Roth it has to be a Roth eligible direct transfer to a Roth Inherited IRA.

hm75ij4,unchinhairs,11/26/2021,1,There are lots of meal kit services with varying cooking requirements. Some come with everything pre-measured you just cook it yourself. Others come with the entire meal already prepared you just heat it up. Similarly you can often buy prepared food at a grocery store. Check out the frozen section as well so you have meals that can be eaten anytime. There are also many quick sides that you can put together so that you have staples at the ready with minimal effort. Minute rice and frozen broccoli have been my staples for when I am too drained to cook at all.  You can take it slow. Grub Hub can become a habit if you do it for every single meal so I wouldnt expect you to immediately quit. Give yourself a goal to reduce your ordering habit over time.  Lastly if you do deliver try to optimize. Often when I get delivery I will order enough for multiple meals. Some meals I can easily stretch with things I have at home. Like I will cook some rice heat up a frozen vegetable in the microwave and make my delivery leftover last an extra meal.

Ive read the post and most of the comments and unfortunately I dont think it applies to my situation I might try to reach out to my bank as a last resort. I just wish I wouldve known how unreliable they were and how the whole procedure worked before getting into all of this.
hm8f1lh,ThisIsAMonere,11/26/2021,1,Just like there is federal capital gains taxes on literally anything you buy for a low price and sell for a higher price not just cars.  OP you are correct.  You bought an item for $50 and then you sell it for $5000 then yes those earnings are subject to capital gains taxes.  The fact that it‚Äôs a car is irrelevant. It‚Äôs that you bought something for a low price and sold it for a higher price.
hm7a2un,Uniqueiamjustjules,11/26/2021,1,This x1000. Everyone I know who got the most out of their military service planned it out. Theyll get out of you what they want but you need to reciprocate the same planning.  It can work out quite well if done with forethought.   Most of the successful millennials I know served 4+ years. The most successful discharged at 12+. I think were just entering the full 20+ service and many of those will be set for life when they pivot into civilian life.

hm6xk7z,greem,11/26/2021,4,Small landlords get a lot of shit on Reddit. Im still not sure why. If you pay on time and dont break things I cant see how that many people can be slum lords.  Most of the time our interests are aligned. Live in the place. Pay the rent. Take care of the place. Let me know if something needs to be fixed. Easy.  Its been disappointing when Ive had to turn down tenants who had unreasonable expectations of what they could afford. I dont want the place vacant willy nilly because it costs me money to find a new tenant but there is no way I want someone forced to live in a place they cant afford.

hm7khys,kbfprivate,11/26/2021,1,There isn‚Äôt enough information to really make a black or white decision. So like most answers it depends on more than what we understand.  OP is 24 and most people in there 20s won‚Äôt stay at a job for more than a few years. If there is a vesting period of 4 years and OP stays 2 the match isn‚Äôt going to mean as much.

hm8izjs,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,1,Okay let me blunt.   We all like to tell ourselves fairytales to make  ourselves feel better. This man has access to your full name home address  phone number Facebook account and everything this bank has authorized him to see.    He chose to victimize you. Ya know how you get to be good  at being at bad guy? You choose victims not likely to get you caught.   Call the banks security/fraud number NOW.   This man is a threat to you your money his employer and God knows who else.   You feel violated because you have been violated.   If you knew a criminal had gotten your banking information your ssn address  etc and contacted you on Facebook asking you for money what would you do? What would you tell your mother to do? What would you tell your daughter to do?   THIS GUY IS A CRIMINAL.   Lets hope its limited to being a con-artist.  Please put a freeze on your credit right now.   Please be safe.

hm7kjhy,PentagonUnpadded,11/26/2021,1,Closing the robbinhood account is probably a good idea. It is one of the most gamified UIs of investment brokerages and engagement harms long term investment outcomes. Especially since the account isn‚Äôt an IRA so transactions and dividends incur a tax bill. In surveys of individual investors those that lost their password and were dead outperformed  their active peers since they didn‚Äôt change their strategy.   ‚ÄúBlue chip‚Äù stock picking is an investment error for the nonprofessional long term investor. Portfolios of individual stocks with less than 50 holdings have volatility much higher than VTI and VXUS.

hm70dhp,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,So not sure what to tell you. If you cant make the payments then you stop paying. Clean it up later before you come back home.  You could do credit counseling agency which would lower your interest but still require some sort of smaller payment.  You can file bankruptcy while you are out of the country but that will cause 10 years of credit damage.

Once you can separate wants from needs a bit better you can follow the steps there and prioritize things. I wouldnt be making a car payment in your situation. I would get real about your food budget if youre constantly planning on going over.  I would definitely move back in with your parents but until you can get real with yourself that extra money isnt going to solve your problems.
hm7jc0q,Werewolfdad,11/26/2021,1,Leave it to Reddit to bring out outrageous exceptions just to act like I‚Äôm not right.    I guess If there‚Äôs a world ending meteor headed towards earth you can skip the match too.

hm8emf0,pfinancelurker,11/26/2021,1,VTI will do 10% on average (nominal) over long investment horizons. 60% (whatever that may be in dollar terms) likely isn‚Äôt worth going exploring alt investments.
hm6wry9,joey_subie,11/26/2021,1,Yes we are currently living in it.   And yes ive done my fair share of watching my homes value go up in a short amount of time in this market  makes me feel like I need to act fast. However my dilemma is figuring out the next step if we sell- where will we go?   Should I rent it out while we live somewhere else?  But due to our low income at the moment  I dont know how profitable that would be for all the work that goes into renting out / listing / etc.   Dont have great credit so it may not be the smoothest journey to just rent anywhere I please.
hm6zh2z,SchismSX,11/26/2021,0,I don‚Äôt think I would have a problem with that possibility

hm7s79s,93195,11/26/2021,1,That‚Äôs the smart thing to do.  That said it‚Äôll take you a bit to unfreeze all three find the passwords go on the websites or call anytime you need new credit.

hm8d8wc,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,Yeah that‚Äôs the thing I‚Äôm struggling with but I figure a few years from now I can just pull out of VTSAX if it‚Äôs green. Doing the math 4 years of 400 bucks is almost 20k and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd regret having that compounding for older me if it means I only have 144k cash saved for a house which is way more than what I‚Äôd need for a down payment for a FHA or VA loan (0-3.5-5%).   I just need 1-2 years of work history but I‚Äôm working on education so..  Yeah man I don‚Äôt know
hm7fcvy,CoffeeKadachi,11/26/2021,1,I mean I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs meaningless. It‚Äôs a good starting point when you make a variable amount.   Definitely not a hard and fast rule but obviously it‚Äôs something you‚Äôd adjust for your needs.

hm823pd,rawdoogie,11/26/2021,1,Used cars are a ripoff right now. Even if your income + NW was different my opinion would be the same. Youre talking about 50k miles of wear and tear and an expiring B+B warranty for only 5k savings. Comparing (2019 Camry Hybrid LE $27500 50k miles) in my local Autotrader to NEW listings (2022 Camry Hybrid LE MSRP $28664) I see an even smaller gap in my area (1-3K) in some cases the used 2019s are listed for MSRP!!!!!! This doesnt even factor in the reduced interest rates you can get on a NEW vehicle. Basically free money with the inflation that we are seeing. I wont even go into wear and tear over 3 years and 50k miles.  The age old thought process that buying a new car is bad does not apply in this market. Used car prices have inflated so much that the savings of buying used no longer beats  buying new IMO. Id go for manufacturers that dont typically have crazy cash on the hood deals during the normal markets and typically sell closer to MSRP (Toyota Honda Subaru Tesla etc.)  Buying a new car is going to take some effort in the current market. You will need to make some calls or site visits and find a dealer that is selling at MSRP with no BS markups or addons. They do exist but you will need to do some hunting. Once you find one easiest thing to do is put in a factory order for what you want and take delivery in 3+ months. Or you can choose from an inbound vehicle and put down a deposit. This will be faster than a factory order. Some manufactures (Toyota is one) DO NOT do custom factory orders. Instead they only allow you to make a selection from their inbound factory allotment. For your Camry you will need to ask the dealer to go through their inbound inventory and choose which one you want to put a deposit on. My local Toyota dealer has inbounds that are about 4-5+ weeks out depending on model.  Good luck!

hm84iic,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,You‚Äôre taxed based off how much the asset is worth not how much you paid for it. Also taxable gains is definitely not the same as capital gains taxes.
hm6tz8q,SuckaPunchSpliff,11/26/2021,1,Sounds like a good idea. Now would it be smarter to put down a large down payment or pay off my debts? Think my loans are around 2-4% interest rates.
hm77y1p,metaverse-emperor,11/26/2021,10,Monthly expenses would have been good to include. I live in an expensive city so I spend about $3K per month after rent groceries entertainment etc. I technically could not survive for longer than 3 weeks on my current savings but my parents live nearby are well-off and have a good relationship with me so they‚Äôd always be there to help me out in an emergency. (Not that I want to rely on that though.) If I contributed 6% it‚Äôd be a bit slower to grow savings but it would still be growth.
hm6ys63,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,Hey yep indeed:  My ideal plan would be to get back to work as soon as I can after my program and pay the debt down ASAP thereafter though Im aware Bank of America dont do deferrals.   By my statement I mean to say that my bad credit rating in the US doesnt have any bearing on my finances in Ireland so I technically still have a good credit rating here.   I have enough money to get myself through the degree but I dont have enough to spare to make even minimum payments. I want to pay back the bank but I literally cant at the moment.  Thanks for the link to the credit repair -- Im very conscious of what Ive done to myself with regard my credit rating but I guess I chose to gamble on earning more year on year

hm8k8f6,SlowJamm,11/26/2021,1,For someone to see 6 months of living expenses and think someone is just going to give some away is moronic. Im coming more towards the side of reporting him. I see the valid points.   If it were me though Id block him and move on. No fear of relation and get a new bank. If he does it again let it be someone elses problem.   Lastly why would someone ever speak up in a bad neighborhood? Live in fear and possibly danger over something someone else did? Or try to live in peace in a hard situation. Its not like their one act of speaking up changes anything or would 100 acts of speaking up. Some changes needed are to big to blame on them not speaking up is the reason their neighborhood is bad. Such bad logic
hm83rx4,TrumpsBoneSpur,11/26/2021,1,Call your insurance company and tell them what happened.  You can get an estimate for the damages (should be free) and then decide if you want to submit a claim.

hm7bre6,SomethingAbtU,11/26/2021,1,Its 11/2021. Why is this landlord now telling you this many months later?  Are they attempting to charge you interest or any late fees?  Is this a giant rental property management company with sloppy records and incompetent staff?
hm80w63,GreedyNovel,11/26/2021,1,I inherited a house as well not that long ago. I eventually decided to put it up for sale its under contract now.  The property is actually pretty fantastic but my parents had very different needs in mind when they bought it that dont suit my needs - selling it was a fairly easy decision.  Thats really what I think matters most - does owning the house meet your housing needs? If not just sell it and move on.

hm7zb2j,Missykay88,11/26/2021,1,We never carried a balance. Ever. Ive never seen a single other card charge interest on purchases regardless of when you pay off the card. My citi card has never charged interest on anything and I pay it exactly the same as the credit one card. Grace period does not apply when the entire balance is paid long before even part of it was due. Like for the last statement month at the end of the statement period the balance was $0. Because I had already paid the card back to $0. But it still charged interest on all purchases made during that statement period.
hm848fp,billiarddaddy,11/26/2021,1,Check your state laws for [rent] checks uncashed he may not be entitled to that money anymore.  Edit: I expected downvotes.  > Personal Check and Check Writing  > A personal check is a document that orders the bank (in which you have an account) to pay out the sum specified on the check. It contains the drawer‚Äôs name their account number amount and the payee‚Äôs details. How long is a check valid? This type of check is valid for six months or 180 days after which you have to contact the bank and the drawer to extend the deadline.  [Source](https://www.checkissuing.com/blog/how-long-is-personal-check-good-for/)  This might be a legal question since each state probably has laws that govern whether or not hes entitled to that money after not cashing the check.
hm7nnad,FrostyMittenJob,11/26/2021,1,Thats not how Chase bill pay works. The moment you submit the payment they debit your account. The payment that is sent is made out of a completely different account
hm79m5p,Gunty1,11/26/2021,2,There is 4% of your salary being left on the table.  So he is wrong.   Bump it up and squirrel away to your savings to build up your emergency fund.  Run lean and suffer for a wee bit to make it happen easier to miss the money from the start than get used to the extra income and then try and dial back.
hm87g1s,PM_ME_YOUR_CALICOS,11/26/2021,1,Youre going to need an independent mechanic to take a look at it and do whats called a pre-purchase inspection. Do not pass go without this do not pass go if theres major issues and do not pass go just because the seller says hes taking care of it.  Other than that the car is worth significantly less. When you go to trade it in or sell it later no private party or dealer is going to be thrilled to see the salvage title. This isnt a concern if you keep it til it does or is worthless anyway.  A deer hit isnt the worst thing. Again just need an independent set of knowledgeable eyes on it.

I value having the extra space as opposed to an apartment but I will look into an equity fund as you suggested I know nothing about those!
hm79zpt,Heriros,11/26/2021,2,It depends when the landlord brought it to his attention. If the landlord is suddenly a year later saying he missed a rent payment thats on the landlord. If the payment was actually never received OP would have been getting rent statements for double the month after the payment was missed. Which would mean he was aware of the issue so itd be OP since he ignored it.
hm877md,Shacosclones,11/26/2021,1,Just a lpt: dont ever blindly trust anyone especially your parents. I know most people think that its good to because theyre your parent but be honest most of the time its a lazy easy out to looking into it yourself.  Now its fine to do but understand that going to 1 or 2 people about something means you can only hold them responsible and yourself.  Where as if you look into this stuff yourself you at least took an effort to not screw yourself over.
hm7wb5k,kidneysc,11/26/2021,1,OP says he only needs 20k for an efund and has 70k to work with.   Buy 20k over the next 60 days and continue to hold 20k in cash till they vest in 12 months.

I wouldnt hang up the phone until they could lay out next steps toward getting the issue resolved along with estimated timeframe for each of those steps.  And if they cant give you an answer or the timeframe isnt agreeable Id demand that someone write you a physical check.  Im pretty sure most every state has a department of labor that would handle issues like this.
hm6x3aw,colty31,11/26/2021,1,I imagine they will declare it totaled and give you a check for the current value of the car. Unfortunately since used car prices are insane right now that check you receive will probably not be enough money to go out and buy an equal replacement vehicle.
hm7gcek,Phillip_Jae_Fry,11/26/2021,1,No thats only if you were due a refund. In that case you have three years to file a return and claim it. If you actually owe taxes theres a late filing penalty for each month that its late in addition to the interest owed for each month the outstanding taxes were unpaid. If you have a good excuse for not filing you may be able to get that late filing fee waived (stuck in a third world country during the entire year due to Covid seems like itd work provided OP can back that up with proof).

If you can see your work space from every angle except your bedroom- it may feel like you are always ‚Äúon‚Äù  I have a big ole house now- I went from 750 sq ft to living in a 350 sq ft RV to about 3500 square feet home.   We have one entire room that we (first time home buyers) didn‚Äôt realize has no good real use. That square footage would have been much more useful in the laundry room / pantry.   Watch out for lifestyle creep- where you have more money so you buy more things because it‚Äôs more affordable.
hm8h8e9,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,You mean cars which go down in value making capital gains impossible?
hm7h5cj,PSYKO_Inc,11/26/2021,1,There are a lot of comments already and I havent read everything yet but a couple things have jumped out at me so far.  You always want to max your 401k match at the minimum. With that being said at 52k annual 6 percent is $3120/yr or $260/mo. The difference between contributing 3% and 6% is $130/mo. Actually a bit less than that since taxes would be deferred but I digress. Are you telling me that $130/mo is the difference between go/no-go in your budget?  If this is the case you have bigger problems to worry about. You are already at the ragged edge financially and need to seriously re-examine your budget. $130 is a simple common emergency like a flat tire or a power outage causing the food in the refrigerator to go bad. You should always leave a little extra in the budget for things like that so you arent dipping into savings (which is there for big emergencies like unemployment major home/car repairs etc.) for every little hiccup.  YOU MUST REDUCE EXPENSES! At 52k income figuring for ~20% deductions for federal/state/FICA/Medicare and another 6% for 401k you are left with about $3200/mo. If youre spending $3k youre stretching yourself too thin. Where can you make some room? If its a car payment sell the car and get something cheaper because you cant afford it. If its housing same thing. Move somewhere cheaper or get a roommate because you cant afford it. Food? Avoid restaurants cook for yourself. Saving $10 a day by bringing lunch to work instead of hitting the local lunch spots is an extra $300 a month in your pocket.   Its really easy to let small seemingly insignificant purchases add up. Use something like Mint to figure out what you are spending on determine if its a trend and adjust your habits accordingly.  I understand that my comments here may come off a little bit harsh and I dont want you to think Im calling you out on it Im just trying to give you the wake-up call that you may need to make some changes before you end up over your head.
hm74mvy,UtopianLibrary,11/26/2021,1,They‚Äôre looking for money laundering to make sure your down payment is legit. They might also be looking for proof of direct deposit paychecks.   Source:I used to no a loan processor.
hm7yfks,Majalen3,11/26/2021,1,GOEV options.  Buy them long and profit
hm8hotv,Err_rrr_rrrr,11/26/2021,1,Whats the best source to use to look at market prices?
hm8tt0i,john_dune,11/26/2021,36,Add to this branch manager face to face meeting situation. Dont let them throw it to a lackey.  This kind of action is something thats an insta-firing in any financial institution ive come across.
hm8fbjp,inly4udsm,11/26/2021,1,Just remember not only does he have your account info but also you‚Äôre Facebook account and more than likely your address. If he‚Äôs desperate enough to contact you who knows what he might do especially if fired. Be careful is all I‚Äôm saying.
hm8apy8,Gotanis55,11/26/2021,1,It seems to me that riding the wave doesnt seem to be an option given the situation (unless I want to give up the house Im in the process of purchasing). The reason Im selling is because I am using the money for the down payment on a house. It was a poor idea to make an offer on a house before having the down payment in cash but I didnt want to jump the gun in case my offer was rejected.  But thats the position Im in now in any case.   Basically the stocks are getting sold for time-sensitive reason completely unrelated to the market dipping. If I werent selling them to pay for the down payment Id just ride the wave (or better yet find some extra cash to buy more stocks now).    Unless Im missing an idea it seems like Im between either selling now as was the plan to begin with before things started to dip or hang on for a short amount of time (probably at most two weeks. I would need to sell the stocks and then wire cash into my bank account before the closing).
hm88209,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/26/2021,1,Thank you for your service.  If you can get a home where the monthly housing cost (principal + interest + insurance) is manageable long term it seems like a reasonable thing to do.  If you are allowed and you are open to it I wonder if you could rent out a room for some extra income.
hm8c9uk,Optimal-Amphibian,11/26/2021,1,I use Ally and landlord uses BoA.
hm8m73d,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,Its also important to realize that the LTV will have an impact on your interest rate.
hm7wt8x,cross_mod,11/26/2021,1,If you dont use the same bank then theres a wire fee I believe. So you set up an auto pay through your bank that creates a check and sends it out. Theres no fee for this. I did this with a couple of my bills.
hm899b5,CaptainNayak,11/26/2021,1,Yes of course :) that‚Äôs great. Thank you so much for the information! ü§ó
hm891jj,adoredactive,11/26/2021,1,That‚Äôs what‚Äôs confusing yes. I did finance 1 car and it‚Äôs been paid off for over a year now though. And it shows under ‚Äúclosed accounts‚Äù . And it‚Äôs name is credit acceptance. So I don‚Äôt understand this GMAC thing
hm7en7i,vrtigo1,11/26/2021,1,That seems like a really bad idea.  My understanding is that if you walk into a branch and get a cashiers check and then lose that check youre out the funds.  So wouldnt the same apply if the check they send gets lost in the mail?  Any idea why they do it this way vs just sending a normal check?
hm8dmon,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,Well for one this costs money whereas a check does not (for me in US). But secondly I am sure to write in the memo section of my check as cashing the check acts as an acceptance of those terms. Reasonably my landlords could claim I paid them $XXXX for something else. Would it be thrown out in court? Surely. But I rent from scumbags and I‚Äôd rather cover my ass with a check.
hm7dj9j,kmpdx,11/26/2021,1,Mistakes do happen like this. For example if for some reason a person needs to manually transcribe an account number and make a mistake on one digit that matches another account. This happened to me once.
hm7397q,islangmemes,11/26/2021,2,Vroom offered me the most for my car by a good bit and I sold it to them. Super seamless transaction. Definitely check the price of your car out there first before selling to the dealer.
hm7eyqv,x31b,11/26/2021,1,They ‚Äòcare‚Äô in that a visible scratch will take some of the value off the car. Maybe $500. Maybe $1000 if the door has to be replaced. But they have a shop and can get the work done cheaper than you. Unless you know what you‚Äôre doing just sell it to them.  As others have pointed out it‚Äôs a great time to sell a car right now. Bad time to have to buy one.  Edit: but in case it‚Äôs not clear in this market that would not stop them from buying it. They can look at it and know what it will cost to fix. Unlike an engine running rough or a transmission problem. Those they don‚Äôt know until they get into it whether it‚Äôs a $200 repair or a $4000 one.
hm6z40k,hopingtothrive,11/26/2021,1,You need to take your recovery seriously. Stay as long as you can and accept all the help offered.
hm88qnw,CaptainNayak,11/26/2021,1,That‚Äôs incredible! I was always under the impression I‚Äôd get some sort of credibility being an authorized user on her account but 800 is exceptional. Would this apply to when we buy a house together too?
hm6w31i,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,Do you think you will file taxes in America next year?
hm8416b,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,Technically I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äútrying‚Äù to do anything. I saw a house for a really good price and called my realtor friend. He said don‚Äôt go see it without getting pre approved. Gave me the number for the broker (I think that‚Äôs the right term) he deals with. That guy had me fill out an application online and came back with this information.  We didn‚Äôt get much into anything beyond the collections (I had target and another) because he knew I wasn‚Äôt really in a rush to buy or wanted to buy and he said it was best to get myself in a better credit position before trying to buy. I believe he was going to do it for a first time buyer loan - if that helps.
hm7kzhz,InaMellophoneMood,11/26/2021,1,For how venerated the dude is in conservative circles hes a real piece of work that fucked over so many people
hm8fywu,Featherfy,11/26/2021,1,Are you absolutely sure it is that same teller? Gonna play small devils advocate re: social engineering in case its a fake account of someone who learned about the teller and maybe knows youre banking with that institution.   But. Given the timing I doubt it and it sounds like its the actual teller.  Either way you need to tell the bank.
hm8lkvp,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,Ahh thats great then.  In your original statement you didnt mention that you already had the 55k for the house.  Interest rates will only go up from here and the recent upward trend hasnt really impacted prices due to inventory shortages.  If I was looking for a home I wouldnt wait too long.  Once you get ready to prequalify ask to see the numbers between 10% down and the smallest down you can use.  Compare to expected investment returns to the increased cost and see if the numbers work for you.  Even with PMI it was better for me to invest than put a larger down.
hm7gb2m,Brandon432,11/26/2021,1,Bill pay relives funds from your account when ythr check is written.
hm7gnov,shadow1515,11/26/2021,1,I wish all my auto bill pays would work that way. Verizon sends a thank you email for my auto payment on the day it is scheduled but then doesnt actually take it out of my account for like 6 more days. Its fine since its always the same day so I am accounting for it but its still annoying it takes that long because I like to check all my boxes and as far as Im concerned a bill paid is not a box checked until the money is gone.
hm7lod4,benj_frito,11/26/2021,1,Didnt know that thank you!
hm7exm1,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,Start budgeting and saving for maintenance and repairs.  Shop for cheaper insurance every now and then. Dont just stick to the same one every year without shopping.
hm7yvhu,iSOBigD,11/26/2021,1,You can generally do all this online.  If you make a check out to someone provide it to them and the money leaves your account youve done your part its not up to you to prove anything more
hm8dmp7,Independent-Self-854,11/26/2021,1,It‚Äôs messed up because loss on a car is not tax deductible.  But yes it is a capital gain.   However depending on your tax bracket you may not actually owe any taxes.  If you are single and you make less than 40k then the amount of capital gains that gets you to 40 is not taxed. Think about putting that money into a retirement account to reduce your taxable income.
hm7rj0g,NelsonCatMan,11/26/2021,1,Fair market price isnt a set price it changes with the market.
hm8j7hc,Annahsbananas,11/26/2021,1,No. Dont reply to the message. Immediately get a screenshot. And go on person to the bank head manager first thing on Monday morning
hm86c3a,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,Thought that was for people with jobs? Because you have to use income to fund it. My money does not count as income. It‚Äôs not taxed.
hm7qnxt,93195,11/26/2021,1,Nope.  ‚ÄúI sure wish I didn‚Äôt have this much money in retirement.‚Äù  Said no retiree ever.
hm6yn4h,NeighborhoodNo3050,11/26/2021,1,Can you refinance at any point. Did you do it?
hm75koq,ratptrl01,11/26/2021,1,Navy or Air Force they offer the best employment opportunities after serving. Anything in electronics intelligence if you can get on a sub and learn that shit... I went to school for engineering and they tried recruiting me to be an engineer on a sub. I was like holy shit I dont think so lol. But the pay was insane they obviously value those things greatly and I imagine if you got a job inside a submarine that it would be a pretty good opportunity. Navy and electronics and radar all that shit is vitally important on a ship. I had considered the Navy for that very reason. This was 10 years ago though. No telling if the game has changed now.
hm6ww7u,skinnedalmond,11/26/2021,2,He‚Äôs worked there since 1988 and if he retired in 2023 he‚Äôd get 4480 each month pretax. I think he makes 6200/month now.   We were a family of 8 and when we were growing up he didn‚Äôt make as much so it was stretched thin. We also have monetary obligations to family who lived abroad
hm7h86i,zerogee616,11/26/2021,1,I think its less about altruism and more him letting the guy go with a good reference in favor of someone who will (on paper) reliably be able to make rent every month is the lesser evil than not knowing if OP can make the rent and possibly having to forcibly evict a tenant for both parties. If I was a landlord Id replace him. Besides the UK housing market is tight enough OPs landlord should be able to find a replacement tenant pretty quick.
hm7cidz,rallyally,11/26/2021,1,Yes this is true however I was able to see that a direct deposit was attempted on the first two week pay cycle so that‚Äôs the issue. Thank you though
hm6x4tn,noodle-face,11/26/2021,2,For stuff like Christmas spending I wouldnt worry. If anything theyll flag certain transactions and ask for you to provide an explanation.
hm7k37v,reality_junkie_xo,11/26/2021,1,I always buy new for peace of mind that the car has been treated well. Financing is usually much better for new cars (my current car is at 0%) and for risk-averse people like me you can buy an extended warranty so you don‚Äôt have any unexpected repair bills for 7-8 years.
hm7nrb2,cross_mod,11/26/2021,2,I slightly suspect that the landlord got an envelope from Chase thought it was junk mail and chucked it.
hm8f1sh,Cejvo7,11/26/2021,1,Oh gotcha. So should I just keep putting into it every month?
hm8jma2,grimmowl,11/26/2021,1,so for me that would be a conflict right. On one hand the home value is good and an asset to consider capitalizing on ...the other hand is can u find a cheaper area to live (and house yourself) in. None of what im thinking about is factoring in personal life decisions.  worst case you are housed rent free which in itself is something
hm7sv8d,reddituserfromDE,11/26/2021,1, If you truly want to serve in the military than go for it.   But dont do it for financial reasons.  Get some training in the trades. HVAC auto mechanic carpentry etc....  .    Mike Rowes organization gives out scholarships.   https://www.mikeroweworks.org/
hm6y4bw,No-Garlic-1739,11/26/2021,1,Yup I understand why this happens from an operations perspective but its just wild that you can work for 4 weeks before getting paid. It just feels odd.
hm8ifwd,crypto_boner,11/26/2021,1,Nope. You can invest in any states plan.  We invested in Illinois Bright Start or whatever for years when we lived there and took advantage of the tax credit for IL. We moved to MA and opened a plan here. I keep the old one open or else I have to pay back the tax credits.  So we have IL and MA 529 plans and were getting tax credits for the MA plan now.  Our children are not bound to attend school in either of those states.
hm8anbz,Fishtale1,11/26/2021,1,Yeah this is just a guy that buys them from insurance company and fixes them then resells them. Pretty sure the airbags were deployed. But I have the cash so wont need any financing

hm798iw,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,24,Me? Id get my emergency fund in order with a quickness before maxing out retirement matching. As for student loans thats a math problem. % paid over time vs expected return made over time. (Note expected isnt a promise and investment carries risk of loss). Dad may equate loan debt with burden and risk. So if you decide differently than dad explain youre reasoning and then ask his feedback on your reasoning.   We old folk have lived through some weird financial times. It tends to instruct our choices.   On a personal note I judge the rhetoric to be a wee bit on the harsh side... things like stupid/dumb or who to believe. People can disagree on the value of something and it not be dumb or about right vs wrong or who to believe.  The truth is all investing is an educated guess as to predicting the future outcome of value. But only YOU can decide the value of peace of mind and what I call the value of the hassle.  Your dad and your friends can both be correctly describing your choices. But they are your choices. And in case you need it you have permission to not be perfect and maximize every penny every time. Make the best choices YOU can comfortably live with. Me? I had two choices risking not making as much as I could or risking not being able to keep and enjoy what I had and start over. Well starting over was and is way too much hassle for me. I enjoy predictable and calm in my world. So I made sure I had security first. 30 years later (yep Im old) we own our little business house and cars outright with zero debt. Its not fancy but its ours. And when life decided to life all over us we survived and were able to help our loved ones survive too. For me that was the right choice. For others? Not so much Im sure. Moral of my story? You choose what can and cant risk losing. Then go from there. If you can tolerate losing out on max profit youll find there are more choices than you can imagine. If you cant tolerate starting over from scratch  well then you have less choices too. The one thing Ill tell you not to risk certainly not over money is a good relationship with your dad. Thats priceless.
hm745oz,LOTEZK,11/26/2021,5,Just swallow your pride and do it. You would change the course of your life significantly.
hm78izs,SeegsonSynthetics,11/26/2021,2,Seconding this.  More responsibilities but it‚Äôs a better quality of life than enlisted.
hm82tgj,ForeverALone_Ranger,11/26/2021,1,Thanks I appreciate it.
hm786bm,inkheart58,11/26/2021,1,Anyone tried Pocketsmith?
hm6zakr,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,Yep exactly! Its crossed my mind that I could technically just turn my back on the debt but I dont want to do that partly because Im not out to steal money but mostly because I would like to return to the US. The US is more my home than Ireland the standard of living is so much higher and I can earn far more year on year (but will earn even more on the new career track than I would have as an office manager)
hm7l7kl,hnw555,11/26/2021,1,Thats not true for autopay. The money is debited when the check is sent by the bank. If you write a check and mail it it doesnt come out until its cashed.
hm8f77j,brittyn,11/26/2021,1,Yikes. I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre so hesitant to report this ASAP. Is it a major bank?
hm8b3n5,brawlrats,11/26/2021,1,He must have earned income to fund an IRA so that‚Äôs likely a no-go.
hm87sle,kdfn,11/26/2021,1,Idk seems like a large amount of effort and risk for only 6k in profit each year. Do you expect the home to appreciate in value significantly based on long-term historical trends in the area? Having PMI paid for is obviously a huge perk although at these levels the cost isnt super high anyway.
hm87r2h,93195,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôd personally give it about half a day to see if it bounces back a little.  If not time to sell.
hm81hul,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,Gotcha we sure are! Thank you for clarifying. This is definitely the way to do it IMO.
hm8j9bb,ImAjustin,11/26/2021,1,Usually you can access the virtual assistants online. I‚Äôd start there to see if they can freeze the account
hm793pc,Slimysalaman,11/26/2021,1,Chase freedom unlimited is a great all around card and I was sent an offer that had 5% back on groceries for the first year. Amex Blue Cash everyday is also a strong contender if you havent looked into it. My Sapphire Preferred had an intro offer valued at $1600 so it essentially pays for itself for many years if you budget towards travel anyway.
hm6vdrh,Buddy_Jare,11/26/2021,7,Yeah that definitely doesn‚Äôt sound right. Someone with a pension like that doesn‚Äôt live paycheque to paycheque while working or during retirement.
hm6snbb,whatsmynamema,11/26/2021,1,running is my backbone if I didnt do that I couldnt do anything. that probably sounds crazy but its true its transformed my life really.   Maybe I should lessen the intensity of the workouts instead
hm7eexv,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,13% is ludicrous as well as the 6% you may want to look into re-finance. Also what probably happened is that the majority of the money from your payments went to cover the interest rather than the principal (the amount you owe). Look at a detail view of the payments and you will be able to see the distribution.
hm85vfd,Lone_Vagrant,11/26/2021,1,1.5k savings for 3k monthly expenditure?   Dude. Listen to your dad and build up your safety net first. Bare minimum is like 3 months worth. But I would recommend up to 6 months.   1.5k savings pretty much means you are living paycheck to paycheck. Because the moment you lose your pay or your pay gets delayed. You are fucked. Or if something come up and you need to cough out more than 1.5k well you wont be able too until your next paycheck.
hm8o7zg,catdude142,11/26/2021,1,Dont call them.  Appear in person and ask to see the bank manager.
hm75bjs,OperaticIguana,11/26/2021,2,Well you said **ever find** not reasonable.  You can complain to your benefits coordinator about the high expense ratios.  Im not aware of any downsides to in-service withdrawal.

hm8redh,cricketsymphony,11/26/2021,1,Unfortunately no 401k so Ill be contributing after tax money.   Based on everyones feedback Ill definitely be setting up a Roth this year.
hm7dn8t,pr0t3us,11/26/2021,1,You should be fine. IIRC you get up to 3 years to file without penalty so you should be fine. They just likely have an estimation already done based on history of you dont usually owe there probably wont be any fees attached. Ive missed before and they just waived any fees when I called in.
hm779rf,ocast03,11/26/2021,2,I think it is sound advice if you only have $1500 in savings but have $3000 per month in expenses.
hm70kb5,rnelsonee,11/26/2021,1,Im not retired yet but my plan is to sell and withdraw a few times a year. And Id keep an eye on taxes - like Id probably hold off on withdrawing 401k money that would put me in the 22% bracket if I can keep my spending below that on average.
hm84qb0,Skootchy,11/26/2021,1,Fortune 500 company. Im not going to say who they were but they were the largest corporation in their industry not even close in comparison.   It was total bullshit. It pissed me off more because I knew they could pay it and I definitely made some calls to the local district office....but I also wanted to keep my job.   It was also a very political company. They ended up being complete garbage to me and I left.

hm7hljo,NoMoLerking,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôm not exactly sure how you get on the list but there are apartment communities that are only for the elderly and those with disabilities. My friends grandma lived in [this place](https://www.corcoranapts.com/communities/massachusetts/andover/andover-commons/) years ago. It‚Äôs definitely no-frills but clean and safe. Commuter rail across the street supermarket next door. You basically pay 1/4 (1/3?) of your income for a 1 bedroom apartment.
hm7ghfy,brettick,11/26/2021,1,3% of a 52k salary is only about $130/mo more deducted from your pay. Will that make such a big difference in how long it takes you to save up an EF?

hm7bgcn,kilzfillz,11/26/2021,1,Ok cool so I‚Äôm on the right track. Thank you
hm8cf2m,last-resort-4-a-gf,11/26/2021,1,Does the title say rebuilt ?   In Canada a salvaged car could be fixed and then get titled as rebuilt . Otherwise you cant get insurance
hm72s6n,technologite,11/26/2021,1,Thats absolutely unreal.  Ive had this happen to me a couple times.  One time I had an actual physical check within a couple hours.   The second time...  I had a pending deposit within an hour and it cleared overnight and a promise that any/all fees that I incur would be covered by the company.  Payroll checks are handled differently than all other checks.  Theres 0 excuses besides gross negligence why you wouldnt get paid from a legitimate corporation for 2 weeks.
hm83mrl,93195,11/26/2021,1,You report it all as 2021 income filed in 2022.

hm8ako8,Morepaperplease,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôm addicted!!  I can‚Äôt stop.  I‚Äôm there. It‚Äôs not a large gap if I don‚Äôt contribute but then I lose the free 4% from the Company.  In their mind they use that as pay leverage so why let them keep it.  I could dial back but it‚Äôs fun at this point.  Plus maxing out a 401k Roth and standard 401k contribution is a goal!    I am riding the wave at this point!
hm6wsg4,colty31,11/26/2021,1,GAP is irrelevant here
hm6uhbi,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,2,> But my understanding is that currently I am trying to roll over my traditional 401k to a traditional IRA.  Read the links before you do this.  Pay attention to Screwup #5.
hm859tw,CaptainSeattle1965,11/26/2021,1,Why would with or without a down payment matter if the applicant has a charge off?
hm6vtff,rallyally,11/26/2021,1,Sadly there was only one person in the physical HR office who had no idea about anything. Short staffed + work at home = not a good HR at all (but especially to try to physically go there) üòï
hm8l3r5,carolineecouture,11/26/2021,1,You might want to also consider that this is some kind of scam. This may not actually be the teller or even someone from the bank but someone pretending to be from the bank. In any case if its actually the teller or someone trying to scam you it needs to be reported to the bank immediately. I agree with the others in the thread that this needs to be taken seriously. If its the teller its a serious breach of professional behavior if its not and its a scam that is even more worrying. Good luck OP. I hope you and your money are OK.
hm6uqtx,snny_all_year,11/26/2021,2,Yes it began mandatory for new Service Members in 2018 and those who were under 12 years at the time had a choice to opt-in.   Its an automatic 1% contribution and then the service member can gain an additional 4% in matching funds if they contribute 5%. They also added in a defined continuation pay (lump sum like a reenlistment bonus) to be paid out between 8-12 years as a retention incentive.    The downside is that the retirement multiplier goes from 2.5% for every year served to 2%. So if you retire at 20 years you only get 40% of your high 3 instead of 50%. OTOH many service members do not make it to 20 and fail to save properly in their early years because they had planned to do 20. This way they walk away with SOMETHING regardless of how long they served. I think its overall a good change.
hm82aop,ajeebith,11/26/2021,1,You will have to transfer your policy to your current apartment or get a new policy. But doing either doesnt cover you for ‚Äúsomething that happened in your apartment‚Äù. For all practical purposes you are currently uninsured. Period.
hm8cbto,SwAeromotion,11/26/2021,1,This is where you report that teller to the local branch.
hm8gvse,trmoore87,11/26/2021,1,Following to see responses. We are in a similar situation. My wife just graduated and just started her job so she will only be working 2 months this year. But we will be over the MFJ Roth IRA threshold next year so we would only be able to contribute this year.
hm7y2qz,MydogisaToelicker,11/26/2021,1,Yes.  While I cant say for sure for your situation with the temporary new benefits on next years taxes it has switched and is now usually more beneficial to get the tax credit.
hm81qqv,nattyay,11/26/2021,1,This helps a ton thank you. Ive got full coverage over my car so should I call my insurance provider after the offender is apprehended in case they DO have insurance and were just drunk driving?
hm82ycu,th3wheel,11/26/2021,1,No brainer here.  The opportunity to grow to be less exhausted and to have less stress is not to be trifled with.
hm7qh41,93195,11/26/2021,1,Out of pocket.  Your savings account interest rate (<0.5%) probably isn‚Äôt substantially different than a deferred interest rate (0%).  For $1800 just pay it and be done with it.
hm6xglj,skinnedalmond,11/26/2021,2,Thanks for your input!
hm7ql81,wild_b_cat,11/26/2021,1,The problem is what you do with your money once you stop saving as much for retirement. If you start spending it your lifestyle will get more expensive and youll have that much harder a time getting by in retirement. Dont make overly optimistic assumptions about getting by on a thin budget then just because you think you can now.  And thats before you factor in 30 years of inflation.  The coast concept is perfectly legit but it usually implies making big lifestyle changes now like taking a low-paying job just to tide you over until retirement. Its not a matter of just shutting off the 401k deferrals at 35 and cashing in at 65.
hm85nph,Ok_Anteater_7446,11/26/2021,1,If you are feeling burnt out with no light at the end of the tunnel and you dont have any drastic changes that will make it more difficult I say go for it.  If the market is hot in your area and you think you can get more elsewhere you can always stay where you are until you find something better. It all depends on your level of burnout and how comfortable you are with waiting it out. I made a similar move to what youre considering and am happy I did it but Id gotten to a point where I wanted to call in sick every day. You may not feel the same if you still feel comfortable.
hm6wums,Gavilan_y_Paloma,11/26/2021,1,Thank you for your help!
hm76bwq,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,2,Happens all the time. Usually a spouse accidentally or purposely keeps using and paying on the card. Banks eventually figure it out and we close the account.  Banks have the ability to go after the living parties if they so choose.
hm8i7y5,Chinpokomaster05,11/26/2021,1,That lifestyle creep will be hard to deal with later on when youre back to a likely lower budget in retirement (as others mentioned).   I had coastFIRE in mind but thats so one can dramatically slow down saving for retirement and focus on paying off a house in a HCOL location.
hm7fggy,JellyDenizen,11/26/2021,1,Whats the interest rate on your mortgage?  If its 3% or something like that then spending extra money to pay down the mortgage probably wouldnt be as good as investing it.  Other than that just save for maintenance expenses and fix things sooner rather than later.
hm7r3mt,shadow_chance,11/26/2021,1,Thats whats being *withheld* from your paychecks. Which may or may not be your actual tax liability. Line 24 on your 1040 will show your actual federal income tax liability. If your income in 2020 was similar to this year (and you didnt have any other big changes) that will give you a reasonable idea of what you owe.
hm6xbg0,Bort_Bortson,11/26/2021,2,Cash is whatever portion you didnt buy back as a Roth which is what you are going to hold onto to pay the taxes associated with the conversion.  Ignoring all other income right 10% rate assumption for example only. 9000 in IRA sold 9000 to cash account or direct to you. 8100 of funds bought into ROTH. 900 kept in savings or cash account based on estimated tax burden. 900 sent to IRS to cover amount owed when filing taxes.  Yes it is taxable. Youll receive a form in a few months that you file with your tax returns saying you sold a 9k IRA and that 9k is considered taxible income.  Obviously depending on how everything else shakes out you may need more or less when your actual tax amount is figured out. Hopefully your refund will cancel out most or all of the conversion tax so you can decide to do something with whatever you kept on hand. Its not like sales tax thats calculated at the point of conversion if that makes sense.
hm8jcml,Jeabers,11/26/2021,1,He probably has access to all of them (I used to be a bank teller). I would report him to the branch manager and switch banks immediately. Extremely unprofessional.
hm862wd,trekologer,11/26/2021,1,Or it wasnt cashed. Now the question is whether Chase actually sent the check it was sent but lost in the mail or the landlord received it but never cashed it.   Id be suspicious that the landlord was just noticing now a year later that they didnt receive the rent payment for a month. Maybe theyre just bad at record keeping but if theyre that bad that they didnt notice not getting a rent check a year later theyre just as likely to have received the check and lost it.
hm8tu0o,ejohnson33,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôd use the cash to pay your debts then rent with a nice emergency fund in your back pocket. You‚Äôll then learn how to budget and invest monthly for the down payment later on.
hm7hgzb,Lollc,11/26/2021,1,Since your dad has proven he knows whats going on with finance hes not dumb.  He sees you have interest bearing debt and dont even have enough savings to pay a months rent.  That is a bad place to be.  And Im sure he knows because hes seen how easy it is to acquire debt when you are just starting out.  There are many posts to this subreddit by people with high 5 figure debt and they all got the debt when they were first starting out.  Dad is also trying to protect himself.  He wants you to have a successful adult life without having to bail you out.  You have more time than he does to build savings.
hm6t3g4,continue_improve,11/26/2021,1,I agree rebalancing this year is a good strategy given your higher future salary. In your situation you will end up paying 15% so I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much game you can play.   There‚Äôs a chart on optimal sequencing of investment here somewhere. I‚Äôm sure someone will be able to point you to it. But typically you first make sure you get full match from 401k then max out Roth IRA then max out 401k and then taxable brokerage.
hm7su1a,DLSR_Travler,11/26/2021,1,How do you do it?
hm7xu0b,nevermidit,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for the answer. But surely theres a cost of sending the letter the stamp? I guess its cheaper then wire fee?
hm7thiq,German_Not_German,11/26/2021,1,Built the e fund first. You can always switch your contribution amount to the 401k later.  Less than a months worth of expenses in reserve is scary.
hm8k9ia,FNSlick,11/26/2021,1,Report this to the bank manager. This is absolutely outside any kind of ethical boundaries the tellers and employees of a bank have. Fuck that teller and report this shit.  This is how people get followed home and robbed.
hm772tw,jaraldoe,11/26/2021,6,To tack onto this comment (highly underrated btw coming from someone in the Air Force)   Don‚Äôt commit to just one branch ‚Äúshop around‚Äù and see what each offers. Each have their own up‚Äôs and downs and it‚Äôs important to find those out from someone who ISN‚ÄôT a recruiter. Rarely will a recruiter talk about the shitty stuff that you have to deal with in that branch. (For instance where I‚Äôm stationed we have every branch and Marines are treated the worst by a large margin with the strictest rules and worst punishments)  Also Guard/Reserve are also hidden gems. Seriously look into the guard/reserve everyone I work with (Air Force Pilots) wish we had done the guard gig.
hm8h6k2,Cruian,11/26/2021,1,>So my question is does it make sense for me to open a Roth and contribute $6k this year?  Everything helps. Though Traditional might be better if you can get the full benefit from it.  >Or should I keep everything simple and open an IRA which I can keep contributing to until retirement?  Your work doesnt provide a 401K or other employer plan? If so your income is too high to get the full benefits from Traditional IRAs.
hm870ps,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs based off how much the asset is worth.
hm870wi,Aleyla,11/26/2021,1,If OP has a down payment then they have money to pay the $1800.         If they don‚Äôt have a down payment then they are likely going to have other issues buying and / or affording a house. A house can have rather large and unexpected expenses. If OP can‚Äôt afford the $1800 to pay off this credit card then they sure aren‚Äôt going to be able to pay for an air conditioner if that goes out.   Paying for a house is very different than renting.
hm7cvbr,blakeeli12,11/26/2021,1,I would look at all branches. If you are looking for the most comfortable living situation I would go air force. They get paid for things other branches do not like getting a bonus because your barracks isn‚Äôt nice enough. I did five years in the navy as a corpsman and I never touched a ship so do not let the idea of being at sea deter you.   While it can suck at times you will mot only build the strongest friendships ever but the Post 911 GI bill is nice. Not only is the government covering my tuition to become a pilot but they also pay me a housing allowance of $1500 a month.   Conclusion- If you want to go to school cost free and have are looking for a bachelors or higher then I would look into all of the branches.
hm7foa4,sab3192,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for the heads up I think one of the months I had high utilization but the rest have been around or under 30%. Ill try to keep at least the next 2 months really low then.
hm7hkpd,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,My personal rule is save first and pay later ( If I start to hit my savings for payments then I need to take a look at what I am spending and remediate it). These are my percentages... since I am not self employed I put 6% of my pretax salary to my employer since thats how much they match. 30% of my after tax salary goes to the Roth IRA (max amount) and the rest in investments. My personal emergency fund is 75% of what I make after tax. Whatever is left is put in a separate account as play money for any investment opportunities should arise (stocks properties etc...)
hm8ncdt,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,You are correct.  I missed that part.  OP owes capital gains tax on $4950.  If they make less then about 40k though the tax rate will be 0% if they make more it will be more like 15%.
hm83bie,elpierce6,11/26/2021,1,This was so great thanks for this from a random bystander.
hm8afr9,naanplussed,11/26/2021,1,Your balance decreases? That‚Äôs a debit.
hm79fd4,Quack_Shot,11/26/2021,1,Just gotta ask your employer we won‚Äôt know here what happened they may have mixed your hours with someone else. Very easy for that to happen since it‚Äôs just data entry. Compare the hours on your paycheck for that pay period with your time card for that pay period.
hm78qr3,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,2,I feel like you may have the wrong impression. Im curious which bank this is but they can close your account at any time. Just because you filed a complaint doesnt mean its going to change anything.
hm6sp0x,AlternativePhoto3799,11/26/2021,1,Who cares how or why he has the $750k? He didn‚Äôt ask people to jealously try to figure out how he saved it? He‚Äôs asking should he pay cash buying a house.  My individual vote is yes you should. I did very similar at approx 1/2 the amount in 2017‚Ä¶ I later chose to refinance or as they put it cash out some of my equity (just over $50k) at 1.9% - I had mortgages when prime rate was above 10% so this was nice‚Ä¶ for my individual albeit somewhat similar situation (single income etc..) fyi I own a small chain of stores & my salary/what I pay myself via payroll alongside my employees is $85k my net worth is higher than that- significantly higher so just because someone makes $80k a year in no way means they can‚Äôt save or have access to vastly more just like or similar to myself & my situation but it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business unless a valid need to know exists or I choose to disclose which I learned long ago definitely don‚Äôt ever do that lol  The answer to this question is completely dependent on so many unknown factors getting a proper answer is impossible because it is completely based on your individual situation what your future plans are I mean it‚Äôs endless there‚Äôs not enough information here to give you an accurate answer other than a general one which is you can never go wrong buying real estate if you‚Äôre going to hold onto it. So regardless history proves doing so and paying cash for a home is one of the safest investments you can make and the money will definitely grow and survive even market collapses etc. as long as you don‚Äôt have liens placed against it or are able to pay the taxes etc.
hm71hzn,NELA_21,11/26/2021,2,What was the investment?
hm7bvqj,fepaz0024,11/26/2021,1,This was what I thought as well. The rep who gave me that info DID check with a manager to ensure she was giving me accurate info so... one would hope it would be accurate. I did pull the T&Cs right now online. Unfortunately its called the IMPORTANT terms and conditions. Its only 7 pages and while it does say my mom would be responsible for my charges on a day to day basis it does not address death. Apparently the fully T&Cs are sent with the card so of course my mom would have thrown those out a few weeks ago. Im going to call up and get myself off this card. SMH  Im trying to NOT have access to credit (except a mortgage). If I dont have the money for it I dont buy it and I certainly dont want my mom buying things for me.
hm73usj,itpro71,11/26/2021,3,Retired at 59 I usually withdraw a month worth at a time.
hm84p18,wickedkittylitter,11/26/2021,1,Youd have $2600 left each month for all other expenses.  Only you can determine whether $2600 is enough.  Youre being aggressive with your savings/investments.  You can always cut back on the ESPP a bit.
hm7zgu2,Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo,11/26/2021,1,It depends on the loan type and your employment situation. Typically 60 days. 1099 or self employed borrowers will be longer. If you do not need assets to close it could be none.
hm74tv0,PapaKraken,11/26/2021,4,Chase or its bill pay surrogate should be able to trace the check that was sent and determine the deposit status.  The fact that you have gone thru 4 unwilling Chase employees is most annoying.   Your trump cards are to report the incident to the CFPB or to your states Attorney General.   They both will have oversite and move the issue to someone with authority.   Even the threat of this should get a bank manager motivated.  You want the image of the front and back of the check or an ACH number.
hm83xga,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,A car isn‚Äôt an asset. Why would it be liable for capital gains taxes?
hm842gd,nattyay,11/26/2021,1,Thanks a ton all this advice has been teaching me a ton about this stuff I knew nothing about. Will be contacting them asap
hm6v7p9,iamjerky,11/26/2021,12,Legitimately add their income to the mom‚Äôs checking account through a trust so you can legitimately pay their expenses out of the ssi benefits. AND have mom direct deposit a similar amount to an account that can fund the 529s. My mother was the trustee for an account and they were able to effectively shield this kid‚Äôs money for 20 years and he was able to attend school with money leftover for a large down payment on his first house. I would hire a tax lawyer a cpa and a financial advisor who is paid by the hour ONLY.
hm8ljlp,lemmecheckit,11/26/2021,1,Just sell it they will never figure it out. The sales tax will be harder to get out of. In the old days youd sell it for cash and write a receipt for a smaller amount.
hm7qzen,dps509,11/26/2021,1,That‚Äôs what I had thought in regards to the balance being transferred from the old bank/cc. I thought it was no difference in their eyes as receiving a payoff.   As for the latter I‚Äôm not sure. Certainly worth asking.
hm8728f,QuitProfessional5437,11/26/2021,1,Just leave after you fill out your Fafsa. You can fill out out starting 1/1/22
hm86m6g,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,Can you tell me why? Would you do 300 VTSAX and 100 VTIAX?   I think I can only do VTI unless I buy a whole share of VTSAX now that I think about it.
hm7113l,finance_n_fitness,11/26/2021,2,You can get a second job or you can move or find a roommate if you have the space. You won‚Äôt be able to sustain living that way.

hm7kfqi,oledawgnew,11/26/2021,1,What is the opportunity cost of investing--in other words what would you be doing with the money if you werent investing it?  As long as youre meeting required expenses and living what you consider a comfortable financial lifestyle I see no problem with saving/investing the remaining. You can always cut back to meet goals as they arrive in the future but if I were in your shoes I would not cut back on investing just for the sake of cutting back.
hm76xes,MightyEighth,11/26/2021,2,Join the Air Force OP you don‚Äôt have to sign for a job at MEPS (medical processing) like the army (you can wait until your preferred job comes open) and it‚Äôs better on you physically. I recommend something in intelligence civil engineering or some sort of administrative job.
hm86ad8,sirzoop,11/26/2021,1,He bought it for $50 and sold it for $5000. He made $4500 in capital gains and has to pay taxes on it.
hm71d5x,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,Thanks yep I guess I dont really have much of a choice. I feel like a goon for getting myself into this situation but it seemed like a good opportunity to get this degree under my belt and just deal with the financial mess later. Only time will tell whether I made a wise gamble or a silly mistake
hm8chb3,money_mase19,11/26/2021,1,Yes it‚Äôs an option for school to pay a bit but idk if I can handle my current job AND school. So if I just pay and do school full time I can focus on just school
hm7aguv,rnelsonee,11/26/2021,1,Yup 1 exemption then. And generally youd want more withheld to account for un-withheld income: think interest dividends gambling winnings (below a certain amount) capital gains etc. So if you had $1000 in other ordinary income (capital gains tax is different thats at a lower rate) thats $42.50 in extra taxes. So youd put in $43/26 into that box.  That and other people just like ensuring they get a refund. Thinking its better to throw an extra $20 per paycheck to give them a $520 refund in case there is other income or they made a mistake with deductions or something.

hm7uzzm,OnlyOne_X_Chromosome,11/26/2021,1,You do not get those benefits in school anymore. Reagan ended that.   Not trying to pile on here but maybe avoid specifics if you arent sure. Because thats twice now you have said things that arent true or at least arent true anymore. So maybe instead of your original comment you could have just said check with an attorney I had an experience that is different from what everyone is reporting.   And instead of telling that guy he is probably right (when he is wrong those benefits dont exist anymore) maybe you could have just admitted that you were unsure. Saying to talk to an attorney at the beginning or end doesnt really excuse giving out bad info.   Again not trying to pile on you seemed like you were genuinely trying to help I am doing the same so I hope my comment is taken in the same fashion.
hm6xk13,1hotjava,11/26/2021,3,Read the FAQ on here lots of good investment advice. If you have questions after reading please ask away.   (I post this reply because we get this question multiple times a day FYI. Lots of reading on here)
hm8dbhz,Bduken_2190,11/26/2021,1,You have to start reporting your income. Even direct money lenders want to see prior year tax returns. I know business owners who file their taxes but write everything off and can‚Äôt get a loan because they show a net zero income.   Your can add her as an authorized user without giving her a card and it will help but she needs to be claiming her income as well.
hm6uel6,PetraLoseIt,11/26/2021,7,When you want to pay off debts or want to free up more money to save you basically have two options:   1. Spend less 2. Earn more  Given how you already are working 45 hours per week Id lean towards you starting to spend less.   So I want to ask you: what is your current income like and what are you spending money on? Do you have an overview of what you spent in say the last month? Look at that overview and see whether its possible to start spending less - which would first free up money to pay off debt and later free up money to save to avoid going back into debt.   As for the debts: it can help to pay them off from highest interest rate to lowest. So you pay the required minimum amounts on all debts and then beyond that you put any extra money towards the debt with the highest interest rate.   You can learn to be better at understanding and handling money. Just as youve worked on your running skills and programming skills. It might help to learn some more about personal finance could be through books or youtube or podcasts...
hm8n12q,Sajomir,11/26/2021,1,Something may happen in the future that prevents you from saving as much. Major bill taking in a family member sudden child (adopted or otherwise).  Nothing wrong with staying ahead of the game while you can.
hm7vjzd,CQME,11/26/2021,1,I bought a new SUV a couple months ago.  Someone totaled the car I was in while I was on vacation and I needed a car ASAP to get back home.  Had a rental for 7 days.  Within 2 days I found the vehicle I was looking for 300 miles away from my location.  They only had one and it was the color and model I was looking for.  It sold close to the low end of MSRP.  I used Sams Clubs auto buying service to find the vehicle.  I drove there test drove the vehicle and drove off the lot 2 hours later.  I just checked Sams Club just now for the same vehicle.  I can find vehicles that are about 5% more expensive nowhere near what youre experiencing.  Maybe try getting a Sams Club membership.
hm7foyo,robertoblake2,11/26/2021,1,Its like 3.25% or something like that. I do have a warranty? How much should I set aside for maintenance? And if I can max out my SEP-IRA and still pay down the mortgage should I do that rather than investing in a non-tax advantaged account?     Thanks!
hm7bo20,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,Oh. Seems times are changing. Ill keep an eye out for this at my bank.

hm70p4w,rowrowrowurbutt,11/26/2021,2,This whole situation is a giant mess and Im doing the best I can to keep my sisters bills paid. Sis lived with mom so mom paid their rent which was all above board and reported to SS.  Now mom is gone but sis cant afford the rent. She doesnt have the faculties to navigate finding a new place. Shes also an incredibly difficult spiteful person which has caused us to become estranged. But out of duty to mom Im still trying to help her live independently in the same situation she had prior to moms death.  When we learned that the inheritance might affect her SSI Id asked her to simply disinherit the money so it could then go to me as secondary beneficiary and I could use it to pay her rent and bills just like mom was doing. Again which SS would know about. If she inherits the money and loses SSI she can afford to live on the inheritance for maybe a year given her medical bills and medication copays. Then since it was mom who helped her file for SSI in the first place shed probably refuse to file for herself and end up on the street.  Since she refuses to handle any of this even something as simple as calling the insurance company Im trying to find a way to do it. Ill take into consideration that its important to avoid fraudulent behaviors thank you for bringing it up.  If you have any advice for how to handle the situation better please share it. The whole thing has been exhausting and my brain is fried.
hm7mut6,shadow_chance,11/26/2021,1,23.5% towards retirement isnt really out of the question. Now if youre having trouble saving a down payment for a house or something then thats something you have to weigh. But unless you have substantial assets built up already dialing back isnt really what you should be doing.   You could be described as a HENRY. High Earner Not Rich Yet. Dialing back is going to make the latter part of that harder/take longer.
hm7rkqr,737900ER,11/26/2021,1,Its possible the receiving bank converted the check to ACH rather than cash it as a check. This happens to me all the time my rent sometimes shows up up as an ACH debit and sometimes as a a cashed check with images.

hm7itiy,Soontaru,11/26/2021,1,Sounds like you‚Äôre checking all the boxes in terms of what folks recommend on this sub. You didn‚Äôt mention much about your situation or expenses but I think the questions you need to ask yourself are: Are you still able to make ends meet at this savings rate? Are you grinding too hard at work to sustain it? How is your family‚Äôs outlook? How is your mental health?  If you don‚Äôt like the answers to some of these questions it‚Äôs okay to dial it back some. I‚Äôd defer to others as to where you could cut back but the bottom line is you gotta make it to the future intact in order to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Sounds like you‚Äôve picked up some good habits and built a great foundation but it‚Äôs important to find a balance between sacrificing for later and enjoying the now.
hm76jkp,Bicworm,11/26/2021,1,I would argue that an 18 year old in their first ten years employed will likely have pretty low marginal tax rates. Its definitely an option but keeping it as is gives them the ability to make that choice when they are a legal adult. Also one parent or another is going to end up footing the tax bill of their minor child. That ten year old cant file by themselves.

hm7ciqn,Ronin_Around,11/26/2021,1,You might want to also look into union apprenticeship trade jobs. Excellent job training while getting paid. Its a 5 year program after that you can travel and make excellent money.
hm8kn2s,thentangler,11/26/2021,1,I had the same issue‚Ä¶ I felt queasy re-negotiating for a higher salary‚Ä¶ however I had a very valid reason. In my case it was the housing in MA. I did my utmost to try to find housing that would not result in me losing money compared to what I was earning in my current job. But I really couldn‚Äôt.  I called the HR and told them that I tried my damdest to make the numbers work‚Ä¶ and I gave the exact numbers in how much extra I would need for me to offset the increase in housing compared to where I am living‚Ä¶ and to my surprise they agreed‚Ä¶.  So as long as you go back to them with clear numbers and with an honest and valid reason for re-negotiating they might entertain you.   But like one of the posters on here said‚Ä¶. You should also be comfortable with them declining your request or walking away from it if they refuse.

hm7k649,Varathien,11/26/2021,1,15% into retirement accounts is a common recommendation so I dont think you need to dial it back.   If youre hoping to retire early it makes sense to invest as much as you can.
hm8kzlw,firearmed,11/26/2021,1,As someone who lived in Europe for the last several years and recently moved back to the US. Yes US bad.   Paying *any* bill in the Netherlands takes 60 seconds. Scan a QR code open your bank app type in your pincode press accept. Paid instantly.  Same goes for transferring money to friends or family. Transactions post immediately and theres no question if the amount went through or not plus no middlemen like Venmo or Zelle to deal with no need to track which email address or phone number is attached to which account.  I went years without entering an account number on a payment because the entire country is on one unified modern system.
hm73k26,rowrowrowurbutt,11/26/2021,2,Thankfully another commenter posted some helpful resources. After reading through some of them I can see that her disinheriting the funds is also against federal regulations. Which is something that I didnt understand before because Im not familiar with SSI.  Resources also mention that the only real way to handle this situation legally is to set up a special needs trust which Ill check into next.
hm761tf,itreallybelikethat2,11/26/2021,2,You‚Äôre a military kid so you probably already know how to get into all that kinda stuff.   If you know that‚Äôs not what you want to do IMO I would see about how you can go to college for free first. Whether that‚Äôs in state or in Alabama or somewhere else try to go for free. Free means you won‚Äôt have debt try not to accrue any while you‚Äôre out there. But it is time for experience and learning college is a place you can find different things and interest and get your foot in all the odd little doors you‚Äôd like to. So I wouldn‚Äôt miss out on it unless absolutely necessary.    If that‚Äôs not what you want either or doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôd say to pick a trade. They‚Äôre in short supply these days and you learn more there than  you can at most regular jobs in my opinion as it rings true for me.   A 21 almost 22 year old high school drop out working on getting his ged currently but am employed as a sub contractor. I do home construction and remodeling. I‚Äôm working at a company that‚Äôs fairly new operating less than 2 years and I‚Äôm learning a lot. Pay is $17 an hour in the southern US as a helper. I like it I‚Äôve worked as a package handler for fedex too (hated it but I lost a whole lotta weight too so eh) I worked at a gas station managing night shifts 2 pizza places and a carwash and this is the hardest but most fulfilling job I‚Äôve had. I feel like I‚Äôm learning life skills. You know I can scan the fuck out of a package but that‚Äôs only gonna get me so far at this job I‚Äôve learned how to build a deck screen them in build walls frame houses etc. With enough time I can start my own company from what I‚Äôve learned there.   And that‚Äôs just one trade. Honest truth is you have more paths available than you‚Äôd probably think right now I‚Äôve been in the same spot and it‚Äôs a good and bad one to be in mentally at 19 in a way. Bad because you don‚Äôt want to feel like you‚Äôre coming to a dead end anywhere in life or that you‚Äôre stuck but good that you‚Äôve realized you want something more this young at that. You just need to figure out what that more is and you have time for that. As much as I praised being a tradesman college is still my first option for you personally.   Good luck man.

hm84ezl,WindfallForever,11/26/2021,1,I appreciate the feedback! Im planning on opening a Traditional IRA and maxing that out in a few months  Ill look into life insurance too. School loans Im planning on chipping away Im considering looking into refinancing so I can knock down some of the higher interest rates (highest ones are around 4.66%). Would you also recommend refinancing?
hm83opl,raduque,11/26/2021,1,So this is slightly inaccurate. The AU benefits from only the specific card added to their credit file. They get the card reported as if it was their own card the balance is shared between both cards and both users credit reports.   However if the main user of the credit card has bad things on their credit report it will not affect the AUs credit report or score unless the main user turns the AU credit card into a negative account.

hm745wt,lightnglass,11/26/2021,1,Thank you for breaking this down the way you did - it makes complete sense now.  Luckily I have only done the Roth contributions for a couple years so I am not totally mad at myself for doing that but I am definitely switching now.
hm82e60,t-poke,11/26/2021,1,If you want your car fixed or replaced call your insurance right now. The longer you wait the more suspicious it‚Äôs going to look.  They deal with your exact situation a thousand times a day. They will guide you through the process. That‚Äôs their job.
hm6ywlq,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,2,Yes it is up to him on how to come up with money to pay.
hm8hh3e,wutzeeheck,11/26/2021,1,Youre misunderstanding what it means by value. For capital gains tax on property the value is defined as what the parties involved agree on.  Not its professionally appraised value. Since the two parties involved agreed on $50 that sets the starting value to $50.
hm8n6vw,thekidwonder93,11/26/2021,1,Ill get downvoted for this Im sure but I think if he were going to steal your money he wouldnt have asked.  He will probably get fired and be in a worse situation than hes already in and who knows wholl suffer from that outside of just himself.  In the chance he does steal your money you would get it back from the bank - especially with the evidence you have of him asking you for it. I have had money stolen multiple times and been refunded for it - with not even 1% of the proof that you would have.  Im not excusing his behavior but do you feel its worth potentially destroying his life over? I personally dont think so - but to each their own.
hm71op1,AlanPavio,11/26/2021,12,I‚Äôm baffled as to why Chase would be unable to confirm the status of the check. If it was cashed they Chili‚Äôs have the details as to when and to what entity and if not cashed they should be able to stop pay reissue.
hm8rds0,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,2,A mobile home is not an investment under any circumstance and are nearly impossible to get loans on.    A manufactured home is permanently attached to a foundation built after 1976 and becomes real property.  A mobile home can be moved and converted into real property but it can be a convoluted and expensive process depending on where you live.
hm8l0ai,orangebot,11/26/2021,1,A gift from the parents‚Äô business to the child? I‚Äôm sorry but no. If it was coming from the parents directly then yes but as the OP states it is coming from the business IE it is not a gift IE there is capital gains tax.
hm79l8x,WryGrapes,11/26/2021,1,To add to the chorus - not all Bill Pay services do that.  Im unfamiliar with Chase though.
hm8d14o,Buttigieg2032,11/26/2021,1,Maybe wait a year or two until you get more used to things?  The program isn‚Äôt actually $90k. It‚Äôs $90k plus all your lost wages for 14 months‚Ä¶so it‚Äôs actually around $180k to go to this program.  I‚Äôd really try to find a situation in which you could do this part time. Is there an easier unit you can do (e.g. out patient).?  Also are you sure NP is $150k? Seems high unless you‚Äôre in California.
hm8fq0v,93195,11/26/2021,1,Nah mobile homes depreciate.  They are titled like cars.  You typically don‚Äôt own the land it sits on either at least if it‚Äôs in a mobile home park.  That said it‚Äôs a place to live.  If you buy a used mobile home it can be considerably cheaper than apartment rent so it‚Äôs not necessarily a dumb purchase.  But an appreciating asset it‚Äôs not.

hm8awz2,ruat_caelum,11/26/2021,1,Also you should join a credit union. You can join PenFed from anywhere in the US even if you arent a service member by donating like $15 to a military charity (check the web page for details.)  There are a lot of issues with banks but basically it boils down to this.  * A banks profits are paid to share holders. (The account holders in the bank are not customers they are the profit generating mechanism. e.g. fees etc) A credit unions profits are paid to the credit unions members. You are the cow being milked at a credit union you are a joint owner/shareholder/etc.

hm87vhs,International_Arm843,11/26/2021,1,idk how large ur portfolio is but you could always use your stocks as collateral for a loan to pay the downpayment which would also avoid a taxable event (selling stocks). most brokerages let you do it at 1.5-2.5 % interest rate
hm79sp9,mattbuford,11/26/2021,2,Some of my billpay receivers are electronic and some just get mailed physical checks.  For the ones that are physical checks I can pull up an image of the check.  On the back of the check I can see that the receiving company put their rubber stamp on the endorsement line.  I can also see the date it was posted (cashed/deposited by the receiver).  It even has the receivers bank routing number on it and another number which I assume is the depositors account number.  Maybe you saw the image of the check and didnt realize there is a button to view the back side too?  Im not in the banking industry but as far as I know the check images are not captured when the check is sent out.  They are captured when the check is deposited/cashed by the receiver.  If it wasnt deposited I wouldnt be able to see the images.  And thats why the image has the receivers signature/stamp on it.
hm6xm44,DSEEE,11/26/2021,2,In the UK.  A mortgage advisor once told me of a very solvent highly suitable client he had that was flat-refused a mortgage from multiple providers despite falling well inside affordability limits etc.  Turned out he had a LOT of frequent deposits to online gambling sites / bookmakers and apparently that flagged him as super high risk.
hm7vcqh,GreedyNovel,11/26/2021,1,>is like me telling you to just go and look up how to weld a 1 double bevel joint.  I honestly dont think there would be anything wrong with that either. Learning something new is rarely a bad thing and that goes for me too.  That said I repeat that learning how to build Excel spreadsheets is time well-spent. It isnt just about learning Excel its also about helping to understand how the math works. For life-changing decisions like this I respectfully suggest its worth taking the time to learn how.
hm7oh1w,Razberry910,11/26/2021,1,I cant say the army specifically but the military in general can be good for a four year tour. Airforce always seemed to have the nice stuff.

hm6tjgj,Do_Better_Today,11/26/2021,2,Lots of good advice here already. Here‚Äôs my advice as a retired airman with ~21 years active under my belt. And ironically it‚Äôs advice the military rarely follows:  Before you commit to anything make sure you define your exit strategy.  The military can be a great tool. It can give you good skills reasonable pay and benefits travel and educational opportunities. But surprisingly to some people a lot of that is optional and depends on you taking advantage of opportunities:  -	Did your research a good job and negotiate with the recruiter to ensure you could get it? -	Did you apply yourself to learn your job as quickly as possible and excel in it? -	Did you plan your exit so you have some savings and a plan for when you hit that four year mark?  I enjoyed my time in and it worked out well but I only planned on doing four years originally. I did not plan so at my four year point I just went ‚Äúoh well guess I‚Äôll sign up for four more since separating is terrifying‚Äù. Don‚Äôt do that.

hm82pyy,wickedkittylitter,11/26/2021,1,Youll be fine at $2k a month.  Normal advice is rent shouldnt be more than a third of your income.  You are well under that.  Add in no commuting costs and eating out (learn to cook if you dont know how) and youll still have plenty of funds each month.

In my opinion:  * if you need the tax deduction to maximize your contribution go Traditional. * If youre worried about RMDs go Roth.  To me the big difference between Traditional and Roth is that Roth IRAs are not subject to Required Minimum Distributions but everything else (including the Roth 401k) is.  Remember Congress is dumb.  Roll your Roth 401k to a Roth IRA?  Its now NOT subject to RMDs.  A few weeks ago I played with a couple online RMD calculators and determined that assuming my 401k doubles every 7 years (and thats the case if investments grow at 10% per year) then by the time Im 81 my RMD will be 4x my current salary.   but even then remember the Congress factor.  You do your best to predict the future but they keep rolling their dice in our lives.  How are you going to pay for CRNA school?  Seems to me you should cut back on investing to save for school.  Or will the job pay for school?
hm7swkf,Sawgwa,11/26/2021,1,Does the debit for the payment show on your bank records?
hm8obkc,OccasionAdditional39,11/26/2021,1,I assumed pay in cash and then cash out refi was the option being contemplated. Get the benefits of making a cash offer and then can take your time with the refi. I think interest rates are slightly higher than with a loan to purchase but I bet in this market that added cost is less than the benefit from making a cash offer.

hm7f8t8,Famous_Speech5408,11/26/2021,1,Just a heads up you want to keep your credit utilization around or below 10% instead of just under 30%. I followed the under 30% rule when I got my first credit card (I stayed around 20-25% utilization) and my first credit score was  kinda low after the initial 6 month period.   Turns out the credit bureaus were dinging my score for high utilization each month but I had no way of knowing until after the 6 month period.

hm8loax,dequeued,11/26/2021,1,In addition to freezing your credit and complaining to both the banks corporate office as well as the branch manager:  1. I would strongly consider [changing banks](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions).  2. I would [file a complaint with the CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/).  3. I would also file a complaint with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency the FDIC or your state banking authority. Which one depends on how the bank is chartered. If you go to [this usa.gov page](https://www.usa.gov/complaints-lender) and click on Complaints about deposit accounts it explains and has links for each option.
hm79kdk,PutinBoomedMe,11/26/2021,1,My dude you need to visit a CFP.    Letsmakeaplan.org     If it is a pension youre likely best rolling the funds into IRAs if theres no need for the money now. Unfortunately if dad passed after January 1st 2020 the kids essentially have a 10 year clock from the date of death to empty the accounts. With limited income and taxation you could try and take dustributions in 10 chunks as you approach the deadline. I doubt it very much any of these funds are Roth especially if it is a pension and was employer funded.      You could roll to the inherited IRA and still invest. Each year you could move shares to a brokerage account in-kind. The custodian for the money could withhold taxes but its likely that isnt an issue and you could just move straight up shares to the brokerage account from the inherited IRA. At the end of the 10 years you still invested and pulled the funds in a tax efficient manner. Unfortunately there arent any rules in place that allow you to convert an inherited IRA to an inherited Roth IRA. Even if these funds were Roth balances the kids would till have to empty the accounts by the 10th anniversary of the death. Again this is assuming dad died after January 1st of 2020

hm7h2i0,SkyDog1972,11/26/2021,1,earlier this year  one of the months in 2020  The first sentence makes it as clear as mud how long after the payment should have been made that the landlord let OP know it was missing. It could be as little as one month up to about 20 months.  A little clarification from OP would be helpful.
hm78chk,blondie401,11/26/2021,1,Yeah makes sense! I think mortgage companies that sell servicing can do lower rates because they make up for some of that when they sell the rights to your loan. If all you care about is rate then definitely go by that!
hm6zdpa,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,1,That sounds correct as long as your insurance company isnt wanting to total the car. Im not sure about Texas laws/rules around that. Also Im pretty sure the value of the vehicle is the insurance companys top dollar theyll pay out.   So I guess the next question is how happy have you been with the car? Id say factor that into your decision making as well.   Im glad you werent hurt. That is the most important part of all of this.

If the university takes those then they should look at taking CLEP/DANTES exams. They can knock out a lot of general education credits through them and theyre a lot faster than taking an actual course.  If they scored well enough to become a linguist by taking 5 CLEPs you can get an Associates degree in your language straight from the Defense Language Institute as long as you pass the course.

Seems unlikely that the teller is going to do anything illegal otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt have sent you the message. He‚Äôs just underpaid and desperate (and stupid.)  And now he‚Äôll probably get fired for his stupidity and will be worse off than before.  Some people just aren‚Äôt cut out to function in this society. Very sad. But you really have no choice other than to report it to the branch manager.
hm7740l,oceanleap,11/26/2021,0,You can open an account with Fidelity and buy a Retirement fund like FFFDX . This will have about 50% in stocks and 50% in bonds/cash. So fairly stable and low risk but some opportunity for growth (or loss). Any financial advisor would likely say this is a decent choice. Put your kids as beneficiaries to the account and also make a will naming them as heirs. You can give them both some cash now also as much as you want. I would give it no strings attached if its about 10k. Or you can say youll help them with a house down-payment when they are ready to buy. You will likely have to pay tax on some of the land gain get a tax accountant to help you with that.  Talk to an accountant before you sell in case there are things you need to do earlier.  In terms of taking money out for living expenses most people say anyone can take out 4% of the money er year and have it last indefinitely. At age 73 you can definitely take out more. Maybe 7% per year? So if you end up with 200k after taxes thats 14k per year. Good luck OP. Also ask your accountant to make sure you dont lose any benefits you are currently entitled to.
hm6skg9,pelexus27,11/26/2021,1,If you decide to go with liability only insurance make sure that you can afford any issues that pop up like having your car totaled or stolen.

hm78o7s,alex2000ish,11/26/2021,1,Ok I actually had this exact same issue with Chase. They eventually figured out that they sent the exact same check to my landlord twice.  Same check number and everything. The landlord deposited the first one it cleared then tried to deposit the second one which bounced because that same check number had already been deposited. I ended up having Chase send my landlord an official letter stating that they messed up and issued the same check twice which my landlord accepted and called the situation resolved.
hm73ru4,throw-away-doh,11/26/2021,3,It sure sounds like free education and career opportunities until America gets into a real shooting war with somebody. We live in an unprecedented time of peace.

hm7jkco,CapeMOGuy,11/26/2021,1,Sorry for your loss. Lots of good advice in here.   I would like to add that most of us lose some decision making capacity for a time after a trauma. Try to avoid life changing decisions for six months or so. (Moving away quitting school selling house changing career etc.)   Added some other circumstances not facing you for others who might see.

hm8beyo,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,Keep it in an account in your name that you know is designated as being for him.  /u/brawlrats is correct. You cant contribute to an IRA (Roth or Trad) for him if he doesnt have earned income.  Once he does have earned income you can start making contributions to a Roth for him using the money youve saved for him.

hm8llkj,Dariusraider,11/26/2021,1,Somethings gotta give and while its usually not a preferred option honestly getting a nice chunky student loan to stay afloat sounds like the best solution to me. You need to be able to commit enough time to your studies to be worth anything and be there for your kids at least somewhat and constantly working makes that basically impossible. Getting a proper student loan solves all of that without being the worst thing(interest stays manageable time to pay it off before that even etc.).  EDIT: I mean thats in part what student loans are for helping people pay their way through school(the other part is actually paying FOR the school). A lot of people get them to not work through it and on top you have a couple kids to worry about. The idea of getting through education debt-free is nice and all and if one can do it great but its a ton of work in the best case scenario and IMO at this point you are just trying to do way too much at once. Get the loan and focus on the things that matter.
hm8bian,Annonymouse100,11/26/2021,1,Don‚Äôt panic. Your best bet is probably to get everything filed in January 2022 (2019-2021). The IRS limit e-file services from late November to early January every year in order to update their system. I believe they are still fairly backlogged on paper returns and I was advised by my CPA to wait until January when they system is back on-line to file my back taxes because even with the wait it is quicker than they are getting back confirmation on paper filing.   https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/modernized-e-file-mef-status  In the meantime if you think you may owe money you can speak with a tax advisor about making a payment towards your 2021 tax liabilities before the end of the year in order to limit any penalties.   The important thing is not to let it become overwhelming. If your taxes are relatively simple you can likely still DIY but if they are overwhelming to you sometimes it is still better to just go ahead and pay a professional to get them done for you.

hm8dz61,RubyRidgebackmomma,11/26/2021,1,Depends on the state you live in as well. For instance in Oregon insurance follows the car not the person. So if I have full coverage anyone is covered to drive it. Now of course the insurance co. wants to know all drivers so they can base your rates on them as well. But if you don‚Äôt tell them most they could do is exclude that person from your policy for the future or cancel you. But they would have to pay the claim. But that‚Äôs just Oregon each state has different insurance laws.
hm8m6zm,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/26/2021,1,$3000 or that neighborhood doesn‚Äôt seem worth it for declaring bankruptcy.

hm7x1or,gguru001,11/26/2021,1,I m answering a question you are not asking and maybe you already know the answer but people that retire from investment income will generally maintain investments but the investments themselves will change to favor ones that have historically carried less risk.  This has been standard enough that some funds will do it for you based on age or by your choice.    The other thing is to never annuitize a fund if you dont have to.  Just withdraw what you need or what you are forced to withdraw by law.

hm8eo1r,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,With your logic every homeowner would be liable for capital gains taxes after selling their house for a profit which isn‚Äôt true. Only investment proprieties are charged capital gains taxes after selling. You‚Äôre right you have to pay taxes on profits but not all profits are capital gains taxed.
hm71f79,Spcynugg45,11/26/2021,2,No problem it‚Äôs helped me in the past and I‚Äôm sure it could help you. Some 0% deals will even give you more than 12 months so while it‚Äôs best to pay off CC debt as soon as possible if you‚Äôre really disciplined you could do it over a longer period.   So for example if you‚Äôre having to put $800+ / month on the CC to payoff $9000 + interest in one year if you had 18 months to pay off $9450 at 0% interest you‚Äôd only need to pay $525 a month. That gives you an extra $275 for your car payment without impacting your budget at all.   Some people are going to take issue with using that kind of budgeting logic since you‚Äôre adding an unnecessary expense and not prioritizing debt reduction at all cost but if you automate payments and set it/forget it then it‚Äôs a great way to solve your financial issues over time without it taking up a lot of brain space.
hm6ywm2,Hi5Kokonu,11/26/2021,-1,RoR is important here are they matching up to 6% what are the rates on your loan and yes you need to add more into savings for emergency - emergency fund needs to be established before anything else. Also some of 401ks arent worth the match for example mine currently is 2% my return annually is better if I max out early than maximize my employers match

Should have told her to fuck off but instead I just said ‚ÄúI wanted to have some cash on hand why?‚Äù And this is where I‚Äôm still pissed about it years later. She says something like ‚Äúwell many people will take out large cash withdrawls for drugs.‚Äù  Again I can‚Äôt believe this teller said this. Now this branch was not my normal one and in an area that is not known for having wealthy residents but the nerve. I wish I would have stopped and asked for a manager right there.

hm85o10,scar-l_sagan,11/26/2021,1,I work for Chase so I can provide a little context.  Venmo like any other app such as Cash App has little to no recourse to get your money back. if you accidentally sent money to the wrong person or someone got ahold of their number/account /etc. there is no legal recourse to return the money.  Something like a credit card has security features to get your money back promptly (a la charge back) which is essentially what youre paying for using a credit card.  Tldr: need to pay with verifiable proof? Pay with someone elses money (the banks) not yours. Pay off your bills with your money
hm6ttnn,Frogsplash48,11/26/2021,1,Thanks! Yes a good surprise. Still wrapping my head around it.   And you were right. I selected the HDHP because I was thirsty for the HSA benefits. Not great.
hm7hf46,DiscoIsntDead,11/26/2021,1,Youre probably good for a while. Just take 1 percent divide by 12 and save that amount every month.
hm702lq,shadow_chance,11/26/2021,1,Its usually phrased as household so including his is fine. It just needs to be estimate. As long as youre not trying to gain large credit lines for fraud they dont care.
hm73ey0,Breastrollshaker,11/26/2021,6,It‚Äôs part of his compensation
hm8l8ze,petron5000,11/26/2021,1,Screenshot to the CEO of the bank and the head of fraud and risk via email. CC the branch manager. Tell them you are closing all your accounts on Monday.   Insist on them handing you a bank draft for your entire balances in person by the manager at your convenience on Monday.
hm8hanu,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,No generally they would have to cover the claim.  But they could cancel you and that cancellation for suspected insurance fraud would show up on your CLUE report causing you to have a difficult time getting insurance in the future.  Its not worth risking losing your insurance to commit fraud to avoid adding a driver that is unlikely to increase your rates.
hm7d6vw,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,I would go for the full 5% as it is free money
hm6ubzr,Fubbalicious,11/26/2021,1,To echo what everyone is saying this is bad advice.  You should definitely contribute up to your full employers match because not doing so is leaving behind free money at the table.  If you want a guide on where to divert your money and why read the [prime directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) on the side bar and in particular look at the [graphical flow chart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png).

hm6y8bm,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,3,The loan is tied to the employer 401k.  Not the custodian.  The loan will not transfer even though Fidelity is the custodian of both 401ks.
hm7plsy,wearitout222,11/26/2021,1,So now Im thinking Im gonna buy a van then bring it back for the offer. Use the 7000 to reinovate the van and get it ready for the road. Hopefully the offer stays good til i get my van. Would love it if i get my van this week.
hm7ja2u,LyricalPig,11/26/2021,1,>The vehicles I buy dont typically depreciate  This is untrue unless you are talking about the outlier that has been the last year.  Otherwise cars are outrageously poor stores of wealth and lose their value quickly.  >and if that doesnt make sense to you think about it.  If you are paying cash thats great but if they are more than half your income and you dont have much net worth you are putting too much money into things that lose value
hm7pcok,YoshiMain420,11/26/2021,1,Yes you can.
hm7s0mz,BennyDR,11/26/2021,1,what price have you gotten on the non-hybrid models?
hm89q0a,NuisanceTax,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôm driving a 2011 Mustang with a salvage title. I spent about $400 redoing some body work the reseller had halfway pieced together but I knew that when I bought it. No problems at all.   Google the VIN and see if you can find pictures of the wrecked vehicle (before repairs have been made) or ask the seller for them. That will tell you a lot about what damage to expect. Avoid any vehicle on which the airbags have deployed as those are hard to get replaced correctly and that can be a safety risk. Certainly avoid anything flood damaged as those can become expensive money pits.   Banks won‚Äôt often lend money on salvage titles so you may either have to pay cash or get the lot to finance it. And don‚Äôt plan on getting anything much when you trade it. Just drive the wheels off and then scrap it - or sell it to someone else with cash who wants a good cheap car.
hm8qjdl,omg463643,11/26/2021,1,Last transaction prior to the 24th was $40.83 made on the 23rd which is included in the statement   Two charges of $40.83 which total to the statement balance of 81.66
hm74shg,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,2,When youre uneasy the best thing you can do is move money from your account you get direct deposit into a separate account specific for bills and transfer money into that to account for stuff on autopay to make sure it gets paid. This can help from over spending. Then when you want to eat out or whatever you can still use your CC but you want to ensure theres money in your bank account to pay off your cc.
hm8db2j,bro69,11/26/2021,1,You need 3 months of cash so you can avoid credit card debt. THEN you max out match. Then you max IRA. Then max out 401k. Then low risk brokerage. Then Insurance then stocks. Then play money on high risk. Throw some real estate in there IMO using house hacking and you‚Äôre set.
hm6xkra,drepidural,11/26/2021,1,Agreed. I switched from chase to TD and they don‚Äôt withdraw the $ until the check is cashed.   Don‚Äôt miss Chase for checking or savings.
hm6vpyg,Gavilan_y_Paloma,11/26/2021,1,Thank you... I am not looking forward to this experience so any help we can get is so appreciated.
hm6wdv3,microbial64,11/26/2021,1,The problem may be your total income to debt ratio. If you take more debt add another house will the bank loan you? When we sold our first house to buy the second (on contingency) we were in a bad spot as our buyer was having money problems (who the F buys a brand new car in the middle of closing on a house) and had to look at floating both payments. Bank said that our ratio was too high and wouldnt have the option to have both debts.
hm7ir8r,seridos,11/26/2021,1,Unfortunately I would think that the order of operations would be the renter would pay the late fees and then in turn go after the bank for said fees.
hm8sk13,realglueboy,11/26/2021,1,Thats what I told them. They basically just steamrolled past it and said they couldnt give me my money back. They also said that they saw no weird log-in attempts which cant be the case either. Ive only used Paypal to order stuff from Games Workshop. So it definitely wasnt through any of my devices
hm8gf60,4510,11/26/2021,1,How comfortable are you walking away from the new offer if they dont play ball?
hm865es,SeriousMannequin,11/26/2021,1,I had to apply for a new credit card because I wanted a new hotel credit card.   Experian will actuary do like a one time access pin for whoever you are applying with to pull it for a short time.   Works for me as I had me and my family members‚Äô credit frozen ever since the big hack.   No doubt they‚Äôre still updating in the background though not like we have any choice or say in this matter.
hm79n5h,jPharm247,11/26/2021,2,just commenting bc Im in Illinois too had to use an estate lawyer for my moms estate and honestly loved and would recommend the guy. he directed us to a fa that I interviewed but didnt use and a tax guy/accountant that I dont love but still use 4 years later.   essentially what Im saying is it may be a good jumping off point for you to figure this all out via a professional. would be happy to give contact info for lawyer if needed (hes based in cook County Im in lake)
hm8afrj,ParryLimeade,11/26/2021,1,Incorrect. Auto bill service are cashed out of your account at the time the check is issued. I had the same thing happen as OP and had to have the bank void it
hm8ieow,Birdy_Cephon_Altera,11/26/2021,1,I work for the bank and yeah someone doing something like this is just as bad.  Its the type of firing where you can expect theyll be walked out by security with everything in a cardboard box before the end of the day.

hm8gbkn,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,Still the method I am most comfortable with. When I rented from a complex I paid with an online portal and never had an issue. But the people I rent from now are scum and I treat them as such.
hm85k5n,frozeninjpthrowaway,11/26/2021,1,Considering how ACH operates (batch files only processed a couple times a day? Really?) yeah still America bad in that case. Integrated universal (not the patchwork of third party systems the US ended up with) instant payment shouldve been built ages ago like Faster Payments in the UK or Osko in Australia.
hm7h20n,krustymeathead,11/26/2021,1,you can never do too much imho. the more you save the earlier you can retire! make sure youre having a fulfilling life but other than that save away!
hm7xz5x,maggiemoo91,11/26/2021,1,Same in NZ banks stopped accepting cheques this year. Seems bizarre that its still common practice in the US!
hm8bls4,KJ6BWB,11/26/2021,1,When keeping the books for a company assets is a debit account and getting paid is a debit.  A business expense or paying money credits your asset account.  Thats the perspective Im used to.  Point is my bank (USAA) sends out regular checks and that amount isnt pulled from my account until the person receiving the check deposits it.
hm7ffvf,zBunnyslayerz,11/26/2021,1,Unless you want to be the guy that relies on their parents to pay their bills you should not invest anything in your 401k until you have a 3-6 months emergency fund. After that invest up to the match then invest the rest in an IRA.   I would not rely on your parents as a backup plan if things do not work out as that could damage the relationship and your parents could view you as taking advantage of them. My dad loves me a ton and has my back but if my lifestyle and financial decisions deem that I need to rely on him for money he will not be happy.
hm875vz,dmooortin,11/26/2021,1,Not sure about yours but I have payed my rent with Venmo before to get the sign on bonus for a new card and it worked perfectly fine. Only downside is it was a 1% charge for using my credit card on Venmo.  Edit: Although I was renting a room privately and not paying a property management company so your situation may be different.
hm6uaz5,DrGreenMeme,11/26/2021,1,Reread what I said. I‚Äôm saying I would **not** expect someone on minimum wage to be able to save that much.
hm8gwwh,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,1,I appreciate that. I hadn‚Äôt thought about retaliation but feel well prepared from a personal protection standpoint.
hm8nqge,roombataxi,11/26/2021,1,Set financial goals.  Figure out what your targets are and when you want to meet them.  Work backwards from there to figure out what you want to be contributing today to meet those goals.  That way youll have a reasonable guidepost to how much you should be saving.
hm8dv53,bittz128,11/26/2021,1,Get the free money from work by hitting their match limit but also put some aside in an emergency fund.  If you don‚Äôt have rent this should be what you put there. No car payment?  Put it aside.  The free money and 8% and higher rate of return will pay off in the long run.  School loans have a low interest rate and are tax deducted - but only when you make below 75k.  Deductions phase out above this.  If you fall on hard times a 401k can be used as an emergency fund tax free.  You would classify it as a ‚Äúhardship‚Äù.  Your dad is a smart man but likely doesn‚Äôt know all the advantages of a 401k  Edit:  A lot of people pointing out that you should pay down the 0 point loan but think for a second. If I lose nothing now by paying minimum on the loan in order to make 200 more a month that will get an 8% return wouldn‚Äôt I want to get in there early?  I imagine your school loans will be less than 5%.  If I‚Äôm making 8% and paying 5% I‚Äôm ahead by 3 points and still made the extra cash and time to compound my investment.  Cash is king and the more of it you have on your side in (preferably making interest to keep ahead of inflation) is in your favor. It will allow you to weather the long term storms better.  School loans also have hardship deference and deferment if you go back to school.
hm849xj,Tellme1more,11/26/2021,1,Max your 401k and make some sacrifices to get your emergency fund in place. Then start to figure things out. You‚Äôll feel good and your dad will will be happy. You got this

hm8ekis,kohl_eyes,11/26/2021,1,I did this with my house. Never regretted it for a minute. I was happy to do it. I also trusted my realtor as wed worked with her multiple times before .
hm7ci8e,IceCreamforLunch,11/26/2021,1,Thats not true. The lifetime gift tax exemption is for the giver. It can be doubled for a married couple.
hm8i0pd,Gorf_the_Magnificent,11/26/2021,1,Yes it‚Äôs too late. Either stick with the agreement or withdraw from it (assuming there is no fixed period of performance).  Don‚Äôt start out with a new employer by immediately demonstrating that you are indecisive and your word is no good.
hm6txcr,MINIMAN10001,11/26/2021,31,I mean its wage theft which is hot water anyone in a position of authority has a duty to the company to get it resolved as soon as possible. Competency varies.
hm728ig,bakedpotatoe17,11/26/2021,4,Yea they‚Äôre really just concerned with where your earnest money and down payment are coming from and then verifying that you don‚Äôt receive suspicious large cash deposits. Typically even if you do have something weird it can be cleared through underwriting with a letter of explanation which just tells them how/what/why.
hm7lp7g,NoProblemsHere,11/26/2021,1,That just means that the renter is using a service not that they arent liable if the service does not perform. In theory the renter pays the fees and then goes after the 3rd party to reimburse fees caused by their negligence. In practice of course things tend to be a lot murkier. It *is* a bit odd that the landlord didnt say anything until just now but IANAL so I have no idea if that would help OP in any way.
hm7hme9,Firm_Bit,11/26/2021,1,Its only too much if it overshoots your plan. Sounds like youre just maxing things without having crunched the numbers and set a target retirement #.   Decide on your goal retirement number. Plan to hit that.
hm7z5pu,War-Square,11/26/2021,1,I agree with your Dad. At 24 your priority should be building a life not paying your retired self. I would put that savings in something more liquid like an index fund.
hm8te8l,CostofRepairs,11/26/2021,2,$10k in cash is the reporting threshold.   Also if you told them you were loaning that much cash to someone they might be concerned about fraud and file a Suspicious Activity Report.    The Employer info was for the CTR to see if it might be your employer making contributions  under the table to someone. Or to see why say a janitor has a $20K random cash outflow.
hm86meq,MobbBenz,11/26/2021,1,Max your tax advantaged accounts first.  401k then HSA then Roth IRA.
hm81tje,ForeverALone_Ranger,11/26/2021,1,Thanks but this has nothing to do with balancing accounts. The funds were withdrawn on time same as every other month.
hm7q0h5,Firm_Bit,11/26/2021,1,Yeah this is essentially what we figured would happen. Thanks. I appreciate someone else confirming it‚Äôs a viable path or at least something to look into.
hm8904u,shipwreck17,11/26/2021,1,No joke. Our first house didnt get curtains for a year because we couldnt agree on a fabric then had sticker shock.
hm8tzt4,kushhcommander,11/26/2021,1,In this market and with the futures of car sales begin virtually unpredictable given foreign manufacturing trucks will hold their value extremely well over the next few years.
hm7c4ou,OnlyPostSoUsersXray,11/26/2021,1,Yes 100% match for the first 3% and 50% match after that up to 5%.
hm7td79,tlollz52,11/26/2021,1,It depends  if you think  you can swing  it. My aunt  joined the airforce because  she didnt  know what else to do. She retired  from. It 20 years later with a doctorate in a field that only has a few qualified  people.  She even worked on something  that was involved  with air force one! On the other  hand you can only spend  4 years following  shit orders and get your  college  paid for and have good work experience. It just comes down to can you handle  the military? I know people  who joined  and got kicked out which is the worst part. I know  other people  who joined and absolutely  hated it but they finished  their stint and got out.
hm7v37p,HauntedGuns82,11/26/2021,0,Question: What would be the best way to make the most out of $50000?  I was in a car accident and details aside I received a 50000 settlement. Anyways I want to make the most out of it.  I am looking for direct answers not just ‚ÄúInvest it.‚Äù or ‚ÄúSave it.‚Äù ‚Äîno shit.  Thanks y‚Äôall.
hm8db0m,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôve been trying to convince myself that he doesn‚Äôt have access to my accounts.  Naivety more than anything I suppose.
hm8kaeo,orangebot,11/26/2021,1,The OP is not buying at market value.
hm8kwea,tacotruck2112,11/26/2021,1,The website you linked is not from IRS (a preferred source for getting correct advice) however your link says the following:    An In-Service Withdrawal withdrawal is taken for personal use from an employer-sponsored retirement plan like a 401k while still employed **and age 59.5 or older**. Not all employer-sponsored plans allow in-service withdrawals.   If permitted the withdrawal **must meet certain requirements depending on whether the withdrawal comes from an employer contribution or employee contribution**.  I stand by my comment but would be happy to look at your SPD if you can link it here somehow.
hm7r1fx,danfirst,11/26/2021,1,Depends on the details of the mortgage itself they mentioned interest only so is it interest only and variable? Either way yeah its just a math problem costs savings break even time etc.
hm8o0q4,pforsbergfan9,11/26/2021,1,Benefit of the doubt is a teller giving incorrect change not stalking
hm7v3qk,krone-icals,11/26/2021,1,Liable? For what? Ive never owed them loans debts anything. It was just a savings account I decided to end and they wouldnt give me my money back. No weird timing terms minimums nothing like that just a savings account.  Ive looked through their terms and as far as I can tell its 100% their problem but Im no lawyer and dont want to waste more time on it I just dont want them to think that that is ok!
hm6v21t,mynewaccount5,11/26/2021,2,Mine has a single chapter so that may be part of the issue.   Im an engineer so we mostly dont even have unions.
hm73apn,dawigas,11/26/2021,1,You should watch ‚Äúthe money guy show‚Äù on YouTube they gave a lot of stuff about this

hm7s6ep,eggbirdegg,11/26/2021,1,I wonder why its cheaper in California? Maybe better to buy from Cali and spend 1.2k and have it shipped to Florida.
hm8a6xo,Buttigieg2032,11/26/2021,1,Will your employer pay for some of it?   My wife is going to NP school part time and her current hospital is putting $12.5k a year towards it.
hm8ikft,Annahsbananas,11/26/2021,1,To be honest you should have acted the moment they messaged you. At the very least get your money moved and contact the bank manager
hm7cgop,DDChristi,11/26/2021,1,That doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. All new recruits have been switched to a 401K type of situation.
hm8h1of,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,I got my info from the IRS too. It specifically says you‚Äôre only liable if the value of the car increases not if you bought it for less than it‚Äôs worth.
hm8pfdd,ITryHardSometimes,11/26/2021,1,If you can get your own land and a mobile home with a metal roof that is much more affordable than a stick or brick House and you can get it all paid off quick and have less debt then you‚Äôll have money to invest in yourself so that you can make more money and then do whatever you want. Be aware that some land requires Wells and septic tanks which are a hefty investment in themselves.
hm74xpu,ALPHAPRlME,11/26/2021,3,If you intend to get vested then match. If not and you are using this to springboard to a better or higher-paying position in the same field your fathers advice is sound. Money is never free even if time is the only cost.

hm707d3,acidrain69,11/26/2021,2,You boss is telling you to budget for the max bonus? Ignore that. Budget for $70k.
hm8pi8s,Nagisan,11/26/2021,2,Not much considering the minimum is $25k - at that amount the $7/mo ($84/yr) is only 0.336%. Taken out of the 4% its still a solid 6.5x higher (at 3.664%) than most traditional HYSAs at 0.5%.    That said Id rather hold $25k in other places that average notably higher than 4% with much lower fees too...
hm6zzr3,lemmecheckit,11/26/2021,2,Death or PTSD both are worse than having to figure out how to get financial aid   PTSD can turn you into a monster.
hm76sfz,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,2,You shouldnt be charged a fee from the cc the balance is being pulled from usually because its similar to a payment.  The cc company thats giving the balance transfer promo does it also apply to a convenience checks written as well? If so you could write a check and the other cc shouldnt know its a balance transfer and charge you a fee.
hm8l0e5,katmndoo,11/26/2021,1,Move it to your investment account. Then open a new account at another institution. Perhaps your investment house.

hm80qsu,WillyValentine,11/26/2021,1,I am a Nigerian prince.   Never find someone online and never use any insurance agent advisor. I advise doing some homework to see what you believe your strategy should be. Then and only then find a fiduciary.  Even then a fiduciary means they are legally responsible to protect your assets.  It doesnt mean they are any good.

hm8dkbf,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,In your situation I wouldnt bother with saving for a down payment.  Use a VA loan and get into a home while interest rates are low.  You only need to have sufficient savings for your emergency account which I would have at least 5% of the homes purchase price plus six months of expenses.  The 10k you will have in two months should cover about half of that.  After your home situation is settled then look at your expenses again and pay everything you dont need to your future self.
hm8pelo,TheReverendBill,11/26/2021,-8,Maybe a little bit of an overreaction but the teller is at least violating some professional ethics.
hm8u2af,ZenGuruji,11/26/2021,2,Call your insurance company and see what they advise. You can probably call her and get her insurance info.  In the future always get driver information and insurance info when there‚Äôs an accident. Also call for a police report as soon as the accident occurs. Who cares if the other driver thinks it‚Äôs no big deal? You want to protect yourself.
hm7help,redapoluza,11/26/2021,1,It needs new sway links a new oil pan a new tranny pan a new exhaust manifold and front axle seals need replaced. Ive gotten 2 quotes from shops i both consider to be reliable and its looking like 2500-3k . I dont have tools a good driveway to even make repairs myself or the know how to do any of it. So a shop is pretty much the only option for me if i am repairing myself
hm6vqq6,Bobbyjohns,11/26/2021,5,Please call a CPA/EA and talk through all of the options.   There are Kiddie tax issues at play and is above reddits pay grade.
hm7i1ew,Lollc,11/26/2021,4,...I feel comfortable with them as a safety net.. You shouldnt.  I suspect this is at the heart of your dads reasoning.  He knows hes not going to live forever and he doesnt want to work til he dies.
hm851wo,Wahoo2K8,11/26/2021,1,Seconding what t-poke said.    You pay your insurance to handle this.  Let them do it.  The fact that the other driver was (or may have been) drunk is more or less irrelevant.  That‚Äôs a criminal matter between the driver and the state.
hm89pdu,Morepaperplease,11/26/2021,1,This is going to sound insensitive- however I just went through this   The guilt and wanting to make it better is overwhelming.  But this was bigger than me.  She needed way more than I could do and if I did sign up for helping it would consume me rusk losing my family create a vacuum of financial and bury me.  She needed medical attention and I let the State take over. They sold her hoarded house they put her in a nursing home where she can now bathe ever day get clothes food watch tv interact with other people and have health care in  a safe place.  She was not capable after her stroke of using assisted living because she refuses to clean herself and surroundings- and she is happier!  It worked out. But I had to let go.  I am sorry about your situation.  Some things are just bigger than ourselves.
hm7zmkw,addicuss,11/26/2021,1,Bill pay is a convenience.  The way it works is like this. You go to your bank and set auto pay. You set an auto pay for your car payment. Because the loan is with a well known bank BofA has ACH setup and has them on the system. You set up bill pay and your payment goes directly to their account.  You then go in and setup auto pay to a landlord. You dont have their bank info you just have the landlords name and address.you set it up through The same bill pay but the bank cuts a check.  To the customer its seamless but its using whatever information you have available.
hm8dq89,wutzeeheck,11/26/2021,1,You are 100% wrong about how capital gains tax works. The professionally appraised value doesnt matter. The value chosen by the two people who made the first sale vs the value chosen by the two people who made the second sale matters. OP invested money into a vehicle. He got more money than he invested. That is capital gains.
hm799nt,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,1,You really need to compare youre expenditures with the rewards. Points vs cash back doesnt really matter because you can convert (usually) the points to cash so as long as youre not limited to using the points on something specific then it doesnt matter.  I combine a card with high percentage category card with a no category card.
hm77lw9,jimspokane,11/26/2021,1,no that is not the way an AU works from a credit reporting standpoint.  The AU is reported the same as the account owner.  Account owner doesn‚Äôt pay or commits fraud the AU credit report takes a beating. Account is over 30% utilization AU takes a hit just like account owner.  The AU can certainly try to dispute but as long as the information is reported correctly the dispute won‚Äôt fly.  Best advice is don‚Äôt become an AU with anyone that isn‚Äôt a responsible credit user and certainly don‚Äôt commit fraud as an AU.  The only real difference between an AU and joint account holder is that the AU is not responsible for the management and payback of the card.  The rest of the equation is pretty much the same for both types of account holders.
hm79chk,WafflingToast,11/26/2021,2,I would give up the second job for something closer to your parents house.  Car expenses are going to be a big part of your budget now and the commute will be tedious no need to do a 2 hour trip on the weekends as well.  Even if its slightly lower paying you would be better off.    I would find a gym closer to your parents house and I would also make plans on the weekends with friends maybe every two weeks or right after work for job 1.  It sucks to just not stop by and hang out but a firmer financial footing will be better for you in the long run.
hm8l64h,maekkell,11/26/2021,1,Fantastic. Thank you!!
hm7ed06,vrtigo1,11/26/2021,1,If youre using bill pay my understanding is they send a check and the funds stay in your account until the check is cashed the same as if you wrote a check yourself.  So assuming thats accurate cant you just look at your Chase accounts statements to see if the check has cleared?  If thats not how Chase works (i.e. they take the funds out of your account immediately and send a money order) then if they cant provide proof that it was cashed then based on what they told you the funds shouldve returned to your account after 90 days.  So again take a look at your statements to see if the funds came back.  If they did reissue the payment to your landlord.  If they didnt get Chase to refund the payment since its been more than 90 days and then reissue the payment to your landlord.  I suspect Chase will magically find some proof that the check was deposited which you can then give to your landlord.

hm7xcri,Scr0bD0b,11/26/2021,1,If Im reading this correctly you had $10K of cc debt decided not to get a job but instead pile on an additional $15K for a second masters?  What was your plan before going into this for paying it off?  (seeing as good credit cards should be paid off in full each month ideally).  Two masters degrees and youre only going to make $40K?  Maybe you should look into doing a less intensive masters program so that you can also work...
hm6waqd,pizzatoucher,11/26/2021,1,Seconding what some other folks are saying DO NOT GET TRICKED BY YOUR RECRUITER. Dont sign anything until you have a path that works for you. Read the fine print.       I have relatives who were Army and frankly being infantry ruined their lives dont do it. DONT.   Coast Guard Air Force and Navy all have great options.   My spouse was in the Navy and while his time underway reallllly sucked (keeping sailors awake for 36+ hours a very toxic environment on that ship) as an adult the benefits have really helped us out a lot. Paid for his college and were able to use the VA loan for purchasing a home which has been fantastic.

hm7fb42,DBCOOPER888,11/26/2021,1,Getting the full match should be the first priority because its a 100% return and then you can focus on those other things. Like if something happened and you needed to pull from an emergency fund if you took an early withdrawal from your 401k youd still come out ahead compared to not investing to the match even considering the fees youd pay.

hm8tir6,Linkkie,11/26/2021,1,https://finance.zacks.com/federal-banking-rules-withdrawing-large-sums-cash-1696.html  This might help.  Also look up structuring deposits. If you get all 20k at once and deposit it theyll report you to the IRS but its not a bad thing. Intentionally breaking up your deposits to try to bypass the 10k reporting is illegal and called structuring.
hm6tzmt,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,The capital gains stacks on top of your regular income  $50k - $10k 401k - $12k deduction = $28k  40k - 28k = you have $12k @ 0% capital gains  If you want the money to be invested in index funds why not push anything over the $40k into your 401k? Youre paying 15% cap gains but getting 22% deduction meaning that IRS is actually paying you 7% to re-balance from taxable brokerage to 401k.  > Roth IRA. 6000 Limit per year. Can take contributions out penalty free and earnings penalty free for special instances. E.G purchase of first home.  Contributions can be taken out tax AND penalty free. Anything above that like the $10k home purchase is only penalty free  > Another potential advantage of opening a Roth instead of upping 401k would be the tax implications right? Since it is after tax money and grows tax free I do not pay capital gains tax on the sales   You never pay taxes on sales within an IRA or 401k. The only tax implications are when you take out money.
hm755kf,dudeson117,11/26/2021,1,I guess I would then claim just one excemption for me as I do not have spouse or children. Why would I want or not want to have any extra witheld?
hm7s9lx,Fiyahead,11/26/2021,1,It seems like their pay period is behind 2 weeks. Meaning your hours from 25th -  5th (2 week period) will be paid out on the 26th(today). Check with your HR. Some workplace are like this. I know I waited a whole month for a pay because of the pay period cycle.
hm7zkyh,ender323,11/26/2021,1,Because other developed countries (namely the EU) have mandated that banks introduce certain features and comply to certain standards. The US banking system is not nearly as heavily regulated and the banks have no desire to do it of their own accord. So our instant payment options are largely limited to services offered by third parties and sometimes integrated by banks like Zelle Cashapp and Venmo.
hm82s64,Hundred_Acres,11/26/2021,1,I think this should work. The big factors to consider is food IMO. The reason that I say this is because you will absolutely crush your bankroll if you are constantly ordering food.  Also if you don‚Äôt already pay all your bills you should start before you move out.  Other people might disagree but I don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong moving into a home rather than apartment but there are plenty of great things about apartments that can make it appealing.   I moved out of my parents house in my early 20s and it honestly changed my life. Not to say anything against my amazing parents but things are just different when you own your space. I think you have a healthy set up to do it.    Although you might also want to consider life insurance Roth IRA and getting a will done if you haven‚Äôt already looked into these things.  If you can afford it too once you move out kill all your bills that are non-permanent (school loans). But I don‚Äôt think I have to tell you this since you seem like you are doing things smart.

hm8jxf4,6553321,11/26/2021,1,I believe most bill pay checks are physical checks that get mailed. They can easily get intercepted by multiple people including the mailman the admin at the landlord or a bank employee. Someone could have cashed the check for cash instead of depositing to the account. This is a police report and not the OPs responsibility.
hm6xupz,Drill1,11/26/2021,5,That‚Äôs why I said contact a tax attorney.  It‚Äôs been over 10 years now since my daughter turned 18.  Also her mother and I were divorced when she died.
hm82b5m,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,Well I don‚Äôt have $1800. That‚Äôs why I offered to settle it for a lower amount. I assumed they‚Äôd at least respond with something but frankly - I don‚Äôt even know for sure I‚Äôm contacting the correct creditor since I can‚Äôt find the debt on any credit reports (did the free annual credit report website) and I‚Äôm basing this off of the mortgage guy telling me the amount and that it was with Target.   I‚Äôm not in a rush to buy a house. I only applied because there was a specific house that made sense and rent is so crazy it was a decent idea if that panned out. It didn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs fine but I hadn‚Äôt even remembered this target debt until it was brought up.

hm86p1b,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,Capital gains taxes is based off how much the value of the asset goes up when you bought it. Just because he bought it for $50 doesn‚Äôt mean the asset was worth $50. The value of the vehicle has likely gone down since he bought it. Not liable for capital gains taxes.

hm7i2t3,JustCallMeSmurf,11/26/2021,1,Not enough detail to provide you reasonable financial advice.   Interest rate on student loan debt?  Any other debt? Monthly budget? What is 401K invested in? Whats your risk appetite? Any major plans for any large purchase or change of lifestyle in next 5yrs?  Your dads trying to explain to you that its probably better to pay off your student loans versus invest money today hoping X% annual return in 35yrs.   Id put a minimum 3 months expenses in emergency fund high yield savings account.   The next step really depends on whether its worth the immediate savings right now to pay off the student loans and forgo the company match temporarily. But we dont know your budget and thus dont know your runway for how quickly the debt can be paid off
hm8i4lh,reboog711,11/26/2021,1,A bunch of my house contractors do not accept any other way.  It is frustrating.  Slowly these folks are harder and harder to find.
hm73ee8,red5765,11/26/2021,2,I would tell you to pay the minimums because you can earn more interest by investing (Id recommend this for most loans <7% interest.  But youre going to get  a lot of different opinions in here.  Id put that $11k in a High yield savings account for the wedding and emergency fund.  Thats enough to cover $2.5k for the wedding and 4.5 months of expenses.  You can open a high yield savings account and save for separate things (create categories).  Id create a separate category for your emergency fund wedding and house.  Since you want to buy a home in less than a year you should save it in a HYSA instead of investing cuz the market is unpredictable.  Yeah so just pay the min on those loans and save/invest.  If you through everything left over after your loan payments into the HYSA you should have at least $10k in the house fund after 12 month (835\*12) = $10020.  Then if your spouse is contributing $10k and your parents are contributing $10k youll have $30k for a 10% down payment on a 300k home in one year!

hm7394k,whatsmynamema,11/26/2021,2,Ive already gone through my budget and I cant spend any less than I currently do it leaves me roughly 400 per month to put towards debts. My issues seem to be the amount of unexpected expenses.  I use to be pretty bad with impulse purchases but In the past two/three months I havent gone over budget at all been really strict but made little to no progress due to external factors which is pretty frustrating because despite all my hard work im making no progress. Things like family/friends weddings/hotels household appliances breaking down car troubles etc.  In the long term 400 a month would be enough to pay of debts although it usually ends up much lower than that by the end of the month. its also pretty overwhelming to think of the scale of debt and how little a dent an entire months savings even makes.  Ill definitely have to look further into it do you have any recommendations ?
hm83z8x,Chonan_Akira,11/26/2021,1,I usually take cash from the money market fund. I rebalance periodically usually when I feel good about where the market is and add some to the money market fund.   In times of market disruption like today I do exactly nothing. I use an asset allocation that I mean to stick with during any ups or downs in the market. I review that allocation about yearly again when Im feeling okay about what the market is doing.   Not too scientific but I sleep well at night.

hm8s2t5,ShadowWebDeveloper,11/26/2021,1,Bank pays this typically. Bill pay is free for me to use at least.  Bigger companies will use ACH instead and when you add the payee the bank will know which ones can take ACH. This is more like a wire payment scenario (though still settles overnight).
hm8u27z,CinnabarEyes,11/26/2021,6,How confident are you the message is actually coming from your bank teller?

hm7eoev,SocialIQof0,11/26/2021,1,Hes wrong IMHO. Heres an article I like to show younger people about investing: [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/08/self-made-millionaire-david-bach-a-chart-changed-the-way-i-think-about-money.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/08/self-made-millionaire-david-bach-a-chart-changed-the-way-i-think-about-money.html)  If you dont want to go read/watch here is the most important take away:  The chart show two scenarios:  \-You start investing at 19 and contribute $2000 to your account every year until you reach 27. From 27 to 65 you contribute $0.  \- From 19 to 26 you don‚Äôt invest anything. You start investing at 27 and contribute $2000 to your account every year until you turn 65.  In the first scenario you‚Äôre only saving and investing for eight years in the second you‚Äôre saving and investing for 39 years. Still the person who starts at age 19 would end up with more money in their portfolio in the long run.  Assuming a 10% rate of return the first person would have $1.02 million by 65 while the second person would have $805185 a difference of more than $200000.  People vastly under estimate the importance of time in investing. Time is the greatest asset you have in investing.  Get those matched dollars.
hm8jpxo,MDfoodie,11/26/2021,1,401k contributions do reduce MAGI so you can easily dip below the Roth IRA limit for MFJ.  Then you don‚Äôt have to worry about rollovers into Roth IRA.

hm7z012,Dilettantest,11/26/2021,1,Talk to the bank: you might be able to open a separate custodial account to receive that SSDI payment then you could transfer the entire amount to your transactions account.  IANAL but I‚Äôd think you might also want to remove her name from that transactions account.  IRS debt isn‚Äôt discharged in bankruptcy but you can try to do an ‚Äúoffer in compromise‚Äù to get that debt down.  I doubt you‚Äôd be successful though because you do have equity in your home.  So see if you can increase your income by getting a weekend job to earn take home pay of at least $500-600/ month.  You could decrease your expenses by $100/month by changing your cellphone provider‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¶and another $100 by just getting fast internet (you‚Äôll probably pay $70-80/month by dropping cable).  If you could do that you‚Äôd be able to breathe a little more freely while you work on your business.

Except you can have a warm feeling that you didnt let this go without hurting the bank a little bit.   Next time. Ask ask again escalate and ask escalate and ask again. If you still havent won after those 4 attempts then go to the CFPB.  Because any further escalations will likely be thrown away because We already told the customer they suck nothing more we can do.

hm6wtlj,93195,11/26/2021,2,Really depends on the rental market. For a house in that price range it probably takes something around $2500 to $3000 a month to make renting worthwhile.  So can you reliably get that?    The other issues are that your new mortgage payment and cash out re-fi payments are ‚Äúfor sure‚Äù and rental income is dependent on both having a tenant at all and then that tenant actually paying.  Lots of landlord horror stories out there right now with non paying tenants they can‚Äôt evict.  Being a landlord is also work - when something breaks that‚Äôs on you to figure out and fix and do it right away.  Keeping and renting can be a solid idea depending on the market financials and your willingness to deal with the hassles of being a landlord.  It‚Äôs far from a slam dunk though.

hm72ijy,shadow_chance,11/26/2021,1,Buying a house in cash for people with bad credit isnt a terrible idea. The terrible idea comes later when they want another new truck and use a HELOC to get it.     The biggest issue is this amount of money to them appears to be do whatever we want money and the truth is it is not that much.   I think you/they should discuss their goals besides new house and truck. And as that conversation develops you steer it towards the understanding of not using all of it for Stuff today and sprinkle in the data on lottery winners with much more money going broke.

hm87h53,gritandkisses,11/26/2021,1,Re your last statement: the bank would cut a physical check and send it via usps. If that piece of mail got lost then no one really is at fault here. Your course of action for OP does stand thought. Push the bank harder to determine if the check was cashed. If it truly wasn‚Äôt then cancel the check and recut it. The mail has been running truly abysmally slow so I could see that the landlord would give a month or two leeway or someone they know usually pays a certain way and on time otherwise before they start reaching out about the issue.

Mostly because Im not happy with the investment options my pass companys account had access to but I used it for the match
hm7b4ot,tdp5150,11/26/2021,2,No and 1031 exchange (but you may be too late). There are some big potential ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù in your situation a good CPA will be worth their weight in gold.
hm8jloa,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,Was this your first paycheck?
hm8p4oy,Ok-Grapefruit-1072,11/26/2021,1,I dont know was realism youre talking about because Baltimore isnt that bad. Only some parts of the city are. Plus we have Project Baltimore going on right now to fix the school busses & aid the school system in general. Just dont walk around some arias at night like my cousin did.
hm8fkwx,dizzyforglizzy,11/26/2021,1,Your numbers give me questions. Your income was about $95k and if the home appraised in 2019 (I assume when you bought it) at $350k then to get a $2300 monthly payment on that you either had atypical loan terms really bad credit or a crazy HOA fee or taxes or something. If you put nothing down then that‚Äôs like a 6% interest rate and some taxes and etc in escrow isn‚Äôt it? rates in 2019 were way lower than that.   Never mind all that you‚Äôre saying that ~40% of your income being dedicated to housing is miserably tight in your scenario? 30% is kind of a bench mark but in high cost of living areas or major cityscapes then that number can easily push to 50%. Especially if he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôd have to pay an equivalent amount in rent alone. Also he‚Äôs got a fairly reliable tenant which I know he said he‚Äôs not running numbers. OP is at 30% so is matching the standard.  Honestly the numbers would say you could afford it. Don‚Äôt do anything stupid with the truck and keep saving you‚Äôll grow in to the house assuming your income is reliable. With the tenant then it‚Äôs easy
hm7z1q2,LiteBulb88,11/26/2021,1,You can certainly make an account with Capital One 360 right now. As for cancelling the Wells Fargo account before it opens youll have to call WF to see if theyll let you do that.
hm8s9vk,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,2,Yeah and to be pedantic you must have lived in the house for 2 of the last 5 years and owned the house for 2 of the last 5 years but those dont have to be the same 2 years.  You could have lived in the house for 2 years and then bought the house from your landlord and rented it out for 2 years and then qualify.  Gotta love silly over detailed absurd rules.
hm80w1v,RetireBeforeDeath,11/26/2021,1,You pay income tax (which you pay anyway if you dont put the money into the 401k) and a 10% penalty. But two things.  1. The match return is greater than 10% (the calculus here changes if theres a vesting period on the match). 2. Youre still measuring the expectation value of not needing the withdrawal vs needing the withdrawal. Theres asymmetry here because you cant put money into the 401k next year and expect the same return.  Theres certainly something to be said about the peace of mind of a cash emergency fund. But the match is free money. Theres also questioning what kind of emergency fund it is. The OP has no savings so is it risk of lost job emergency or risk of running out of gas emergency (ok $1500 isnt quite 0 but what kind of buffer does someone need for the less-catastrophic emergencies)?
hm8js6l,CyberSecurityGuy1,11/26/2021,1,3 percent is pretty decent.
hm8qihh,vulcanjedi2814,11/26/2021,-3,Doesn‚Äôt this Jack your credit up?
hm825e7,HarlanCulpepper,11/26/2021,1,You may be eligible for medicaid in your state?  Worth a shot.  Regarding your current bills see if theyll take a lump sum payment  of like $500 and write off the rest.

hm7j8un,benj_frito,11/26/2021,1,She was never married. In terms of significant lifestyle changes I tried to explain how important it is to put in a large amount before the year ends since contributions will reset for next year. I tried explaining that getting a return on the money invested is a very big deal but she wasnt convinced. I dont know what to say to convince her that this will help her immensely in the future.
hm877e5,PotentialAfternoon,11/26/2021,1,Your dad is giving you a sensible advice.  401k match is ‚Äúfree‚Äù money that is accessible many decades from now.   How much to allocated between Cash savings vs investment is a tricky balance and there is never the right answer.    But I would personally consider your dad a wise person based on his advice. Take advantage of 401k match to a point but don‚Äôt over do it at expense of having emergency cash savings
hm7t5f2,CuddlyArachnid,11/26/2021,1,Yes. I did not grow up with money and while I am learning a lot I am sure I am still a financial imbecile in many areas. What is wise?

hm7boul,StingrayRaider,11/26/2021,1,Honestly the sign on bonus for something like Chase Sapphire Preferred will be higher than any amount of points you will spend in years.  Yeah Amex can suck as a lot of places/things don‚Äôt accept it.
hm7r8qj,Potato_hoe,11/26/2021,1,This isn‚Äôt accurate - at least not in my case and everyone I know from college. We worked hard got internships many turned into full time opportunities or found a good starting position after graduation. Yes it‚Äôs true that most people don‚Äôt graduate and immediately make a ton of money but we made more than enough to live a comfortable life. A couple years of experience led to a better opportunity and the next and then the next where I now make a very comfortable salary and my career opportunities and salary will only continue to grow for the rest of my career. People think because they don‚Äôt graduate making 6 figures that college isn‚Äôt worth it and that is absolutely not true. College set me up for success in the long term. I have great benefits and incredible 401k match and a job in a field I love.
hm85rbc,sir_richard_head,11/26/2021,1,Lmao no  OP stands to lose about $1500 over the course os their recovery.  Lawyers working on contingency get 1/3 of the awarded damages.  No lawyer is going to take on a case for $500.  OP is going to be on $700/mo income.  That won‚Äôt even buy two hours of a lawyer‚Äôs time.  Further the employer does not have any obligation to accommodate beyond reasonability.  If there‚Äôs only 15 hours per week of light duty work available then the employer has no obligation to let OP do nothing while on the clock.    Your suggestion is as ridiculous as the lies about your experience with this.
hm7uoga,cballowe,11/26/2021,1,Are you getting quotes for the one on the lot right now or we can order one and you might have it in 3-6 months?  Are you comparing the same trim levels and options? What Ive seen lately is that if you want it now you take the one they have with whatever options its got.
hm6u9rj,blondie401,11/26/2021,2,I would check to see if Filo services the loan or not and decide if you‚Äôre comfortable with them selling it (if they don‚Äôt retain servicing). A lot of people don‚Äôt consider who services their loan when getting a mortgage but it can make a big difference to your experience after your loan closes.
hm6y9kf,reijn,11/26/2021,1,So if hes leaving before December 31st of this year he would owe it by April of 2022?
hm7i6ys,ricedt68,11/26/2021,1,I agree with everyone on here. Get a roommate or two and split the cost. Thats what I did when I was 16 until 19 years old then I went on my own from there on out.
hm8m7o2,touchedbyadouchebag,11/26/2021,1,Look in other places. The Rhode Island market the coastal Connecticut market.  Small Condos in those places can be had under $200k. Pawtucket New London New Haven Bridgeport. Good luck. PS you‚Äôre gonna have to lower your standards for what‚Äôs sustainable for your mom.
hm8tvhu,doneanddead,11/26/2021,93,>  he dumped his future for a one-time insider trade for $50k. $50K to ruin his life for the rest of his existence.  See McKinsey partner buying options in a company he was specifically told he couldnt (and a bunch of other issues.) Threw away a career making *7 figures a year* for a few hundred thousand as a payout.
hm81ram,jimspokane,11/26/2021,1,Unpaid charge off is going to hurt you on a mortgage score resulting in an elevated interest rate or outright decline.  You can got down the debt validation route but that won‚Äôt buy you anything since that process is usually used to slow a collector down or avoid a lawsuit.  At this point you are that Target‚Äôs mercy as to how fast they work with you (or if they work with you at all) to resolve it.  Instead of sending a letter offering a PFD (which they probably won‚Äôt agree to delete that usually only works with third party collectors) why not send them the balance owed in the form of cashiers check and resolve it that way.  You can at least then show a copy to the mortgage underwriter and that may help your case.
hm8hh08,brittyn,11/26/2021,1,Worse could happen if it‚Äôs NOT reported. And the teller could be doing it to other customers too.
hm8b7sj,iponeverything,11/26/2021,1,On a personal level Its good for some for others it others its not. It can be leveraged into plenty of opportunities if you have the right personality though these types of people would do well regardless.  My recommendation would be to keep the positive attitude and keep looking at ways to make your own opportunities and keep the military in your pocket as a backup plan.
hm8iv6h,Annahsbananas,11/26/2021,1,Benefit of the doubt will cost you dearly if youre not careful
hm8q4ky,vulcanjedi2814,11/26/2021,1,You can always dial it back. You won‚Äôt always be able to save more. If the only thing getting in your way is mentally and u don‚Äôt have other things you want or need to do with discretionary funds. Just keep at it.   If you‚Äôre just tying to brag. Well bravo. You‚Äôve earned it.

hm7hn7a,GracieLikesTea,11/26/2021,1,I had a secured card at Capital One when I was rebuilding my credit. At one point I asked them if it could be converted to an unsecured card and they said no they didnt do that. But about a year later they just spontaneously sent me back my deposit as a check and converted the card to unsecured. I still have it and its the oldest line on my credit report.
hm8ehpr,Bduken_2190,11/26/2021,1,Anyone who uses privileged information for their own gain doesn‚Äôt deserve to keep their job. Sounds like you‚Äôre a good person but not everyone is and if he‚Äôs bold enough to reach out to you he‚Äôll definitely do it to someone else.

hm8lo13,dizzyforglizzy,11/26/2021,1,I doubt it even feels uncomfortable unless you intend to save super aggressively and retire early. It‚Äôs probably a safe bet about your friend why not ask him? It‚Äôll feel different and maybe short term like you‚Äôve gone down on your cash flow but the numbers say you can afford it.
hm8hbx3,Err_rrr_rrrr,11/26/2021,1,There is nothing wrong. I suppose I am concern that maybe my parent arent making the most of the properties financially?
hm8ruqf,Dilettantest,11/26/2021,2,Thanks corrected.
hm7vfji,4and2,11/26/2021,1,If you contribute 8% they will contribute 4% but if you only contribute 6% then they only contribute 3%. Thats why they word it that their match depends on how much you contribute.
hm87egk,Fishtale1,11/26/2021,1,I wouldnt say hes hiding the previous damage! He was told by the insurance company he purchased it from that it got hit by a deer and told me the things he replaced on it. Youre correct that the resale value is destroyed which is why I plan to drive it til it needs to be scrapped.   Thank you for your input!
hm88y45,QuitProfessional5437,11/26/2021,1,You would also need to discuss this with your lender. They might make you go through hoops with providing documentation for this
hm82taw,RondaMyLove,11/26/2021,1,Id like to second this. Check out modernstates.org too. They have free online classes to prepare you for clep testing. Theyll also pay for the test. Tons of colleges take these as credits giving you one or two years of free credits plus it will open doors for good online schools like Western Governors which charges under $5000  for a six month semester for as many classes as you can get through in that time.  Theres a story on there right now about a young man who got his associates degree two weeks before he graduated high school then completed his bachelors by 19 and his masters 8 months after that.  Even if you then join the service youll be in much better shape with a degree.  Stay safe.
hm74zr7,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,Are you sure its $35 a day? For 3 days its probably only $35 fee (per transaction). Usually after something like 5-10 days is when they start adding the daily overdraft fee.  Check the terms of your loan what is the penalty for late payment? Is there a grace period?
hm7b2zt,Weggooi987,11/26/2021,1,>Constructive dismissal  thank you for mentioning this I googled it and this might be quite relevant to OP (and interesting to me). And yes we have a similar rule in case of non-payment of wages (and recourse for damages) so I was not complete in my previous post.
hm8mmpj,Least-Love,11/26/2021,1,I have a car with electrical issues that periodically causes the battery to drain‚Ä¶even after replacing the battery it always seemed like the battery was barely strong enough to start the car. I bought a Noco Genius battery charger for about a hundred bucks and I trickle charge the battery overnight about once per month during the winter. It works like a charm.
hm7zrih,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,> Im very pessimistic about current market conditions and think nearly everything is in a bubble but unfortunately I dont have any sound advice as to where to invest to protect against such a bubble bursting  Im not sure how old you are but this has been parroted since 2010. The reality is that no one has a crystal ball but his mother is going to have to take larger risks than most her age in hopes of gathering a nest egg sufficient enough to mean anything.
hm7cnm5,rallyally,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs similar to how this problem has snowballed. All I can see on our employee resource portal is to call one HR number and they obviously can‚Äôt be the one to directly solve this. Sigh
hm8quyj,Sw429,11/26/2021,6,Yes this is a big deal. The teller should at the very least be fired. Its simply not okay.
hm7w7yd,nevermidit,11/26/2021,1,Im not from the US so this is confusing. Why would the bank send physical checks to his land lord. Why wouldnt he just set up auto pay with ebanking and wire him money every month? Or something similar?
hm7534s,heavy_metal_20,11/26/2021,2,My personal email is firstname@lastna.me - at the time I thought it was cool that my last name ended in the same letters as a fairly common domain. Still think its cool but some people try to send emails to firstname@lastna.me.com. xD   Im unaware if my immature youthful cleverness has caused any negative hiring decisions. (Could just be because I dont get any emails sent to the wrong address lol)
hm8pqml,Klarion-X,11/26/2021,88,Perhaps at another location but if there are already significant breaches of privacy like this Im not sure youd want to be so visibly associated with this.

hm7izk8,tastygluecakes,11/26/2021,1,Take a step back first‚Ä¶  What does she want retirement to look like?  Working part time?  Beach in Florida?  Stay in the home she‚Äôs in?  What lifestyle?  How much spending.  Start by determining a target - use one of the many online calculators (better yet do 3-4 of them) to figure out how much she needs to save to get there.  If that isn‚Äôt feasible start figuring out where to compromise: lifestyle or age.    Then based on your timeline and goal you can determine the right risk/reward -> asset allocation
hm8tfc6,kushhcommander,11/26/2021,1,Youre making two assumptions:  One is that the car market will correct it wont.  The vehicle market has changed forever in so many ways.  Every class of vehicle is at its highest markup ever due to supply and demand.  Second is assuming youll take a deprecation hit.  Used cars are up 30% YOY compared to new cars being up 12%.  When you drive off the lot I guarantee you in 3 years you used car you bought new will fetch close to what you paid for it.  Look at the truck market used trucks 3 years old with 40K miles are going for a few thousand less than new.  Yes it is worth it and if he needs a car and is borrowing a car that isnt reliable how much is that worth to him?  Probably a lot.
hm7ey2j,Romex80,11/26/2021,1,Is a cash out refinance an option if the house has been paid off since 1982 as I am not refinancing the house unless you are saying there is not any loan on the house currently and now you are putting one one?   The credit union asked me if I wanted to lock in my rate during phone conversations at the beginning. Fearing variable rates that in my luck would go up more that they would go down I went for the safe option.

hm7ct3t,Pickaa,11/26/2021,1,Not being cashed that on them then. You arent their bookkeeper to also go and run their errands and balance their checkbook. Plus a lot of banks should be copying bank checks to verify their own records to begin with.
hm7gysx,saryiahan,11/26/2021,1,Look into technical colleges. Most offer two year degrees with paid internships that can cover up to half the cost. Once you graduate you should be able to find a job making at least 60k+ a year
hm7971c,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,Yeah they dont have to respond to your complaint. Theoretically they could toss it in the trash.   Filing a Dispute has rules. Filing a CFPB complaint has rules.   But no rules on an internal complaint   Honestly they were probably tired of you calling and they tossed your feedback in the trash.
hm794tj,intern_at_olympus,11/26/2021,2,I joined army at 22 (Infantry) and it interferes with my ability to freelance. It‚Äôs just my personal experience though. You return wired different and there are new doors it opens but also closes others too due to new commitments
hm6srj9,SkiMonkey98,11/26/2021,5,Not if you have a secure job and people are just giving you shit. But if youre applying for new jobs or trying to sell a product and you know people in your field are judging you for that it would be worth making a Gmail account
hm81nqj,dukeofwar149,11/26/2021,1,I personally would pay cash and be done with it yes the interest is low but unless you were putting that money to work somewhere and earning more then that then it doesnt really matter its still costing you money to borrow it.
hm76ou2,Kikutwo,11/26/2021,1,Yeah who needs decades of compounding on free money anyway.
hm8jyos,SpaceFaceMistake,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôd say just put money aside until you find a broker or exchange you want to use.  If you don‚Äôt have investing or trading or any kind of finacial document or accounting or business finance or stockmarket knowledge and or insight then you need to study some. Not all aspects and depends what you want to do. If you want to invest only then using a personal broker is probably best but if you want to you can do it yourself and Broke directly with the exchanges. Cutting out the fees for the brokering service from another person.   However if your not well tuned to the stock market from reading charts to the tech analysis to the economic side to the finacial side to BE ABLE to find new markets regularly that go up and grand solid returns where brokers can and or nice dividends then having a broker can definitely be worth the money/investment as their knowledge will grow your capital and you won‚Äôt feel as many emotions when things go sour or the markets dip for any reason.
hm6toxo,colty31,11/26/2021,1,You could start the conversation by getting a pre-approval at a local bank or credit union. Sounds like you could most likely afford homes in that price range especially if you‚Äôre putting down a large down payment.
hm7n6hf,gettingbetteralways,11/26/2021,0,I mean the example was just funny but the idea that you should auto match is still stupid
hm7v31a,dutchie727,11/26/2021,1,Is it not possible to do both? I wouldnt walk away from the employer contribution. Thats free money..
hm87rxt,iambatmanjoe,11/26/2021,1,So this isnt a direct answer just my own experience. My partner bought her rental about a year before we got married. We discussed waiting but the opportunity popped up and she grabbed it. She used a first time homebuyer program. We moved in together got married then two years later at found another rental I was able to use a first time homebuyer program. So we each own one. Worked out really well. Shes on hers Im on mine. We manage them together
hm88n95,PM_ME_YOUR_CALICOS,11/26/2021,1,Depends on depth. Putting it up on a lift checking fluids frame damage obvious stuff is what I plan to have done and thats $97 with tax and takes roughly 90 minutes. Obviously some depth to take that long.  Id say $100 and two hours is a good monetary and time budget just start contacting places.
hm7ai4b,HittemWithTheLamp,11/26/2021,3,My advice would be join a different branch if you‚Äôre only going to pay for college. Army and Marines have pretty awful quality of life. If you have a clean record and high enough ASVAB join the Air Force or maybe Navy but choose a job in connected to boats.
hm7b3lz,tuxed,11/26/2021,1,Here‚Äôs some guidance: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc153  In short file your taxes ASAP. You may be able to get an exemption for the late filing fee due to your circumstance.
hm8oxgi,PlasticDesk2021,11/26/2021,2,I‚Äôm not even going to read other comments before I reply. YOU have the upper hand. Used cars are selling more than new msrp. Tell your dealer to eat a duck then sell it for $10k more than you owe. Seriously.
hm7ywhs,AzeTheGreat,11/26/2021,1,If it was vested immediately youd still be better off contributing up to the match and then pulling it out and just eating the 10% penalty.  *Unless* you would be able to save enough to max out the match later in the year so youd just be shifting around the timing of things.  Of course thats dependent on how exactly your company implements matching since that would leave match on the table for some plans...  Its always nuanced its *not* just false.
hm8gms7,trueoctopus,11/26/2021,1,Close Reddit and Screenshot EVERYTHING. Your bank app your receipt from that day. The facebook message the facebook profile EVERYTHING!!. Then print it all and bring copies to the bank TOMORROW (if they close for weekends Monday). Be waiting outside when they open and speak to the manager and only the manager. Not a teller or a secretary. In the meantime if this is a big bank Call their CS Line tonight and have them lock all accounts for potential fraud. I hope you have money or credit elsewhere if you go with this option. Legally the teller had no access to your account be technologically he does.
hm8mpzz,loveittodeath,11/26/2021,1,The rule is just a guideline. Most people arent in your situation. If it were me Id start thinking about my personal goals and allocate money from there. Have enough in your savings that you have an emergency fund. Think about other short term savings goals and when youd like to reach them. Decide whether or not you want to increase your personal spending. Invest.
hm8g3gh,NYNBKFarSuperior,11/26/2021,1,its my take home pay after taxes so I think net. My health insurance for the job has not kicked in yet per contract. There is no commuter program. This job normally pays employees hourly but on my offer sheet I negotiated a base pay of 52k so Im thinking thats the issue? Its a new job and they were supposed to send me a pay stub but said it didnt get delivered properly and sent back. I am just wondering how much am I supposed to be making on that amount really before I make it a big thing.
hm844ko,6hooks,11/26/2021,1,Only suggestion you may not fully account for as first time homeowners is the initial furnishing and repair expenses. I DIYed every paint job and repair and still sunk thousands going from a 1000sqft 1br apt to a 950sqft 3br home. Appliances paint furniture etc. Adds up fast.  Something to be on the lookout for

hm7e92o,vaguelyconcerned,11/26/2021,1,Its free money. This is the official order that a majority of financial advisors recommend:  1/ Invest up to 401k employer match (in your case 6% of income)  2/ Emergency savings to cover 3 months expenses in a high yield savings account  3/ High interest debt (credit cards personal loans some private student loans)  4/ Maximum annual 401k contribution (18k for most people)  5/ Low interest debt like federal student loans  6/ Personal investments in IRA or other investment account

hm7e5dk,Just_the_typto,11/26/2021,1,trade the lincoln for something not fancy and cheap and something you dont have to worry about... meaning you dont have to worry if you can afford payments and full coverage insurance and also meaning you dont have to worry about the reliability.  When people come up they tend to spend way more than they should because having nice things makes you feel good but trust me if you get the lowest payments possible for a usable car in your area you will be able to invest in things that you really want. Maybe a house or early retirement?
hm6zq2z,thehawkman22,11/26/2021,14,I agree. USAF is the way to go. I joined with some buddies 20 years ago. I would have never guessed how incredible my life is today back then and it‚Äôs all because of my time in the military. Definitely pick a career field that transitions well into civilian life. Can‚Äôt go wrong in IT. I did four years and got out and took advantage of the VA education benefits. One of my buddies who went in with me just retired after 20 years. He‚Äôs got a military pension and isn‚Äôt even 40yo. I recommend it to everyone who may be a little lost after high school.
hm81x1k,CQME,11/26/2021,1,>Im not sure how old you are but this has been parroted since 2010.  Older than you apparently lol.  I also have to say that most bears in 2010 were quite optimistic.  Most bears were quite pessimistic in 1999 and 2007.  > but his mother is going to have to take larger risks than most her age in hopes of gathering a nest egg sufficient enough to mean anything.  IMHO this is a bad mentality.  As one approaches retirement age one should find comfort in the modest gains one would achieve while their nest egg whatever it may be bears fruit.  This is not the time to be sailing in a hurricane.  You reap what you sow.
hm7o6kl,facerollwiz,11/26/2021,1,I would contribute up to the company match and get a second job 10-15 hours a week for emergency fund and student loan pay down if it‚Äôs that important to do that.
hm8e7na,wheniaminspaced,11/26/2021,1,I guess it depends on what your goals and motivations are and what your father is willing to potentially deal with.  If it were me this is what I would do and the conversation I would have  Dad tax free retirement contributions early in life have the largest return on investment and make saving for retirement a lot easier than contributions further down the road.  Instead of building up cash savings I want to make some early retirement gains to allow for more flexibility later in life.   If I take this route are you comfortable helping me out if my situation changes.  This is an line of thought that can be backed up by many sources.  Early retirement contributions do substantially more to set you up later in life than later contributions to hit the same number starting later requires substantially larger contributions.    That said as most everyone else in this thread has pointed out you currently have effectively no safety net of your own but if your father is comfortable playing the safety net and knows that is what he is doing I would would put every cent I could into retirement savings.  It super easy to cut retirement contributions later in life it is much harder to catch up.  There isnt really a wrong answer here both strategies carry merit.  My last add is this your carrying 3k in monthly expenses that is a lot for a single individual.  You probably can knock that number down and I would try to.

You can contribute a max of 19.5k to 401k per year but only $6k per year to a Roth plus once you you reach $140k modified adjusted gross income you will no longer be able to contribute directly to a ROTH IRA.
hm79pbf,jpv1031,11/26/2021,3,(Full disclosure - Im prior service Air Force)  If youre not looking to be a career soldier and more geared to just putting yourself on the right path for your future you should go Air Force or Navy.  Better quality of living more career oriented opportunities all with the same benefits of the GI Bill and VA loans.  Personally I went Air Force cause I didnt want to be stuck on a ship for months at a time.  I was a 3COx1 - Comm Ops/Computer Operator and it directly translated into my civilian career as I am currently a systems engineer.  Regardless of what branch you decide to go its an experience I will never forget/regret having.  Best of luck with everything!

hm7d5ku,3rdIQ,11/26/2021,1,Kudos for reviewing your financial options and working on a financial plan at your age.  Make sure its a written plan so you can see if your goals are working or make edits as needed.   I would do some research into Traditional IRA verses Roth IRA so you understand the benefits now as well as in the future.  All the major brokerage houses have information for example here is [FIDELITY IRA](https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/ira-comparison) information page.   Compound interest is a very powerful tool and the earlier you start saving for retirement the larger your reward will be.  Even if you feed an IRA with $10/month contributions its better than nothing.

hm6wf8e,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,3,> I have to pay a significant alimony for another few years and child support for over a decade. They feel like deductions from net worth much like a mortgage would be deducted from net worth.  You can use present value formula to get an equivalent pay off amount today. This is a way to pretend your non-debt based obligations as debt.  For example if you have to pay $X per month for N months pick a discount rate r such as inflation or mortgage interest rate and:  PV = payment / (1 + r) + payment / (1 + r)^2 + payment / (1 + r)^3 + ... + payment / (1 + r)^N. This is the same kind of calculation as mortgage credit card debt etc. with the difference that you already know the present value of mortgage/CC debt.
hm780eg,kaijubooper,11/26/2021,1,It depends on the plan - not every plan offers that. The 401k was with Fidelity and my spouse thinks he found that in the plan documents on the Fidelity site. But its been awhile.  When he switched jobs he just had to set up a payment plan directly with Fidelity - I think he had to call to set it up. We made the payments for the remainder of the loan period at least one year from what I remember.

hm8ltad,QuitProfessional5437,11/26/2021,1,Not to rain on your parade but in your current situation you will not be able to get a mortgage. Probably wont for at least 2 years.   You need to get a real job where you pay taxes and you need to start paying your credit card bills. Does your spouse have a green card?  If she does she needs to work on her credit too. She needs to apply for a credit card.  You shouldnt ask your mom to put her as a co-signer. Dont put that burden on her. She needs to get her own credit.

I knew my parents couldn‚Äôt afford for to pay for my tuition at a 4year school and I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I grew up nowhere near the coast but had dated a girl whose cousin was engaged to a guy in the Coast Guard.   It sounded interesting so I decided it was my best option to get out of my hometown experience something new and figure out what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. Plus my college would be paid for afterwards.  Joined in January 2005 did 4 years figured out a direction for my career got out finished college (Post 9/11 GI Bill took affect not long after I got out thankfully) and got into my career.  My time in the Coast Guard was much more difficult than I expected‚Ä¶I was right in the middle of Hurricane Katrina got diagnosed with depression (but great treatment for it for free) and had a shitty commanding officer for a bit. I also realize my experience wasn‚Äôt typical.   If I could redo it all over again though I would have probably tried for the Air Force since there are many more job/MOS options.

hm7okz5,Particular-Earth-453,11/26/2021,1,Is the $230K an actual bid? That sounds astronomical for 900 sqft addition even with a bathroom. If you were building up and had a lot of structural work I could see it being expensive. But if you‚Äôre building off the back of a one story house that doesn‚Äôt add up. Do you have a breakout of the costs? I‚Äôm sure it includes permits architect/construction plans and the actual work. But still. I wouldn‚Äôt add 900 sqft for $230K. Unless you don‚Äôt plan to move ever I guess.   To answer your question yes that amount of money is normal. That‚Äôs how any mortgage works (look up amortization schedule). You‚Äôre essentially taking out a mortgage. 3.5% actually isn‚Äôt bad you might be able to get slightly lower between 3-3.5%.  Estimated cash to close is the wrong term. I think that‚Äôs how much you are getting at closing and they‚Äôre deducting the closing costs from your mortgage amount.

Or just pay it down cash if thats your preference so that you dont have to worry about investing or paying any interest at all...

hm85hlc,AmayaOkami,11/26/2021,1,Ive tried enlisting a few times before. First in the army. I was 17 and still needed parental consent was warned to NEVER sign unless you know for SURE what you are signing up for. Had an ASVAB score of 70. Not the best I dont think but not half bad. They made me wait until EVERYONE picked their jobs first then told me nothing was available and I just had to sign and would be able to pick again before boot camp... Luckily I had family in multiple branches I talked to about it and I told them no. I was berated and intimidated for about an hour before they realized I wouldnt have the consent so was sent home.  Then tried air force after I turned 18. Unfortunately I had JUST gotten a tattoo and was told it would need to be removed before I could enlist. Fuck that! So instead I went the trade route. I got a 2yr degree for medical technology (run all the lab tests Drs order) and my program found the loopholes in my state (FL) to allow me to sit for my 4yr degree license with just a 2yr degree. If military seems like too much of a commitment (though by the sounds of it might be a good route with covering room board and help with paying for college) I highly recommend looking into TRADE schools. HVAC electrical medical technology IT surg tech welding... Its usually less (filler) school cheaper and most guarantee internships/apprenticeship and usually can even guarantee job placements.  Sometimes traditional college isnt for everyone. But its not the ONLY option. I will always support military as a lot of my family have served but Ive personally gone the trade route and am doing what Ive always wanted and even managed to get my bachelor degree without student loans by getting a decent job right out of the gate.  Tldl: check out trade colleges as well. Programs around 2yrs with guaranteed experience and work placement

hm8g15j,KBVan21,11/26/2021,2,My honest thought is he won‚Äôt steal. Simply because he used his social media to contact you. He would have to be a complete fucking imbecile to now steal from you after using his social media to ask you. If he is that stupid then you‚Äôre about to have a field day with him and the bank.   First things first screenshot that social media message so you have proof.   Secondly doesn‚Äôt your bank have 24 hour call centre? At this point it doesn‚Äôt matter which department you call you just want whichever manager is there so you can report this. Get the paper trail started as you want things documented.   Once that‚Äôs done call tomorrow and get the process started for the bank getting their house in order.   The guy likely is just stupid if he is a basic teller who saw your account and though to ask. He may genuinely be in financial hardship which makes people do crazy things but what he has done is so incredibly unethical and likely breaking several privacy laws that both he and your bank are gonna be hurting financially very shortly.
hm7wazh,goodcorn,11/26/2021,1,Im gonna go out on a limb here and say the reason they *cant* confirm if it was cashed is because Chase is terrible and does not give a made fudge about OP.

hm8gpyh,PrincessPilar,11/26/2021,1,There are a lot of issues here:  Does Mom live in your house? Is the car still garaged at your house or elsewhere?  Some policies exclude collision coverage if the vehicle is being driven by a resident that is not listed on the policy.  If she were to get in an accident the insurance company has to speak with you as the policyholder and the owner of the car. Given that you are overseas is this easily done?  The best thing to do would be to add her to the policy as a driver until you come back.
hm8ggyc,LiteBulb88,11/26/2021,1,Be aware its not free:  [https://marketing.bankwithfair.com/](https://marketing.bankwithfair.com/)  Yes a 4% rate of return (if you have $25k+ with them) will outweigh the membership costs but theres no guarantee about how long that 4% rate will last.

The other two bereaus have been fine but when I call Equifax they‚Äôll make me give up pretty much every piece of personal information there is then tell me its unfrozen the lender then will disagree and and says it still is. I honestly think Equifax tries to give horrible service with their free credit freezes to try and get you to pay for their (unnecessarily) credit lock service.
hm7lmxl,Promattic,11/26/2021,1,Dunno of this will help but I work in item processing and when we get our bill pays we still have to key in the correct accounts manually  ask the bank to double check that everything was sent to the correct places. Your account may have been debited but to the wrong account. Happens alot due to human error and even more so now when half the people are working from home will large amounts of lag causing even more human error.
hm85we4,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,Lol I just looked it up. You only owe capital gains taxes when you sell it for more than it‚Äôs worth. And literally nobody buys cars for more then they are worth.

hm6x5og,93195,11/26/2021,2,Net worth means assets.  Alimony and child support are expenses.  While expenses can slow or deplete the accumulation of assets they aren‚Äôt the same thing.  Net worth means assets minus liabilities (debt) as of right now.
hm8ebal,93195,11/26/2021,1,No it really isn‚Äôt.  Bank policy.

hm8eliq,notoriousdnp,11/26/2021,1,Well when they cash it their information is shown so yes that is proof that my landlord cashed it. I hand deliver my check and get a receipt as well. Sometimes they are away and I video myself bringing the check over and save the footage from my dash camera showing I delivered it because I don‚Äôt trust them. If we want to pick this apart nothing is infallible. But I find my way the safest for my situation.
hm8bdt4,statmos,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôm not a tax professional but my understanding is that your parents may still owe a gift tax on the difference between $50 and the fair market value even if the ‚Äúgift‚Äù was given through their company. That being said the lifetime gift tax exemption is several million dollars and the annual reporting threshold is $15k so they probably don‚Äôt owe or need to report anything.   Since this was effectively a gift your cost basis should be equal to the fair market value when you received the car and you only owe capital gains if you sell above that amount.
hm8rrpr,Peemster99,11/26/2021,180,> Maybe because social media makes it so much easier to see?  Oh weird inappropriate stuff happened all of the time before social media but it seldom got told to anyone beyond friends families and coworkers.  This level of sketchiness and weirdness may not have happened in a bank though-- Im pretty sure low-level bank work was a lot further from low-level retail work back in the 90s and this is the kind of thing Id associate with low level retail.
hm80pf1,BHarcade,11/26/2021,1,FASFA applications have a special circumstance clause (which includes abuse) but you need to notify the financial aid office after you fill out the application.

hm8qwm3,Least-Love,11/26/2021,16,I was in a similar situation when I was in college after getting out of the military. I worked  a full-time night shift job went to school full-time during the day and worked a second part-time job on the weekends. I was struggling financially but getting by without taking on debt.   One morning I was driving home from work fell asleep at the wheel and drove my car into a telephone pole. I was ejected from the passenger side window of the vehicle and broke my collar bone shoulder blade and ankle. I also had lacerations on my face and leg that required stitches. I‚Äôm lucky I survived and that I didn‚Äôt kill or injure anyone else. My car was totaled and I was sore for weeks. It was a huge setback. After the accident I quit the weekend job and cut back my course load. It took a bit longer to graduate but it I still graduated debt free.  IMHO your plan may work for a semester or so but something‚Äôs got to give. I don‚Äôt think you should take on additional debt. Maybe cut back your course load and move out your graduation date. It will take longer but life will suck a lot less during that time. You may even want to invest some of your ‚Äúextra‚Äù time to find higher paying jobs or jobs that offer tuition reimbursement.
hm8hif5,clegg2011,11/26/2021,1,That 4 people at chase say they cant tell what happened to the money is garbage. I hope you are able to resolve this matter quickly and then promptly move along to a more thorough and helpful bank.
hm8fe1h,Cejvo7,11/26/2021,1,Right on. I appreciate the advice! I‚Äôll keep doing what I‚Äôm doing then and eventually look at real estate when the market slows
hm8144r,w33dcup,11/26/2021,1,Maybe were saying the same thing. I have 1 account and in that account are 3 investments tracks each with a defined beneficiary 1 for each child.  The ease comes from the kids being different ages and thus on different reallocation schedules.  Since they each have their own track I dont have to log in at any point to change anything.  I just automated a monthly xfer to the account and let it ride.

hm814y0,teresajs,11/26/2021,1,Youll want separate accounts for separate children.  You cant withdraw the funds for multiple children from the same account in the same year without incurring some penalties (cant have multiple beneficiaries). If there is overlap in their education years or different kids spend different amounts in college (and maybe youll allow the child who saved money to spend their excess) youll be better off with separate accounts.  Im not sure that you can split an account and roll partial account balances into other accounts.  Keep the current 529 stop further contributions if its fully funded open a new account and fund it for the second child.

hm73pf6,nothlit,11/26/2021,5,Yes it is possible. At a minimum this would probably involve registering a DBA (doing business as alias or trade name) or some other type of corporate entity such as an LLC. You could then set up the business bank account in that name.

Maybe the next mark will be an old person who thinks anyone who works for the bank must be trustworthy and gets talked out of more then they can afford. Or maybe he‚Äôll escalate to showing up at people‚Äôs houses. Someone who is willing to use customers personal information like this has proven they should not be working at a bank.

hm8gils,3rdIQ,11/26/2021,1,Do some research on mutual funds which are basically a group of individual securities (stocks bonds etc.) that are managed and can be purchased without a huge minimum. They are appealing because a funds holdings might include several stocks you are interested in they are easy to buy and mutual funds have diversity.  Mutuals will publish their top 10 holdings and a summary of their objectives.   For example I have a mutual fund that owns stocks from Facebook Amazon Apple Microsoft Google and Tesla and many others.

hm84yrw,ProPainful,11/26/2021,1,Start an roth ira start a 401k yes both. Set up automatic payments to both doesnt have to be huge amounts since youre recurring investing but remember youre savong for retirement in both. anything left over halve it and save half of that / invest the other half in whatever you fancy or do 75 / 25 whatever youre comfortable with investing.   Anything left after that let it sit in your account to double over into your next saving round or use for whatever.
hm78sm3,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,For a first credit card Discover It is a very good choice it is similar to Freedom Flex. Citi & Chase dont have good approval odds for a 1st card.

hm8tfj7,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,The comprehensive/collision is a question of cost vs vehicle value.  If you have a 2021 luxury/sports car thats paid off you should definitely have max coverage.  If you have a 1987 Subaru it might be more beneficial to opt for liability only.  If you add a second driver your rates will go up.  Generally speaking you can add anyone to your policy.  Your vehicle will only be covered for comprehensive/collision regardless of who is driving it if you have those policies.  Liability insurance is for the operator and legally required by each person to drive on public roads.  Does your mother have insurance of her own?  If the answer is no then you know what should be done.  If the answer is yes then why not add your car to her policy and cancel yours saving $700+/year.  Its easy to make up a simple lease contract.  Sell the car to mom for $1/month for 2 years (or however long you will be gone) then transfer the title to her putting yourself as the lienholder.  Realistically you shouldnt be paying for liability on a vehicle you dont drive.  I often had both summer and winter vehicles and seasonal storage insurance was around $10/m for my second vehicle.  This is what you should be paying for.
hm7x747,Tako-Jerome,11/26/2021,1,Mental health therapist here - I realize this is all highly contingent upon somebody being open to it but for what its worth hoarding is a form of obsessive compulsive disorder the gold standard of treatment for which is called exposure response prevention.    If she qualifies for Medicaid you may be able to help her find an intensive outpatient mental health program by calling 211 in your area. Make sure you specify that you want mental health IOP and not substance abuse IOP.  In general finding a clinician in case worker through a community mental health agency is going to be one of your strongest allies going forward because social workers at the hospital will not do extensive follow-up once she is discharged.

hm712e9,ductoid,11/26/2021,1,You make it sound like no big deal but I wouldnt want to live with tinnitus or back pain. (I did have plantar fasciitis for a year but I recovered from that.)  Id rather just work an extra year while young and living with a relative for free and bank the income for tuition than do that.  Me I was on a military base in Germany in the 80s and so was potentially exposed to mad cow disease and the army never even did me the basic courtesy of notifying me I only know from being rejected from donating blood. And so then I lived for a few decades with the knowledge that I might have a dormant brain disease that would make me go psychotic at some point and then kill me. Now theyve determined thats no longer a risk (?) but even without symptoms or a diagnosis ... just the knowledge that I might have it and it could pop up decades after exposure and resentment over how the military treats it as not our problem caused a lot of stress.   That makes me pretty edgy over the mental and physical risks of being in the military how they react to it and like I said elsewhere the implications of how that plays out during a pandemic. I mean we get called to man covid wards when nobody else will accept the risk. Were always going to be expendable.

I can see leaving the student debt alone and pay that off over time or with a bonus you might get. $1500 is not enough in savings to carry you through a rough time (lay off medical expense emergency travel etc).

Because Roth 401k isn‚Äôt an option I do traditional 401k at this hypothetical new job. My next job offers a Roth IRA as an option.

hm7wwwy,1nd3x,11/26/2021,1,individuals Mileage may Vary but my experience with the military (especially on exercises/at home training) is for you to do your best...cuz thats all they can really ask for  They will **ABSOLUTELY** push you and push you hard....there is the standard that you have to meet and they will push you to go as far past it as they can get you to. but...ultimately how far **you** go is up to **you**  If the standard you must meet is doing 25 pushups they will push you to do 30...35...40...45...........100....  If youre done at 30...youre done at 30...you dont **need** to break yourself they are simply trying to show you that your pre-conceived limits may not actually be your limit.  The trick is knowing that you as an individual can and will get better...so...you had better get better. If you can do 30 pushups today...I expect you to be able to do 31 next week...  Also...if youre done at 30 but you arent collapsing exhausted you arent done...I dont care if you actually *are* exhausted at least **act** exausted. done is at your limit pushing too far past your limit is how you get hurt.
hm7r788,wild_b_cat,11/26/2021,1,Thats your withholding not your taxes. Its what your company *thinks* youll need to pay in taxes which suggests you havent filled out your W-4 correctly.

hm8haw9,LiteBulb88,11/26/2021,1,Do you have a 401(k) or similar available at work? If so you cant contribute pre-tax money to a traditional IRA as your income is too high.  In any case I would definitely max the Roth this year since you can.

The market has been doing so well Ive basically been living off my profits. Im going to start taking my social security retirement benefit in Jan 2022. Ill probably drop my IRA withdrawals to 1 or 2 a year.

hm75dy2,Varathien,11/26/2021,1,The consolidation loan makes sense as long as it reduces all the interest rates youre currently paying. (If you have a few cards with really low APRs do NOT pay those off with the loan.)   It probably doesnt make sense to build up a big savings account when you have 19% APR debt or even 11% APR debt. Focus on paying off the debt first THEN save and invest.
hm7ewa3,Sjetware,11/26/2021,1,I work in banking. There are two main methods for Bill Pay systems good funds and risk based models. In a good funds model the bank debits your account by the amount of the check and holds onto it such that any check they have the bill pay provider write has the funds guaranteed to clear.   Other models issue the check and wait for it to be cashed to withdraw the funds assuming the debit to be covered by the member. You could technically spend the money that the bill pay provider sent a check for and then the bank is on the hook to honor the check / recover the funds from you at that time. Its a risk based model the bank doesnt have to hold onto the funds and deal with the oversight of it.
hm7can2,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,No need to hire a CPA :) and yes! you should definitely start contributing to the 401k as soon as you can I would just put the amount the employer is matching so ask what % they match and start with that.
hm8cdkb,6553321,11/26/2021,1,If the check was in the correct amount named to the correct party makes to the correct address doesnt type responsibility end there? If the check was cashed isnt that the end of it far as you are concerned?   Your lease agreement probably lists allowed forms of payment which should include check sent to a given address.  I would let them know Im sorry to hear that and here is everything you can provide to help them in using the police report. To reach out to you if there is anything else you can do to help. Also all them if they want you to issue a stop check let them know what the amount for that would be and that youd take it out of the replacement check you file.   As far as I can tell they have no leg to stand on so you should be active. Although if there is a tenants union or something I would sell legal advice from them.

hm79k0p,Birdy_Cephon_Altera,11/26/2021,2,> Chase said the funds would have been returned if it wasnt cashed within 90 days.  This is the part that I doubt - I suspect OP is getting bad info from an ill-informed Chase rep on this.  Fairly sure funds do NOT return back to the account if it is not cashed.  OP is going to have to request a stop payment on the cashiers check (which can only be done after 90 days have passed since the cashiers check was issued and that amount of time has passed.)
hm8f42e,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,A car purchase is not an investment since the value of cars depreciate. So you don‚Äôt even know what the hell you‚Äôre talking about. Also homeowners aren‚Äôt charged capital gains taxes if they sell two or more years after purchasing the house and it being their primary residence the whole time. Only investment properties are charged capital gains taxes.

hm7m7iv,skinnedalmond,11/26/2021,1,Thanks so much! This is really helpful. I think a Roth IRA will be best for him but maybe some in a traditional IRA wouldn‚Äôt hurt too. If he goes the traditional IRA route how is the income tax on distribution calculated? Is it based on his income from SS and his pension?   I didn‚Äôt think about social security I will check that out.
hm87fob,polar_nopposite,11/26/2021,1,The worth as your describing is irrelevant. The worth is the price paid.
hm8l0ax,trmoore87,11/26/2021,1,Would it be better to max 401k or just contribute to get the match since we have lots of student loans to pay off? I‚Äôve been going back and forth on this daily lately. Analysis paralysis for sure.  I‚Äôm also not sure that we could financially afford to max our 401ks and contribute $12k to Roth IRA. I am planning on fully funding our HSA.
hm8amhx,Undertakerfan84,11/26/2021,1,Yep pretty much the same thing happened to me with BofA too. My current credit union only debits when the check is actually cashed much better that way.

hm7zl3g,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,1,> can I call my bank for a chargeback because they keep avoiding me as well as not wanting to replace the mouse.  Sure you can.  The bank will ask you your side of events.   You may receive provisional credit.   Bank will ask merchants side of events/terms/etc  Bank will then make a decision.  Either reverse the provisional credit or make it permanent.  Either way chargeback does not mean cease working with the merchant.  Bank will ask to be updated as to your progress.
hm7zui6,teefdoll,11/26/2021,1,Well Im a baker. The job description has lifting 30/50 pounds but the only thing I cant do is put things in/out of the oven. Or pull things off the rack. Basically everything else I can do.. so I dont know if that changes anything.
hm8opm4,Nagisan,11/26/2021,2,I follow the 50/30/20 rule...I also dont spend 50% on bills/needs.    Instead its probably closer to 40/30/30 for me.    I use it as a general rule of what to not exceed for my needs and the wants/savings adjust however I please after the needs are met. So if like me you arent spending 50% on needs the leftover goes to wants/savings however you choose to spend it.

hm78ads,mobappbrowse,11/26/2021,1,>	Ironic that their mother and I could get dinged for just trying to be responsible with the money and make sure their college is taken care of from this tragedy (vs just spend the money on normal raising the kid stuff like groceries clothes typical daily expenses).  Except you‚Äôre trying to prescribe what the child can spend the money on.  They may decide to go a different path. It‚Äôs not up to you to decide what the child must do with the money after they turn 18.   If you can put the money in a custodial account and invest. The benefits of a 529 aren‚Äôt that great that it‚Äôs worth legal wrangling when they come of age.
hm8jdgt,Annahsbananas,11/26/2021,1,A banker who has access to personal finance information messaging the guy on Facebook asking for money.  There is no silver lining to this. This is gross negligence and an action that does not get a warning or a write up.

hm81cxd,GreedyNovel,11/26/2021,1,Youll likely be fine. The IRS is very easy to work with they just want to be sure they collect any money owed.  The good news is that if you didnt make very much money (and it doesnt sound like you did) you might not owe much if anything at all. And penalties are based on a percentage of tax owed so if you owe nothing the penalty is nothing.
hm8lg4m,JhihnX,11/26/2021,1,Sounds similar to me. You can‚Äôt scrape enough money to make payments when you get your next disbursement?
hm78kqy,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,6,No. The bank expects the account owner and authorized user to be family members and live in the same place. Its on the account owner to tell the AU.  > but I called the bank just now and they said in the event of her death I would be liable for any balance remaining on the card  Theyre wrong. But AU account could still affect your credit reports so you should get yourself removed if things start to go bad on the account.
hm7skin,93195,11/26/2021,1,If you‚Äôve got multiple quotes the lowest one is the current ‚Äúfair market price‚Äù.  That said it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a particularly low price just the fair market price right now.
hm6ugf6,Ok_Basis_7059,11/26/2021,1,Just because there‚Äôs an estimate doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs not a total loss. It will depend on the value of the vehicle. I believe most insurance companies will total a vehicle if the estimate is around 70% if the value.  To see what your car‚Äôs value is I would just look up what they‚Äôre going for in your area. You can look on cargurus.com or whatever used vehicle website you prefer. Just be sure to look up your year/make/model and as close to the same mileage as you can find. I‚Äôm sure you can find outliers so I‚Äôd just take the average of 3-4 of them and go from there.
hm87qtr,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,Yes 2021 was a wild year for the dependant care tax credit and totally flipped the script. So far there is no talk of extending that into 2022.
hm82czm,iced_out_pickle,11/26/2021,1,Let me tell ya if you can get your SO to use YNAB your life becomes so much easier. Were not going to combine finances until after the wedding so we have our own personal bank accounts and then a joint one to pay split bills out of that we set up recurring transfers from personal>joint every month.    Rent and utilities gets pulled right from the joint and we each have a debit card to use for groceries date night etc. Every other week we sit down and make sure  our joint budget matches in YNAB used to take like 45 mins but now were on the same page and it often takes like 5mins. Its only going to get easier when we combine finances and share one YNAB account after we get married haha

hm6sfjq,wild_b_cat,11/26/2021,1,Still unnecessary for the most part. Possibly down the road when you have large balances in both accounts you can start thinking about tax efficient placement. There are actually different theories on how best to do that.  But it doesnt sound like youre there right now.
hm70067,PetraLoseIt,11/26/2021,2,Im glad to see that his pensioen will be 4480/month.   I think hell also have social security. Check that out on the official website how much thatll be: [here](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/calculators/)  If youd add those two up he might already be where he wants to be when retired.  However of course: saving up some more money is better!  Personally Id have him look into opening a Roth IRA or traditional IRA with Vanguard Fidelity or Charles Schwab and then have him invest in the target date index fund for the year 2030. Because the target date is not that far away they wont risk too much of his investments but he will have *some* stocks in there to also have a chance of growth. He might actually retire in 2027 or so but its still okay that the money is in a 2030 fund even when he is already retired.   If he choses the traditional IRA it means that hell pay less income tax now but will need to pay income tax on the distributions when hes retired. If he choses the Roth IRA it means that hell pay the normal amount of income tax now but of the aftertax money that he puts into the Roth IRA he wont have to pay taxes on the distributions (and also not on any gains made within the Roth IRA).  Either is good (and in fact he can also choose to open both types of accounts and put a bit of money in both) and so they each have their own tax advantages its more the question of which one he thinks will save him the most tax dollars over his life.

hm78oh4,ahj3939,11/26/2021,2,You should get into a rehabilitation plan where you make a few income based payments and they are transferred back to student loan servicing. Since you ignored them for so long there will be nothing negative on your credit reports related to them.  https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/default/get-out  On your mortgage application it will ask you several questions such as outstanding debts such as student loans as well as are you currently delinquent or in default on a federal debt They can verify this though the Treasury Debt Management Services.

hm7hos2,DetN8,11/26/2021,1,If a landlord isnt set up to receive auto payment via EFT (or see below*) you can still set it up with your bank to where they literally mail a check every month.  *One place I was living used to take EFT at no charge. Then they changed management to where they started charging a convenience fee for EFT and card payment. I refuse to pay that so I set up the check mailing thing. At that point I paid water to them separately. At some point they combined the payment and it was a different amount every month so I would walk to the office have them calculate my bill (I could see it if I used their app but I wasnt going to do that) and write them a check right there. Then they got all confused when I asked for a receipt.

Might be misinterpreting what you‚Äôre saying though.  I‚Äôm pro having one account per child there are a couple of good reasons. 1 it‚Äôs going to be a lot easier to manage if your children will receiving distributions from the funds at the same time. 2 many parents opt to use target date funds so with two accounts you can have different risk levels depending on your timeline. 3 if you ever wanted to contribute more than $15k in a single year you can avoid gift tax by contributing to multiple accounts.

I used nerdwallet so lazy assessment but:  4% .54 M  6% .74M  8% 1.04M  And finally 12% 1.49M   Now 6% when your 28 drops you down to 1.13M all other things being equal   https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/retirement-calculator  Needless to say.. do the match

You are super close to having yourself on really solid footing and being able to stretch to new goals‚Äîjust have to finish getting rid of the debt and getting used to your new budget. I use my bonus for nice-to-haves every year like a powder room update vacation fund throwing into 529s. Just because you never know‚ÄîI did get a full bonus in 2020 for example but I know a lot of people my age who were used to bonuses and budgeted using them who didn‚Äôt get one. Just solidified in my mind the idea of setting your spending habits on your base only.   I didn‚Äôt have a job with a big bonus until I already had an emergency fund established but that seems like a great way to knock it out.  All that said‚Äîmoney doesn‚Äôt have to be all or nothing. Have a line in your budget for a little fun spending too.
hm8rt2v,diatho,11/26/2021,2,Traditional homes generate their value from two items the physical house and the land.   A mobile home placed on rented land only gains value from the home.  The mobile part of these homes is largely overstated. Once put in place they are difficult and expensive to move so youre trapped. You need to keep paying rent on land which will go up.    A mobile home on land you own will gain value from both. If you go to sell the home may not have much value but the land will.   Additionally you cannot get a traditional mortgage for these homes and have to get specialized loans.   https://youtu.be/jCC8fPQOaxU thats another good video to watch.   As an investment its not great. If you own the land and the home then its an ok option for a place to live. And if it keeps your costs low you have an asset you can sell (the land) and free cash for investing.

hm6sjfw,Gesha24,11/26/2021,2,Bonus is not something that you should count on when budgeting. I would budget based on how much you take home each month. See how much you can afford of monthly payments. Then go to calculator and see how much of a car you can afford with down payment (make sure you have accounted for taxes and about $500 worth of registration fees whatever else sales guy add on it).  Once you have the number - look around what you can buy for it. Right now market is terrible and most of cars outside of premium segment are overpriced. If you find something you like - you buy it. If not - you wait for bonus so you can make bigger down payment or for better market so that cheap cars are cheaper.
hm8d4ea,bpt1047,11/26/2021,1,I personally dont think its bad advice just a different viewpoint. Different people are at different stages in life and prioritize different things. Some say you may be throwing free money away by not getting the match. But then youre not getting the most out of your paycheck to pay off loans or increase savings.  I think what you have is a good balance but it really depends on your budget and how much you have left over after your goals. If you end up with $200 extra every month then increase your 401k contribution. If you end up on the tighter side leave it where its at and get rid of those student loans ASAP after your e-fund is established and comfortable for your needs.

hm7g73z,vrtigo1,11/26/2021,1,I always ask for a ticket number and when I can expect a response.  Also Id ask what their ticket process is.   I.E. they fill out a ticket what happens from there?  What party is responsible to take the next action and how can you follow up with them.  Basically just dont give them an excuse to brush you off like they seem to be doing.  If they cant give you an ETA on when youre going to be paid Id tell them thats unacceptable and demand to speak to a supervisor.  Keep going up the chain.  If you have to tell them youre going to reach out to the state labor board and/or an employment attorney.  Hate to burn bridges but if an employer is not treating an employee not being paid as an urgent issue that is a huge problem.

No need for me to go in at age X and reallocate.    Now say my kids dont use all the money.  Cool then I can use it myself in retirement for some qualifying classes.  Or I can just sit on it until grandkids are ready. Thinking creatively with these accounts can help with asset/wealth creation for generations to come.

hm8h3hr,sf_torquatus,11/26/2021,1,It would be nice if the police figure out the drivers identity but thats not usually the case. What most people in this situation experience is having to go through their own insurance...and lose some faith in humanity.  If I were in your shoes I would use your uninsured motorist coverage. If the car is totaled then the adjuster will cut you a check. If its virtual then you may get the money within a business day otherwise youll have to wait for the in-person appointment. If your car isnt totaled then add a few more weeks for the body shop to fix it.  Either way if (big if) they find the driver then the insurance company will go after them.  Also if the car is totaled then the check should be the fair market value not the cost of a replacement. Youll still have to get another car and then pay the sticker price along with the tax title licensing dealership fees (if applicable) and the potential increase in insurance rates. All this is to say that you will end up in less car than you were previously driving unless you put in money of your own (note that this is a perfectly acceptable use of some emergency money).  I hope the cops find them. And though it sucks all around we can all be thankful that youre not seriously injured.

hm70c5n,Duc748s,11/26/2021,1,Keep the house for now. Your monthly expenses are low vs renting in the market (or buying) today. Concentrate on upping your marketability in terms of trade/skills/$pr hour and save as much as you comfortably can. Look into Trad/community college/certs to keep education expenses low and once you reach where you want to be job/pay wise decide your next move if you want (or at that point keep the house and rent it out as a LCOL area is good for retiring especially if you have a nice lot/acreage)

hm7l1zc,ReluctantLawyer,11/26/2021,1,They might be driving expensive cars at a huge financial risk elsewhere. People can have lots of nice things on the outside but be in a really precarious position that could tumble easily. I *totally* get the pressure to have something nicer when everyone else does and the desire to reward yourself for hard work and get a nice car to enjoy. Those aren‚Äôt small things to deal with or easily dismissed. However your overall financial picture and your family‚Äôs financial future is way more important. Look at the long game and set yourself up for success over the decades to come now.   You‚Äôve gotten a lot of great advice here. But take a close look at what you‚Äôre getting with new vs used. In the last year a lot of people have reported selling used cars for what they paid for them new. There‚Äôs a lot of demand and not much supply so you might not get a much better deal by buying used whereas a new car might have much better financing terms and a great warranty. There‚Äôs a lot to consider! Good luck.

hm8gke1,Orangesunset98,11/26/2021,1,Again employers sometimes take out even more and if you have health insurance its not taking that into account. Thats a baseline but with a higher income there is a higher tax bracket you need to achieve employers overcompensate
hm78w36,Birdy_Cephon_Altera,11/26/2021,3,Based on what you wrote seems like the payment was sent as a physical payment (like a bill payment cashiers check) but was either never received by the recipient or was received but never deposited.  Money is deducted from your account the moment the cashiers check is created as if you had purchased a money order for example.   Some banks deduct immediately once payment is sent out some banks only deduct once the check is *cashed*.  Seems like Chase is one that deducts immediately (the bank I work for does it this way too).    Generally speaking uncashed cashiers checks dont just automatically have funds return back to your account if the check is not cashed.  You have to make a stop payment request to have the funds returned.      Since the recipient didnt receive the check in the mail (or did receive it and lost it well never know for sure) the next step would be to 1) call a Chase representative and request a stop payment on that lost check so the funds can be returned back into your account.  You can then 2) arrange payment options with the recipient to pay for the lost check - either by re-sending the payment or making a payment through other means.

hm7gphh,wlee233,11/26/2021,1,but you need to determine whether they pay out the match each pay period or pay out the match as a lump sum based on your total contributed throughout the year. if they pay as a lump sum you could set your contribution to the highest allowable by the plan like 70% for example just to make sure you contribute enough before year end to receive the full match

hm6vsea,wrob,11/26/2021,-7,I dont think I would do anything really. As far as youre concerned the landlord lost the check that you sent them. Sounds like their problem. Send summarizing everything along with proof that the rent was sent so that you have a record of everything. Ask them to show you proof that they didnt receive the money and tell them to follow up with their bank to track it down.   Basically the burden of proof is on the landlord that they didnt just lose your check.   The landlord doesnt have a lot of recourse other than trying to evict you which you could pretty easily fight. Theyll probably try to withhold your deposit but there should be a resource to fight that also.   Im not saying to go pick and fight with them. And if they do try to evict you then that wont be fun if if youre in the right but also this isnt 100% on you. Make the landlord do some work. Theres a very good chance they just drop it if you convince them that they wouldnt win in a fight.

hm78kee,GarfieldDaCat,11/26/2021,1,My 401k is a bit low because I didnt start contributing until recently as I wanted to completely pay off my student loans ASAP.   I am currently putting about 8% into retirement. A bit on the lower side but I want to be a bit riskier in terms of my investing since I am so young. (crypto)
hm7kj9j,Econ0mist,11/26/2021,1,OK so she wont be eligible for any Social Security spousal or survivor benefits. She should create an account at ssa.gov and plug the numbers into opensocialsecurity.com to understand her projected Social Security retirement benefits.   Getting a return on investments is important but because she has a relatively short time left to save its more important that she focus on saving as much as possible.   You might want to put together a simple spreadsheet that assumes a 4-5% rate of return (balanced portfolio) and shows how much saving $x per month turns into at age 70.  Also its possible that she will be better off with a Traditional IRA where she can take a tax deduction for contributing. If she will have no other income sources in retirement she can withdraw some of the pretax Traditional IRA money in the 0% tax bracket locking in the tax savings.  You also asked about investment allocation. I think any balanced fund or target retirement index fund is fine. She might also need to explore single premium immediate annuities (SPIA) later in life to obtain a higher payout than an investment portfolio can generate.
hm73uuq,parkinsonblack,11/26/2021,1,This is great thanks for the help!
hm6sn09,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,2,One trick is to learn to self soothe so you can suffer during the delay part of delayed gratification.   Many not great things we do are really our way of getting a new feeling. Like some people go to bakery for a cupcake and others go to get a new feeling....  Anways start by making a list of 10 things you can do to self soothe. Prioritize the list. Keep a written copy and a digital one on your phone. When the impulse to veer off track becomes an urge get the list. Start at #1. Do it for 10 minutes. Reevaluate. Is it working? Then keep doing it! Not so much? Move on to #2. Rinse repeat until the feelings are manageable again. At a later date when things are good do an after action report so to speak. What worked? How well? What didnt.  If ut didnt work  toss it. Replace it with something new to try. Now reorder the list accordingly. Rinse repeat until you have not only a tried and true go to list but a habit.   A regular mantra is I can do hard things. Or I do hard things.   The key to successfully delaying gratification is being able to suffer better. The ability to self soothe and distraction is where the better part comes in.
hm8aw5l,fredinNH,11/26/2021,1,You are right I was wrong. I had to call Toyota credit about my loan and I mentioned that I didn‚Äôt know Toyota was involved with Mazda. The rep I talked to said Toyota owned Mazda. She was wrong and I repeated her wrong.
hm82t1v,MakeItHomemade,11/26/2021,1,On that salary 27k debt is nothing.   Pay that off then move into the high rent.    You can afford it.    Is it the smartest financial idea. Nope.
hm7t8h2,Roxerz,11/26/2021,1,I cant say Army from experience but I did 4 years in the USAF. Best decision of my life. Did it in 2009 towards the end of the housing crisis and was 23 at the time failing community College with $13k+ debt. I ended up as a contract specialist (6C0) and they offered me a $90k reenlistment bonus. I didnt take it as I wanted to go be a full time poker pro. Family asked me to finish college and I did using post 9/11 GI bill. Veteran preference along with good grades a bunch of recommendation letters from commanders and professors got me my first job out of college. I now work for the govt where my military time can be transferred towards retirement and am on track to be GS-13 making 6 figures (I already do with other passive income). If I didnt go to the military my life wouldnt have accelerated as fast as it did. I was always better and brighter than most people but I was poor and wasnt raised with any guidance so I never got to see my full potential. I could do so much more than I do now but Im happy with my job and family.  Of course I know some army guys who hate the military after they get out. Everyone is different and all branches are tougher in culture than the AF but the AF gave me the tools and guidance to get to where I am now. I seriously couldve gone down a dark path. Poverty and bad neighborhoods will guide you into desperate situations. A lot of my friends were drug users and dealers.

Were not doing posts about luxury products expensive cars etc. anymore because (a) they generally just provoke unproductive discussions and (b) most of the time it is very clear whether the person asking is able to afford the item.  1. If you are considering buying an expensive car the [vehicles wiki](/r/personalfinance/wiki/vehicles) has budgeting advice. We recommend reading it. If you dont meet 100% of the criteria then no you cannot afford it and you should not buy it.  2. In general if youre not on step 6 in [How to handle $](/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) you should find a less expensive alternative to a luxury product.

hm82kcy,redapoluza,11/26/2021,1,I honestly have no idea with the rust. It didnt notice it as abnormal until a few months into the purchase unfortunately. But Ive had several trips to the mechanic for crap just falling off while im driving. Today i had them do a full inspection and had them show me about 3k worth of stuff that is the process of failure.   He said its rare to see it get so bad that early but it happens. I live in the midwest & rust is kinda just a way of life down here. Probably gonna look into treating my next vehicle for it.   I am thinking of just trading it in but unless i find a great offer somewhere im looking at a 4-5k loss. Thats without doing repairs. Would 3k of repairs give me more than 3k in extra trade in? Im doubting it. But yea i am kindof shot of the thing.
hm8fu5u,Gromle81,11/26/2021,1,I can just write what ever message I want in the transfers. Its either a message or an id-number for that transaction. Its really odd that check are free but wireless transfers costs money.
hm7k5oy,widowmaker28A,11/26/2021,1,Pay for it upfront. All college loans will suck you dry in the long run. Better to start a career after college in the black then 40K in the red.
hm8g8mg,zhonzhon,11/26/2021,1,In general yes.  But it depends on contract specifics.  But they can also withdraw the offer.  Or you can quit before even starting.
hm87tqu,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,400 a month turns out to be 4800 invested a year.  Seems better to average in by spending 100 every Monday rather than dropping 3000 in at once.  Upon checking VTSAX is 235 and you said I have to buy a whole share so I guess buying one share a month and 3 VTIAX a month brings me to 400ish.  I wish I could just set it and forget it.  I‚Äôll look and see if I can find a way to do 100 every week maybe under another ticker? I‚Äôm new to this stuff.   Thanks for those links I‚Äôm gonna read them.
hm7714w,Sinsyxx,11/26/2021,1,Your da is actually right in a sense. From a financial planning perspective you shouldn‚Äôt be investing until you have an emergency savings fund. That said the best option is to up your contribution to match and increase your savings at the same time. You‚Äôre young and with a good income should be able to do both. Don‚Äôt worry about the student loans.
hm7hgau,interstat,11/26/2021,1,Yea for sure.  Weve been fortunate to be living mostly in the rural areas of USA. Cost of living is so much lower than my family living back in japan  Having a job that paid for all meals a 150 dollar a month room rent in bumble fuck Tennessee set us up good for the future. If I was spending 3400 for an apartment in Tokyo like my brother was Id have had zero savings
hm84z38,PutinBoomedMe,11/26/2021,1,There is. I consider myself highly educated but I didnt know a child could defer their 10 year period until they become 18. Even more reason for OP to roll to the inherited IRA and push it off until later
hm7tbsf,HolyGig,11/26/2021,1,There is a point in life where you go from thinking money is the most important asset to realize that time is your most important asset. In a lot of ways they are even the same thing but while you can trade time for money you can never trade money for more time no matter how rich you are.  You cant really be saving too much unless you are letting it impact or be detrimental to your current lifestyle. Saving is good but dont get addicted to it and make sure you are spending some money now to enjoy your life.
hm83qnu,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,Yes it most definitely does factor into capital gains tax. If you sell an item for more then you paid for it the gains are taxable.
hm7iasu,DetN8,11/26/2021,1,Its not withdrawn until the check is cashed. If its very important to someone to not incur late fees they should write the check hand it to the landlord and request receipt of payment doing so well before its due.
hm8mlqe,Immediate-Joke8605,11/26/2021,1,Ok.. so how come IRA account generate capital gain? Is that like mutual fund? Can I choose fund by depositing money or does bank choose for me?  Or stepping back.. is that just checking account? I‚Äôm sorry for ignorance
hm6wfzg,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,So what is your goal? To avoid MI taxes? Or just pay the minimum?
hm8fmmx,Sarkir,11/26/2021,1,Notify the bank of the employee‚Äôs behavior. If the employee steals from your account the bank will be responsible for the theft and replace the funds. I think at most you have to worry about inconvenience. In most systems it would be nearly impossible for a teller to get away with stealing from a random customer account especially if you are looking after the account.
hm8cfae,tdp5150,11/26/2021,1,That‚Äôs stretching it a bit for sure. Good rule of thumb is shoot for a mortgage balance of no more than 3x your income anything beyond that starts to get iffy (but not impossible). Particularly because you don‚Äôt have all that much cash saved up in case SHTF.
hm8dxtp,Fresh-Lynx-3564,11/26/2021,1,I would move my $ to another bank first and than report and show the screenshot. Just to be safe. It‚Äôs much harder to get $ back even with evidence. And hopefully the bank do better compliance training with their employees.
hm6u2dc,colty31,11/26/2021,4,You need to have this conversation with your insurance company. Your car was probably worth $27-$30K so you‚Äôre correct that the $20K estimate means it‚Äôs not totaled.  I would be very uncomfortable having that much work done on a car what exactly was damaged? Is it just cosmetic stuff? Engine? Axels?
hm7e6z2,lstac936,11/26/2021,1,Thanks I never knew that.
hm8h3uw,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,I mean Ive added hundreds of drivers to policies and seen the rates go down.  Personally I have never seen a policy go up when there were more drivers then vehicles and the added driver had no activity and was in a lower risk sex/age group.    Generally speaking cars are rated for not drivers.  But the rate for the car is modified by the driver/drivers assigned to it.  If multiple drivers are assigned to the car either the more expensive driver is rated for or the modifier is split between the drivers.  So you either pay for the more expensive driver or the average or the two drivers.  Meaning that you can add a lower risk driver and not increase the rates as long as you have more cars then drivers.  I have also seen rates go up.  But every time the rate went up it was either a higher risk driver or there were not more drivers then cars on the policy.  There may be insurance companies out there that do not follow this general rule I can only explain how it generally works.
hm7bhx6,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,1,> terms and conditions of the credit card will give you the answer on liability  This statement implies there is a credit card out there where the AU is liable for charges.

Hopefully something on this thread will help you get some answers at the very least.
hm7sw7v,TodaysMenace,11/26/2021,1,You very well may wake up tomorrow suffering from whiplash. Definitely contact their insurance!
hm8k4xt,OnlyPostSoUsersXray,11/26/2021,1,Thats insane. Personal contact outside of the financial institution is a huge no no. They will likely be fired rightfully so.  Quick story time:  I was fooling around with a girl she was married but claimed they were separated and just living together as roommates (I was young and naive forgive me). Well eventually the husband found out drama all that. The next day I learned that he was a financial advisor at the bank where I had all my business accounts at. I was worried he would mess with my accounts.  Out of an abundance of caution I contacted my local branch manager she was very understanding and said their had been no inquires into my account by him or anyone else but she would make a note and check periodically.  Got a call a few days later from her saying that the case had been forwarded to their internal (fraud?) department or whoever handles internal affairs like that. Turns out dude had looked into my accounts (but didnt move or take money).  Either way he was immediately fired and probably blacklisted in some way from working in the industry cause last I heard he was working as a bartender.
hm7qktb,iAmTheMadIrishMan,11/26/2021,1,Now isn‚Äôt a good time to buy IMO. You are pretty spot on with your price range. Which is is inflated above the 6% inflation rates we‚Äôve seen across the board. If you do new is the way to go. If you have to buy that price is about the same for a brand new Camry over here in California.

hm8adjg,djfolo,11/26/2021,1,Someone else kinda already said it. Keep a maintenance fund and emergency fund specifically for your home. Whether its old or new you have no idea what kind of stuff can happen that youll be on the hook for... regardless of whether you have a home warranty or not. Ive had home warranty companies come up with loop holes or excuses why things wouldnt be covered insurance companies have clauses for all kinds of stuff etc...   Actually do routine maintenance clean your gutters make sure no water pools anywhere near your home when it rains. Put hair traps in all drains or atleast baths or showers. Change your central air filters routinely. Make sure you have a humidity sensor somewhere in your home most newer thermostats have them. Too much humidity can be a sign of a hidden leak think about checking for mold. Theres so much man. But its worth it to do these things and keep track it can save you 10s of thousands of dollars in the long run.   Insurance doesnt cover things that break or fail due to lack of maintenance. For example if your foundation cracks because you had too much water pooling around a wall it likely wont be covered. You should have seen that and installed a French drain or made sure your gutters were properly installed. It sounds like basic stuff but man so many people dont do the little stuff and it causes very real an expensive problems.
hm761u2,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,1,Pay a family law lawyer for an hour or two of their time to explain to you all of the ramifications and if this can be written in (and enforced if need be) into the property settlement of your divorce. Plus ask the underwriter if having a legal separation in place makes a difference?   And maybe shop around for cash out refi loans with different underwriting.
hm8chvc,RainBowSkittlz,11/26/2021,1,I think its possible he does my mom told me a story about how in the 80s there was someone using her account fraudulently turned out to be a bank employee...its probably a lot safer now but thats shady af and I would probably contact your bank and let them know what happened make sure you save the message or at least screenshot it
hm8fag0,pfinancelurker,11/26/2021,1,No one here is going to fight you on consistently buying VTI. You can add international exposure if you want but you don‚Äôt necessarily ever need to do anything other than that.
hm7wv4m,RealAfricanPrince,11/26/2021,1,Rule #1 is Always take the free money. Your salary should be reasonably sufficient to quickly build a safety net or rapidly pay down debt at the same time as maxing your 401k. The time value of money is incredibly powerful when you are youngest and worth delaying other financial goals and certainly material goods (cars shopping etc)

hm8hahd,Greenappleflavor,11/26/2021,1,If it‚Äôs internal unfortunately not. As a former teller I can say they see everything. I would move the money out report it and I would also put a freeze on my credit with the three bureau. That teller has access to EVERYTHING (ssn ph address etc).
hm8kifi,asks_mrtgg_questions,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for sharing! I think my main problem right now is lack of available cash. I would have a very reliable tenant - my good friend who Ive known >10 years and is also a 6 figure earner. However I imagine he will also want to purchase his own place sometime in the near future so I dont want to count on that long term. I was thinking I could swing it still like you said but it may get uncomfortable at times. I guess it just depends on how risk averse I want to be.

hm7123y,reddititty69,11/26/2021,1,Sounds like the current offer is a no go then. That‚Äôs fine things change.  It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre withdrawing on a whim.  Tell them about the whole LTI and what they could do to ensure you come onboard.  It puts the ball in their court.  Also figure into your calculations if the new company does t have an LTI program.  Your current company may be the better long term bet.

hm7nilg,Default87,11/26/2021,13,considering how the 24% MFJ tax brackets for 2021 dont start until about ~$173k of taxable income and you make a combined $206k before deductions and retirement savings no you are not paying $50k in federal income tax each year.  you are not doing your math correctly or you have not provided accurate data in your post.

hm825l1,bruce656,11/26/2021,1,Im a landlord on the other end up this: a lot of my tenants dont have bank accounts or even *cell phones* from time to time. They use Walmart cash cards and such. Its expensive being poor.
hm7lwxx,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,Sounds like you need to grow up and get things together. It might come off as rude but your an adult. I get being in a foreign county complicates things but if your volunteering and have limited income your taxes should be really easy. 1 hour of internet access and a free tax software program doesnt seem too much to ask.   The IRS has a tool on their website you can use to figure out what you need to do. Make sure to stay on top of things going forward. Life is hard enough dont make things harder for yourself by ignoring taxes.
hm76a1x,MathandMarketsCFA,11/26/2021,6,As a thought experiment so you understand it everyone has already pointed out it is bad advice. You could simply contribute 6% instead of the 4% you are. You could then immediately sell the extra 3% (2% + 1% match) in your 401k from contributing the 2% and even with 10% penalty youd have more cash on hand  Edit: Just so were clear dont do this. Just pointing out you have a dominant strategy compared to what your father mentioned. The best though is to contribute and not sell immediately.
hm7t4xk,NotOliverQueen,11/26/2021,1,Not in the army you are guaranteed the MOS you choose. If you dont like it dont sign the contract. However if you go to AIT (MOS training) and fail you are then subject to the needs of the army.  That being said theres not always slots available for the things you want and recruiters will always push you to sign anyway to fill quotas. Do not listen. Wait for something good.

hm8alcd,ravenwillowofbimbery,11/26/2021,1,My dad did and said something similar over 45/50 years ago.  Before I was born during the Vietnam era when folks were getting drafted my dad was a spoiled only child who was flunking out of community college.  He joined the Air Force in order to avoid being drafted.  He said it was the best thing he ever did.  The military taught him discipline and useful skills and allowed him to see the world while at a safe distance from war.  He was a life long aviation enthusiast and he became a jet engine mechanic while in the Air Force.  He was stationed several places stateside and abroad.  He loved his time in England (met life long friends) and Tripoli Libya. He bought his first car a VW Bug while stationed in Europe.  He had it shipped back home when he left.    When he was discharged he used his training to work at Pratt and Whitney (aerospace firm) while he returned to school using the GI Bill.  He earned a BS in Business Administration and worked in various HR capacities before eventually becoming the director of HR and Risk Management for two hospitals.    While my brother and I were young he joined the Army Reserves and led a group of reservists as a sergeant for about 17 years. He loved it and my brother and I sometimes tagged along with him on the weekends while he fulfilled his army reserve duties (he had a desk job).  We especially loved when he would return from summer camp with MREs.  The dried fruit and tiny chiclets were my favorites.  His time served during active duty and as a reservist allowed him to ‚Äúretire‚Äù with full military benefits.  Things only got dicy for him and our family was when his unit was out on notice during the Gulf War.  My brother and I were terrified but thankfully he was never deployed.  After he died and I was going through his papers I saw where he had to draft a will designate beneficiaries etc.  it was then that it dawned on me just how close he was to deploying.    Anyway I went down memory lane to communicate my dad‚Äôs story to OP and echo what others have said.  The military and specifically the Air Force can be a good thing if used strategically.  My dad was proud of his military service and always spoke highly of the positive impact that the US military had on his life and I was always proud of my dad both in and out of uniform.  RIP daddy a big thanks to all of you have and continue to serve and best wishes to OP.   P.S. the military had such a profound impact on my dad that the man starched his pants until the day he died. He even starched his jeans! üòä

hm7fjvu,rnelsonee,11/26/2021,1,>will 1.5 months of 401k make it much more complicated or is it just a couple extra clicks?  Its literally one click into the one of the box 13 checkboxes (Retirement plan) and hit 4 or 5 digits however much it says on the W-2 that you contributed for box 12a. 401ks are completely transparent to taxes in a way: its not more complicated as your employer already accounts for it in your wages. Like someone who makes $70k/yr but puts $10k to a 401k then $60k in box 1 so the IRS just figures you make $60k. The only reason (I think) they even ask for your contribution is to ensure its less than the annual limit.  > employer matches 100% of contributions up to 3%and 50% match up to 5%  Contribute! Why are you working for less than what they are willing to pay you!? So your compensation is $104000/yr. Oh no thanks $100000 fine....
hm6x3h9,personalfinanceta5,11/26/2021,1,Why do you recommend that over nicer furniture? Just the best value/price point?  I do need folding chairs for dining table so will def consider this.
hm7pcni,Romex80,11/26/2021,1,Actual estimate is $209000. Building costs in my area are not the cheapest currently.  However  my estimate was intended to be high as I will be doing several parts of the build myself.  I also factored in about $20000 for cushion. I have been in construction for a long time and something always comes up. If the build comes in a lot lower (still done at a good quality) then I guess I pay down a bunch of principal? Treading unknown trails here.  I have 2 trains of thought. Thought 1 - it is only 900 square feet in addition.  It cannot be that bad. Thought 2 - oh crap costs have skyrocketed again. I am hoping to fall somewhere in the middle.  Edit - the house has been in the family since 1962 and it is central to literally everything.  So we are building with the intent to stay till the eventual end as it were.
hm81nu2,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,Op I feel like Ive entered the twilight zone here with 3 of you saying the tax credit is better. For 2021 yeah. But 2022 reverts back to the fsa being better. You can save 19.35% plus state taxes on 5k with the fsa and  20% on only 3k with the tax credit.
hm7gera,neuRoeeL,11/26/2021,1,Speaking as someone with a direct family history of schizophrenia/BPD I definitely understand that it can possibly be not just a want but a need to get out and away.   Youve done well to save up what you have so far but operating at a net loss (if you were to move out to a 1300/month apartment) based on your current paycheck is just a short-term bandaid. You should also consider that tenant eligibility for many/most apartment complexes includes an income requirement of 3x the rent.  Id recommend looking for a roommate or alternative housing option to lower the estimated 1300/month living cost so that you could still feasibly live on the 1600/month paycheck let alone continue to add to your savings. The stability of your own health is a critical consideration in your decision. If you wont be sacrificing too much of your physical or mental health by adding a second job then its a feasible option. If you have extended family/friends that would let you stay with them even for a little bit thats also a worthwhile short-term option until you can figure things out.
hm7l6gq,dequeued,11/26/2021,1,Our experience is that titles like this unfortunately attract a lot of trolling and low-quality comments and things tend to go downhill from there. Most of the post would be fine with a few minor revisions. It looks like youve reposted with enough information for people to answer in this case but you can always [send us modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have a question about a removal how to get a repost approved etc.
hm88s0t,rawbumhole,11/26/2021,1,Again Google is your friend.   I Googled ‚ÄòGMAC credit report‚Äô and it looks like they are some sort of bank - possibly involved with General Motors.  Did/do you have finance on a car possibly?
hm71cxn,funeralfather,11/26/2021,1,Thank you for your time reading this! So ally is better then capital one 360 you would say?
hm7vw2w,k_lena,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôve only ever sold a car to carmax but they were very helpful and offered to help me navigate the loan payoff if I needed. I imagine they‚Äôd do the same especially if you were interested in replacing the ram with something from their lot.   You could shop around ahead of time to see if you could qualify for an auto loan through your bank or credit union.  They may even offer cash out refinance for your ram to cover the repairs needed if you want to keep it after it‚Äôs fixed.
hm766uu,metaverse-emperor,11/26/2021,18,Yeah I think I get where my dad‚Äôs coming from since I live in an expensive city and my monthly costs (rent groceries fun etc - I don‚Äôt have a car tho) are about $3K per month so only $1500 saved up with $15K left on student loans with 0% interest currently until Feb 1 = get a little extra money in the next few months in sacrifice for having more later and then push it up to 6% ASAP. Confusing situation though since rule of thumb and reception is overwhelmingly to meet the company‚Äôs half-match at 6%. My parents are well-off and I feel comfortable with them as a safety net so I don‚Äôt see the ‚Äúfree money‚Äù I‚Äôll be making from now until I change it as something of a huge difference-maker but maybe I‚Äôm thinking about this wrong. That seems to be the case based on the comments so I‚Äôll likely look to meet the half-match as soon as I can

hm6tcr4,incoming_fusillade,11/26/2021,2,Go with the coast guard or the navy. Theyre basically the same - but the navy has better jobs and the coast guard has a better quality of life.  In the navy jobs are called rates and theres a famous saying choose your rate choose your fate pick the right job and youll have no problems getting a job when you get out. Also be prepared to enlist an extra 2 years for schools that have longer schools.  Read military sub reddits for more info people will be sure to help you out.

hm8lee3,trmoore87,11/26/2021,1,I was planning on just contributing a certain amount to our trad 401k to drop us out of the 24% bracket and then putting anything else we can towards Roth 401k
hm7jl5x,Turing45,11/26/2021,6,This is the best answer. We just had a similar situation with one of the residents of a property I took over in August. I was tasked with going through all the accounts and making sure they were zeroed out meaning they didnt owe or have a credit. It was a huge task on a large property in the time of covid and the initial survey found more than a few that were shown as owing because the last managers were terrible. One lady showed owing a full months rent when her ledger showed she consistently had paid for several years.   I sent her a notice of balance due and instead of freaking out and coming in and screaming at me she asked me to let her know what month was missing. We went through her records carefully with her and she contacted her bank. It took several weeks to get it resolved but we discovered that her bank and debited her account but had never sent a months rent in August. We got it all cleared up and thanked her for her cooperation.   Another woman I sent a notice to came in cussing yelling and accusing me of stealing her money and being a Crooked ass Honky motherfucker among the nicer things she called me. She refused to even try to cooperate and instead said she was getting a lawyer and suing me the company and anyone else she could sue for taking her money. Her payment history was erratic at best but she didnt owe a full months rent just a half.   Turns out her boyfriend had never paid his part of the rent for July. She never apologized but she did get a notice of violation for her behavior.  I always tell people when you start yelling and cussing you have already lost. Keep your cool and ask the right questions.
hm6z53a,nouseforanametoday,11/26/2021,2,No heat would condemn the house.
hm7ngpw,levans1717,11/26/2021,1,If Dave Ramsay were here he would tell you that you should start with $1000 emergency fund which you already have. Then work on paying off debts that you have other than mortgage if you have one. Then work on an emergency fund for 3-6 months of living expenses. THEN go hard with 15% saving into 401k. He would say stop contributing completely and pay off debts beforehand because your debt interest will eat you alive.  Edit: Also your co-workers and cousin in HR won‚Äôt care about or know as much about your situation as your father. In my opinion your Father‚Äôs financial advisor probably has some better advice than that of a cousin in HR.
hm7ojm5,BeardedMan32,11/26/2021,1,One is pushed the other is pulled. Chase is sending a check and withdrawing funds before payment is received Verizon is giving you credit when you authorize even though it takes them a few days to pull it out. If you sent your Verizon payment through your bank‚Äôs website it would come out immediately but not be received for a few days. Not sure which is more preferable.
hm76jum,EatYourCheckers,11/26/2021,1,Is 10k within your annual limits to invest in a Roth IRA? Or maybe you mean for both you and your spouse combined?  I would suggest college fund if you want a place to save money where its actually growing and not just in a savings account I use Vangaurds Admiral Shares mutual fund you can invest through Fidelity with it even though its a Vanguard fund.

hm7tr2t,Hover4effect,11/26/2021,1,I know a bunch of other Army pilots that got full time gigs with major airlines regional carriers life flight (helicopter medevac) etc. Might take a longer commitment but they totally do street to seat where you join the Army to be a helicopter pilot. The recruiters will tell you it isnt possible but I went through warrant officer school and flight school with a few.  Captains at major airlines make 200k+.

hm6xa4z,cahphoenix,11/26/2021,2,No they (almost 100%) did not. All clearance costs are paid by government agencies with appropriated funds. I cant remember the statistics but well over 99% of all clearances are paid this way.  I will concede that my never was incorrect...as it does seem that a very small percentage are paid for in some other way. How those are paid and what they are for...I have no idea.  [https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs](https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs)  &#x200B  >**How much does it cost to get a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL)?**   >   >With very limited exceptions there is no direct charge to federal contractors for a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL). Government agencies receive appropriated funds to cover the cost of adjudicating security clearances and to pay an Investigation Service Provider like DCSA/NBIB for security clearance investigations. DCSA receives appropriated funds to pay for federal contractor clearance investigations and adjudications under the NISP. DCSA also receives appropriated funds to pay for security clearance adjudication for the military service departments and other DoD agencies.  Edit: Note this is just one source there are plenty of others stating the same.  The cost incurred by the contractor is likely the cost of managing the process on their side.
hm6y3cm,jesseserious,11/26/2021,16,I could see this being viable if his objective is to get you stable and debt free asap.  As a parent his rationale is probably that hed rather his kid be in the safe zone than having you put away a few extra dollars that you wont see for another 4 decades.  Especially if losing your job would mean you need need his financial support again.  If you already feel pretty stable and can build an emergency fund then go for the full match.  Its 100% the best long term move.
hm6tmbd,lemmecheckit,11/26/2021,2,You do realize in the army you have to kill people and people try to kill you right? I wouldnt take a job where people shoot at me for 40k a year. Death lasts forever so does PTSD

hm8glj7,Fragrant-Dust,11/26/2021,1,financing is better and essentially a money maker given that inflation is like 6% right now. the real interest rate would be negative. this means theyre essentially paying you to take the loan
hm84hbt,hopingtothrive,11/26/2021,1,Dial with your insurance company. Its unlikely the offender will be found. No one can prove they were drunk. It doesnt matter anyway. This is what your insurance is for -- to cover you under all circumstances.
hm8j63k,CyberSecurityGuy1,11/26/2021,1,Good point.
hm8npxv,SeattleSushiGirl,11/26/2021,1,As a former bank teller myself for one of the large banks I can also confirm this is a breach of privacy. Absolutely screenshot this and call the branch manager asap. This may not be the first time hes done this and it may not be his last.
hm8md3r,Stroinsk,11/26/2021,1,So if you are physically able Id seriously consider the military. If youre smart its an almost guaranteed ticket to the middle class. Most importantly the day you ship out your parents will NEVER hold any power over you again.   Plenty of people get a degree when theyre in and plenty more use the GI bill when they get out. You will save yourself the pain of of crippling student loans. VA backed mortgage makes home ownership way more accessible than the average American.   If youre lucky or can afford to wait for a spot you can even just get trained in a very valuable skillet anyway and not even need further school. Think air traffic controller nuke power or IT. All jobs you can make 6 figures by your 30s.
hm8jmgo,Annahsbananas,11/26/2021,1,No no no. Op please dont listen to this. This is not good advice  1. Do not engage with the bank teller 2. Take screenshots of his message 3. Go to the bank in Monday and speak with the branch manager. Get everything in writing
hm7k9x4,ResultNo3300,11/26/2021,1,It happened in April. There was an unauthorized transaction on 4/6 from my Citibank checking account to PayPal Add Money. Then I filed claim with Citibank right after. Citibank said it was fine and didn‚Äôt need to close the account. But there were three more unauthorized transactions after 4/6 which caused my Citibank checking account overdrawn by $3200. I filed claims again and again for three times. Citibank‚Äôs answer is these transactions were authorized as payee from my Citibank checking account through mobile APP. I told Citibank that I didn‚Äôt have APP at all. I sent my phone IP address and my computer IP address. But still Citibank denied my claims.
hm6vxpn,vynm2,11/26/2021,2,You may already understand withholding by now but its basically pre-payment of what youll owe when you file your tax return. Withholding on your regular W-2 income is an estimate based on the amount of your paychecks and the info you provided to your employer on your W-4 form and withholding on your bonus is done assuming that your bonus will fall in the 22% tax bracket (hence the 22% rate).
hm8jruh,OneTwoPunchDrunk,11/26/2021,1,Yikes. I would feel extremely uncomfortable as well. Bummer for the guy that hes desperate but he could be desperate and all you for advice on how to cultivate wealth on your next visit vs. Hey stranger found your Facebook you know since I have your full name and info from my job can I have some money? Just wow. I would be on the horn to the bank straight away.
hm8i0u6,CyberSecurityGuy1,11/26/2021,1,I think the difference is that Robinhood wanted SIPC to cover their checking and savings accounts but the SIPC had an issue because (from some random news article) Brokerage firms often offer accounts for customers to hold cash until it can be invested in securities but those accounts arent meant to be strictly for savings Harbeck said. Money sitting in such accounts but not intended to buy securities may not be covered by the SIPC which insures accounts for up to $250000 of cash in the case of a brokers failure.  With Fair they pool everyones money together and dump it in stocks and they give you up to 4%. Fair will eat any loss and not pass it on to the customer. Worst case scenario you might not get 4% one month but your principle balance will never go down.  And on the flip side if they use your money and make 10% off it it they will give you 4% and they keep the rest as profit.
hm85q8g,wanttostayhidden,11/26/2021,1,If no one is depending on your income for support you do not need life insurance. Also since you have a 401k you make too much to deduct a traditional IRA so you would want to look into a backdoor Roth IRA.
hm8gnvw,tacotruck2112,11/26/2021,1,>My 401(k) plan offers allows for in-service rollovers any age any source.  You may want to check on that.  You may be able to do this with match and other employer contributions but probably not on 401k elective deferrals (pre-tax and/or Roth)  before age 59.5.  This is a regulatory issue not a plan-specific item.

hm7o9wq,shadow1515,11/26/2021,1,I figured it was something like that. Setting it up with Verizon directly is non-negotiable because it triggers a discount on the bill. Its just annoying from a personal accounting perspective.
hm6tanl,dwiggs30,11/26/2021,1,Given where you are now financially and the path you‚Äôre about to be on this is the time to search for and choose a financial planner. They‚Äôll help you work through setting and planning goals and determine where to put your money for maximum effectiveness.
hm8i7jo,Birdy_Cephon_Altera,11/26/2021,1,Banker dude here.  Better to report to corporate because if its just reported to the manager at the branch the manager can very easily cover it up and do nothing - if the manager and the employee are in-cahoots.        Most big banks have an ethics hotline or similar type of number that can be called to report violations like this.
hm7xf0n,Flakmaster92,11/26/2021,1,Yes. Small numbers to keep the math easy‚Ä¶   If you have 1000 invested and it goes up by 10% you now have 1100. You withdraw 5% ($55) to live on you now have 1045. Next year it goes up by another 10% you now have 1155. Withdraw 5% you now have 1092.   As long as you withdraw less in a given year than you made in returns your net worth will actually scale upwards even after you retire.   Now if the market drops in a given year then you need to withdraw 5% (or less the actual recommendation is 3.5-4%) of the new lower number meaning that you will have less money to spend this year than in previous years.

hm8hlti,RubyRidgebackmomma,11/26/2021,1,I didn‚Äôt suggest fraud and neglecting/forgetting to tell them does not equate fraud. Go find someone else to argue with I‚Äôm done. You know it all anyway.
hm7jg2r,Zphr,11/26/2021,1,If your saving rate is causing you to not enjoy life now then yes its too much.  If you are saving so much that youre going to have way more money than youll ever need in retirement then yes its too much.  This one can be somewhat eliminated if you have kids or a charity that you want to leave a lot of money to.  Dying with $4M in the bank isnt wasteful provided you have something useful to direct it to and that saving that amount didnt cause you to lively unhappily.  Other than that youre good at least in terms of worrying about saving way too much.  It might be that you could cut back on saving and spend more but if youre not going to get additional enjoyment out of doing so then it doesnt really make much sense either way.  Spend pointlessly within your means for today versus saving pointlessly within your means for tomorrow.  Neither is great but neither is going to hurt you much if your current spending and future saving are already good enough.  The real problem with oversaving or overspending is that people are often poor judges of what actually makes them happy.  Take the time to really think about if you are truly happy with your current setup and future plans.  If youre not then its time to make some adjustments.
hm7882f,erotictravel,11/26/2021,1,The executor is required to notify  the bank of the death and close the account.    Deliberately keeping the account open for personal gain if by definition fraud. Not only is the executor opening themselves up to criminal charges so are any of the authorized users who use the account after they know of the death of the account holder.

hm8k0rn,TwoWrongsAreSoRight,11/26/2021,1,Yeah your points are valid.  Guess it depends on how passive OP wants to be.  The very least OP should do is move to another bank.  Hypothetical question though.  Say this guy embezzled a bunch of money from different accounts then quit.  How would the bank respond?  Guess it depends on their policies but would OP be made whole as soon as it was discovered or would they make him jump through a bunch of hoops and wait till there is a conviction before being forced to?

I want to pay back the bank but I literally cant at the moment.  This is the decision you get to make.  You can choose not to pay.  Your US based credit will be trashed.

hm8hk6z,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,Just a few little things you might want to add.  Nothing major.  I see subscriptions hobbies date fund vacation but nothing for entertainment.  Assuming streaming services are under subscriptions do you use your date fund for general entertainment?  After you buy a home your utility costs will most likely increase.  You dont currently pay for or account for waste disposal.  Consider all expenses other than loan payments will increase at a rate similar to a inflation (gas and food increased dramatically this year).  Factor in expected income changes as well.  If you current budget only has you saving 1350/m you have 20k in savings and you want 55k for closing and down payment your about 2.5 years out.    Your down payment will require PMI.  As long as interest rates are low you might as well put the smallest down you can buy as soon as possible and start building equity soonest and invest the savings.
hm789gk,JustMePatrick,11/26/2021,40,I have Chase (which the OP states) and can confirm the payment would be withdrawn when it was submitted.  I would imagine OP could contact Chase to verify the check cleared.

hm6udrn,PaulR504,11/26/2021,2,hmmmmz 2% missed out match vs interest on the student loan? Interesting question.  If the student loan is low interest I would take the tax free match but if it is one of those 7% deals then I could see his logic here.  The problem is student loans count as debt when you go to buy a house.

What state do you live in just so I can look up the Filial Responsibility Law? Also who did you contact to make arrangements to allow the state take over?
hm758mt,sparselogic,11/26/2021,2,You might want to have a quick chat about that documentation with the labor board. From a quick glance looks like statute of limitations for unpaid wages is 1 year.  ‚ÄúThe only time your employer ever has the right to withhold your paycheck is when you have given them written authorization to not hand over your paycheck on time. Thus if your employer is refusing to pay you what you have earned without having gotten your permission first you do have the right to get your money.  You can file a complaint with LARA‚Äôs Wage and Hour Division or file a lawsuit in court to recover your missing paycheck. However keep in mind that there is a 12 month statute of limitation in order to file a complaint for a withheld paycheck. This means if the complaint is not filed within 12 months (or a year) of not receiving your withheld paycheck then you have lost your right to file a complaint through LARA.‚Äù  https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/michigan-paycheck-laws.html
hm81rad,WeepingSomnabulist,11/26/2021,1,Rarely. But sometimes you dont have enough cash on hand and you have pay somebody for services rendered informally by someone without a credit card machine. Like your friend took care of your dog or a relative built your fence whatever. Also sometimes older folks still write checks and give them to you for your birthday instead of cash. And then there are refunds from when the health insurance miscalculates something and actually cuts you a check for overpayment.  If it makes you feel any better Ive had the same pad of checks from my bank for the past 10+ years.
hm8jfyo,Fortunate_Fowl,11/26/2021,1,Hes going to really need money now out a job. Unfortunately thats very much a firable offence.
hm7cvo6,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,1,Dont let fear/anxiety about nonexistent work prevent you from saving for retirement.
hm8n7ui,ElectricTaser,11/26/2021,1,Yeah I‚Äôm like that as well. It sucks. I‚Äôm always amazed at how ~~fast~~ damn near instantaneously money can go out for most purchases but bills can take days. I have figured out over the years that my banks software will purposefully play with deposits and payments/ withdrawals to try to overdraft the account. Pretty sure if some one looked into it they would get a serious shit storm of negative press.
hm6xep8,OutsideAllDay,11/26/2021,1,That‚Äôs where tone is important. You don‚Äôt want to do it. But they need to fix it. Tone and being firm but not confrontational solves this. Hospitals are usually big organizations and they should be embarrassed as hell that this is happening. They also don‚Äôt really promote or give raises arbitrarily to nurses in my experience.   Many states have rules about how quickly this has to be fixed. They may be past the timeframe to do so. Retaliation is a huge deal. Be kind and understanding but firm until you can‚Äôt be.
hm7g8tn,Brandon432,11/26/2021,1,Did the money come out of your account? If not then pay your landlord. If so have Chase put a stop payment on the check and replace the funds. Then pay your landlord.
hm7jlku,___RAT___,11/26/2021,1,Wow. This is the US Im assuming? It seems so backwards. I wonder if the scale of all the bank transfers makes things difficult to update processes?  In Australia everything is or can be digital and recently these transfers all became instant. Ive not used cash since early 2019 and have never written a cheque as they were pretty much phased out late 90s or early 2000s.
hm7g5gw,MinutePianist4350,11/26/2021,1,Not since the late 70‚Äôs or early 80‚Äôs. The social security act used to have a provision that would continue auxiliary benefits for a child beyond high school as long as the child was in full time attendance at a college or university. Congress amended the Act and ceased these payments.
hm79cap,famia,11/26/2021,1,Ill keep living in the house until I graduate. See where I will end up working. If its too far of a commute sell and rent nearer my place of work. Save the money earned selling the house into an investment vehicle and use it to buy a house once Im sure I want to plant my roots in the current area Im in.  Thats what Ill do atleast. imo there is no rush to sell unless the house is in a bad area. You dont need to juggle mortgage as well so you can start selling once you have secured the place you will be moving in to.
hm74u0g,ki4fkw,11/26/2021,1,It‚Äôs true that many degrees don‚Äôt break you straight in to a desirable job. Each path is different but again you have to put the work in.   Sometimes it takes starting in the mailroom to build commonalities in relationships to get a break even with that degree.  Nothing wrong with bartending or any other job especially as a means to support yourself while figuring things out. Where people fail is resigning themselves to it forever because jobs don‚Äôt present themselves.
hm899aq,footballer2323,11/26/2021,1,Its late but if she doesnt start now it will only get later.  It will never get better.  She should do as much as she can for as long as she can.  And she likely needs to plan to work as long as she can also.

hm7y95q,josh5now,11/26/2021,1,Dont soft inquiries not affect your credit in any way? So all youd have to be careful of is not signing up for the credit offers you suddenly get. I dont care if the credit bureaus make money from that it was a bad investment for the credit companies who paid to know that I unlocked my credit cause theyre not going to make any money off of me.
hm83xaz,WindfallForever,11/26/2021,1,What do you think is the smartest financial idea? Investing is definitely up there right?  I didnt include this in my post but a big priority of mine is to start investing in index funds. Ill be taking the money I earn from my bonuses and equity and throwing it there. Ill also be using this money to save for a down payment for a house. Not in a rush to buy because the market is bonkers right now and I dont know what I want.

hm73owb,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,I think $2k-3k is a little too much.  If you run the numbers on $175k 20 year mortgage @ 3.25% the payment is $993/month. So something like 480 interest + 600 extra will get it paid off even sooner than 20 years..

hm7szju,k_lena,11/26/2021,1,A self employed 401k might help drop your MAGI enough to qualify for Roth contributions in future. They‚Äôre dead easy to set up and are offered by the 3 firms most commonly recommended here - Fidelity Vanguard and Schwab. You can contribute as an employee as well as profit sharing as the employer up to a combined max of 58k (19.5k as employee).
hm6zq33,FindFIREsomeday,11/26/2021,1,This might not even be from your lender.   This is essentially life insurance but worse.... its more expensive and only pays off your mortgage.   Your loan is a public record.  Shady companies go through the records and will slap the name of your lender onto their advertising for this bad financial product.  Its very confusing.  Its not technically a scam..... but its awfully close.  Check the fine print to see if its actually from a different company.

hm6wr8i,fuck_you__shoresy,11/26/2021,2,To make sure you have enough for your closing costs/down payments to strengthen your overall loan profile and any large withdrawals or deposits we can‚Äôt  ID offhand or source using the statements provided (ie movement from one account to another) IRS deposits transfers to your retirement accounts paying off debts listed on your credit report. Large defined as 50% or more of your gross monthly income. After that a quick skim through other transactions to look for things like undisclosed debt you‚Äôre paying on. I promise we don‚Äôt care how often you‚Äôre going to Wendy‚Äôs or that you shop at hugedildos.com three times a month. In years I have only ever noticed one thing that was hilarious and I‚Äôve long since forgotten everything about the people it was associated with.

Thats more than just bad taste/breach of trust - thats a major violation of privacy and the do-no-pass-Go-do-not-collect-$200 type of immediate firing.        I would contact the bank (not the branch itself but call the number on the back of your card and ask to speak to someone in corporate) to let them know whats going on.

Make sure anywhere you call is charging you correctly and aware it needs to go on a lift. Some places near me offered a once-over visual inspection and I could do that myself.
hm830f8,ThomasRedstone,11/26/2021,1,As someone from the UK this is truly baffling.  Are you seriously saying that when someone in the USA talks about auto pay thats just your bank writing a cheque for you and posting it?  In the UK weve pretty damn close to dropping support for cheques.  Most people wont use one most years!  We have Detect Debit which automatically transfers money to a company you have an agreement with and it guarantees that if anything goes wrong the bank or the company will cover the costs.  Weve also got Standing Orders which send a fixed amount to another account how ever often you want it to but theyre more likely to be used between people than with companies.
hm7vmvr,Pretty_Swordfish,11/26/2021,1,This! If its 2% monthly interest then you want that! If its 2% APR (ie 2% per year) and you cant contribute more than $6k per year into either this account or the IRA then go with the IRA.

hm6sujr,haggiebaby,11/26/2021,2,Thats good to know.  Ironic that their mother and I could get dinged for just trying to be responsible with the money and make sure their college is taken care of from this tragedy (vs just spend the money on normal raising the kid stuff like groceries clothes typical daily expenses).    Two thoughts (and both could be wrong).  These are good kids/good students who really look up to their mom and anything she says is pretty much accepted.  (Because their mom is a great loving mom with a head on her shoulders... not because shes controlling).  I know kids can go sideways as they hit the teenage years but I cant imagine these kids would allege their mom is holding their money hostage and go to the SSA asking for it.    Worse case I assume we can withdraw the 529 money get dinged on any earnings and hand the balance over to the kids if they insisted on the money.  A part of me hates to forgo the benefits of a 529 plan just because the kids might (seems highly unlikely) want the money when they are 18 instead of use it for college.  And if they do want it to just spend/waste it once they are 18 that money is still there.

hm6t7fq,CQME,11/26/2021,1,>With inflation rising should we move our extra payments to a brokerage account?  What is the reasoning here?  That stocks will rise as inflation rises?  That reasoning simply doesnt hold at least for the foreseeable future.  [Stocks right now are priced for a low-to-no-inflation environment P/E of 39.](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)  This level of P/E can only be sustained by ZIRP from the Fed why?  Because a P/E of 39 means investors are happy with a 2.5% rate of return from the stock market since they can borrow at near zero and make 2.5%.  If inflation rises the Fed will discontinue ZIRP and will force the market to raise its expectations for rate of return thus lowering P/E ratios.  This equates to a sustained decline in stocks if this scenario comes about (hard to imagine it not coming about).  TLDR the market is in a massive bubble right now.  Caveat emptor.
hm8jt15,Cstarr91,11/26/2021,1,What happens to your credit score if your debts are just forgiven or written off?
hm86hw0,93195,11/26/2021,1,You‚Äôll need to have at least 20% equity.  Assuming the lender (and their appraiser) agree it‚Äôs worth $280K max loan is $280K x .8 = $224K.  Re-fi closing costs probably eat up another $4K so max cash out is somewhere in the $60K range ($220K - $160K).  Keep in mind taking cash out means taking out a bigger loan than you currently have which means your monthly mortgage payment will go up.  There is no free money.  The best mortgage lender is whoever gives you the best deal.  Contact a mortgage broker and have them shop around.
hm8lva7,Beautiful-Contract-5,11/26/2021,1,You did right! <3 thank you! We need more people like you in this world. I wish people would consider us single people the most. I may not be a single mom but I‚Äôm trying to buy a home and nobody will be splitting bills with me it‚Äôs expensive for single people buying a home in this market! Nobody seems to understand. I worked my butt off to earn the salary I do but now I‚Äôm back to being poor because I can barely comfortably afford a home for $260k which most are $300k. If I were to sell my home I would be biased and help out single parents and people especially for just a $5k difference.

hm7qatt,Crazy_names,11/26/2021,1,I would add avoid things like Artillery Air Defense and other combat arms if you can qualify. I got respect for those guys but their jobs dont translate to the civilian sector very well. The one exception is the Air Defense if you stick around longer than 4 and go the warrant officer route. They have a big networking emphasis and net security skills.   But 15Q Air Traffic Control and the 35 series (Intel) are good if you want to work in government after. If you like computers and networking go for 25 series (network communications and security) but jobs like 88M (Truck Driver) can be good if you want to drive trucks or go back to Fedex/UPS as a driver. (I hear UPS is better).  Take advantage of Tuition Assistance while you are in and you can get a good jump on your degree whole you are in for basically free. You just have to be motivated enough to sacrifice nights and weekends. But more importantly look into certifications. 15T and other aircrew also feed into aircraft maintenance certifications that are really good jobs.

Also you are allowed to withdraw the money you invested with no penalties.
hm8sx1q,Douglers,11/26/2021,11,Not in the U.S. but Id think that the bank itself would provide you free credit protection with this violation.
hm6uilj,bestem,11/26/2021,7,>any SS money not spent by the time she turned 18 had to be paid back.  One of my younger sisters was under 18 when my mom died but over 18 when social security benefits from my mothers death kicked in.  They sent her a lump-sum check when she was 19.  There would have been no reason for them to send her such a check if they were immediately going to say oh you didnt spend it before you turned 18 send it back.

hm8jq43,gitcommitfuckit,11/26/2021,1,I previously worked in retail banking and moving funds over to a different account within the same financial institution will not help you. You don‚Äôt know how desperate this person is or whether the teller has messaged other customers asking them for money as well.  The teller absolutely has access to your PII including your SSN. Right now I recommend putting a freeze on your SSN with all the credit bureaus. This should only take you 15 minutes to do but might help you have some peace of mind. Ultimately the teller should not be working in banking at all- please report this to a branch manager in person ASAP.
hm7evk9,withfries,11/26/2021,1,This is correct.  Personal example: Chase withdraws it from your account. If its not cashed in a certain amount of time it is returned to your account.  Schwab Bank does not do this - nothing is withdrawn until the check is cashed.
hm8h8ff,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôve made a (sometimes bad) habit of giving people the benefit of every doubt and this is a downfall of that. I should have handled it more quickly.   It is a major US Bank if you get my drift.
hm7e94r,JellyDenizen,11/26/2021,1,Are you sure your report says 49 percent and not 49 months or 49 payments?  If youve made 4 years of payments thats 48 payments.
hm7158s,AcceptableStranger96,11/26/2021,2,Good points OP you are never going to have lower living expenses than you do now.

hm8sv0x,Chonan_Akira,11/26/2021,1,How are you getting your other stuff to Denver? You could rent a U-Haul truck one-way and tow a car carrier. Hire some guys off Craigs list at each end to help load and unload the truck.  That would save a lot of your relocation bonus for other things like fixing up your car.
hm8ea17,Appropriate_Mention4,11/26/2021,1,Wait his financial advisor told you to Leave free money on the table? Do 6% so you get full match and free money. I started my job 18 I maxed 401k even when I didnt have a dime. I wish I start at 12! I never regret it for a second. But people who didnt do regret it. You cant barrow money to retire. You will thank yourself if you save 401k money early. Earlier the better. Do not leave matching funds on the table. Please at least 6% ASAP. Good luck
hm7bhdh,QV79Y,11/26/2021,1,Your own individual budget is more important than any rule of thumb about how much you should spend on rent. It depends on what all your other spending and savings are. Only you can figure that out.

hm835rj,coren77,11/26/2021,1,If it was an auto-send check oftentimes the amount is debited from the account when the check goes out.   So OP would have seen money come out like every month.  If Landlord never cashed it funds should have re-appeared in his account within a few months.  if funds never re-appeared what is he supposed to do?
hm7r8au,93195,11/26/2021,1,You overpaid.  You‚Äôre going to need some cash to get yourself out of this but if you have some saved up sell the truck for as much as you can get and make up the difference in cash to pay off the note.

hm8o0k0,McG0788,11/26/2021,1,Tellers would have access to a fair amount of personal info. At least when I worked as one we had all the major details youd need.  As far as transferring they could also do a transfer from any acct to any other as needed. Sure theres supposed to be signatures but those only get looked at by the teller or some other bank staff should something be amiss.
hm8htar,cballowe,11/26/2021,1,The reason the banks gave was always we assume your biggest expenses are things like rent car and utilities so we run the biggest ones first because the consequences of bouncing them is big - whether thats the right thing to do or not is a different question but thats the logic they claim.
hm6xrhc,zorinlynx,11/26/2021,1,One thing I dont get is why dont they have the ability to cut a paper check. Every business should be able to do this. Even if the money from the original ACH attempt isnt returned yet what reasonably sized business cant float a single paychecks worth of cash for a week or so?  Just cut a paper check employee is happy the law is followed and everyone can move on.
hm8gko5,Ease-Anxious,11/26/2021,1,Have you ever legally fought for what is rightfully yours? This person has a legitimate labor complaint and Ive been in the Army where playing nice didnt get you anywhere Ive ran a business where letting people not pay gets your power turned off and Ive worked for fortune 500 companies who had me a check cut within 3 days of a minuscule pay issue.   The last thing Id ever suggest to someone is that they need to debase themselves by begging for what theyre legally entitled to.

hm722l6,YMarkY2,11/26/2021,1,I have a concerning question that you may or may not have thought about. You have a bachelor degree and between both you and your wife you bring home about $4k / month. That seems awful low for someone with a bachelor degree.   Before taking on the time/money of pursuing a Masters degree have you thought about what the financial benefit will be? Your bachelor degree isnt providing you with a very high salary especially in a high COL area. Are you certain a Masters will be worth it financially? What is a decent federal job? Lot of things to consider before making this commitment.
hm8htlo,QuietFridays,11/26/2021,1,I assumed they phrased that incorrectly and really meant including those things.  Like they meant after paying rent groceries etc.
hm7gb7q,Handlesmcgee,11/26/2021,1,20k for a 2011 ram with 100k+ ouch I really feel for you on that one my first car was a 2005 bmw m5 for 22k had like 90k on it and quickly learned about bmw repair costs. I ended up selling it for 5k pretty much to a guy needing parts for his.  learned my lesson and got a Honda Civic the next time and never had another problem till it got totaled 6 years later. I my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt put a dime into that truck either sell it now and take the 10k hit or drive it till it‚Äôs on rims and get 800$ in scrap at the junkyard. Best of luck to you man next time spring for the Tacoma lol
hm83ky1,Specific-Rich5196,11/26/2021,1,Sounds like you are between 20 and 25% gross in retirement accounts which is great. Some say thats the minimum to retire comfortably. You are doing great keep it up.

If your recruiter says a specific job isn‚Äôt available then tell your recruiter that you‚Äôll wait until it is. Don‚Äôt sign any thing until you have things in writing.  edit: get familiar with the military benefits and the system overall. You can make it work in your favor if you stick to a plan.
hm7hx7o,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,A cash out refinance is always as option as long as you have net equity in the home.  You dont have to currently have a loan to refinance.
hm7pkgr,oceanleap,11/26/2021,1,This. Aggressively saving when you are young is a great idea if you can do it relatively painlessly. Your expenses will likely go up later in your life (buy a House have kids) and investing early gives you the magic of compound growth. Also you dont know where the ups and downs of life will land you. Investing now gives you the flexibility to reduce contributions later if you need to.
hm73mgh,LightAzimuth,11/26/2021,171,No. If the check wasnt cashed the money would have never left the account. So there is no money to return. Easily verified either way.

hm6v98m,OxideOrange,11/26/2021,2,Since the pandemic many people are looking outside their normal nine to five to keep afloat. Given your current status it might be good to look into a new adventure and expand your skill sets. Working remotely seems to offer more flexibility. I would suggest looking into side hustles like medical billing for instance or teaching online courses within your field if applicable could also benefit. Maybe see if your employer needs administrative work that needs help with. Many possibilities. It seems like your situation isn‚Äôt permanent as you just need recovery time.  Look into an Odd Job App (there are many out there) that may help you stay a float a bit longer and even find new interest and skills you have.

Typically only the last reported number from each account matters so you can generally manipulate it as desired in 5 weeks or less before an application.

Depending on your life situation the idea works for some.
hm8lpwc,Onlytheonethatlived,11/26/2021,1,I would get my money out of that bank asap. Report this immediately this is beyond disturbing. Has to be illegal to but Im not a lawyer so very well might be wrong.

hm82v07,dmccrostie,11/26/2021,1,Think of insurance as three coverages: Liability - pays the other guy  Comprehensive - pays you when the vehicle isn‚Äôt moving  Collision - pays when the vehicle is moving  If you only had liability which most states require as minimum you‚Äôre kinda screwed. If you have collisions YOUR Company will fix your car up to the maximum coverage you have. Once they find the other guy your company will go after his company through a process called ‚Äúsubrogation‚Äù. If they don‚Äôt find the other guy typically they will still fix your car but your rates will most likely go up.   If you do have Collision along with Liability defiantly contact your agent to file a claim. Good luck.

hm8irkm,myze551ml,11/26/2021,1,> Both properties are in decent shape but could use some renovation in my opinion..... I am looking to make the best of this situation because both of my parents are in their late 50s working full time. I would say we are lower middle class  Not all renovation adds value and many of them cost more than the value they add.  The most important things when it comes to property are location location location from the few details you gave sounds like these are in good locations.  If your parents are lower middle class but have managed to own 2 properties - sounds like they are quite good at managing their money and investment to build it up.   Rather than asking random internet strangers for suggestions you may want to talk to them (along the lines of wanting to learn from them how you can build up your own real estate portfolio in future).

hm8gmef,sd0t,11/26/2021,1,The bank teller has access to all your information and accounts but probably does not have the ability to move any funds.

hm8pmm4,snail_juice_plz,11/26/2021,2,One of my children receive survivor benefits. I am **not a lawyer or tax specialist** however I opted to have the funds directly deposited into my checking where my paychecks also go rather than create a new account for child. I then transfer some funds into an investment account intended to gift to my child just as I also transfer money to the bills account my student loans etc.  From a technical standpoint the dollars here and there are fungible when it comes to what went into bills vs this investment account. However SSA does send you a reporting form where you must report what the money was spent on. I believe they have cut the frequency back for survivors benefits but it used to be every year. I report our child‚Äôs expenses such as school uniforms extracurriculars etc. My child‚Äôs benefit is about half of one of yours so this is easy enough to account for. With a larger amount that may be a bit of a challenge. The form also asks for any leftovers and if they went to *savings* it must be a regular savings account in child‚Äôs name. Be prepared in case your wife gets one of these forms which is likely.
hm6sqln,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,Some Credit One cards do not have a grace period. If you already have several cards consider not using it (if theres no annual or monthly fee) or just closing it.  It could also be that you lost the grace period at some point for carrying a balance and never regained it by letting the account sit with no activity and/or with $0 statement balance for a month.

hm8dkff,ShoopdaYoop,11/26/2021,1,Buying a set of winter tires & wheels makes the most sense.  AWD will be slightly better than FWD (when starting from a stop). Braking will be identical as the drivetrain does not enhance braking.  AWD will still be inferior to FWD with snow tires.  Not to mention its not the lack of going that causes crashes. Its the lack of stopping.  Youre going to go into a lot of debt just to obtain a sense of false confidence on slippery roads. Buy the wheels & tires instead.

hm898x6,NenetheNinja,11/26/2021,1,Thats what confused me to at first but I think this is like a cashiers check which would take the money out right away. Thats why they cant see if landlord actually cashed it after. Pretty sure you cant void a cashiers check you dont have either especially after a year.   What I would do is contact her banks fraud department figure out what bank landlord uses and have them contact that bank to see if the check was ever deposited. Best case landlord forgot. Worst case check was intercepted and cashed. Theyre supposed to check the IDs for checks but there are shady places (like those quick loan places) that wont. If thats the case the fraud department might be able to see where it was cashed and get the money returned that way. A Chase teller/customer service person wont be able to do that.
hm8ml4x,Cheesewheel12,11/26/2021,1,I was a bank teller for a year. He has access to your accounts. Not from his home sure but when he logs into the banks software on his day of work he can look up any account at any time. That‚Äôs how it walks when you walk up to withdraw as a customer - the teller looks up your name and birthday and _all_ your info comes up in one neat little window - birthday social account values address age. Of course the system logs when exactly they look whom up so the tellers can‚Äôt just pretend you came one day when you didn‚Äôt really - they have four cameras trained on a till at any time (my bank did). So you‚Äôre okay but if the person emailing you is really your teller call your bank and report a breach of trust and confidence. What he did was not okay. They‚Äôd have fired me and sued me if I did that teller did.

hm75vgq,exconsultingguy,11/26/2021,1,Think of it this way in retirement you‚Äôll withdraw enough for what you spend. Odds are you won‚Äôt have a mortgage and you won‚Äôt be saving because well you already saved for retirement. So unless you think tax policy is going to greatly increase tax rates and you‚Äôre also expecting to have higher **expenses** sans savings then yes 100% roth makes sense.   Otherwise you got half baked advice from a potential used car salesman. Remember financial advisors unless a fiduciary can tell you whatever they want. Right or wrong.
hm8kmea,Immediate-Joke8605,11/26/2021,1,Ok def. Start from 401k.. and I have no idea what roth IRA is which everyone talks about here lol let me look it up thanks..!
hm78rvl,mghobbs22,11/26/2021,3,Or start a college savings account for the kid or a future fun fund for family stuff and add more to it as you make more money
hm8n3fi,Flakmaster92,11/26/2021,1,With a three million dollar investment into VTI he‚Äôs making $60k in -dividends- (~2%) regardless of what the actual stock prices do.   With a three million dollar investment he can safely pull out a total of 105000 - 120000 (3.5% - 4%) per year and still likely end the year with more money than he started with.  A 3.5% withdrawal rate is usually considered to be ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù in that over a long term barring a total economic collapse you can stay retired indefinitely and still be fine.   As far as you starting out investing‚Ä¶ max out your 401k max out your IRA max out your HSA if you have one save as aggressively as you reasonably can even if it‚Äôs just throwing $50 into your investment account each month.   The above is assuming you‚Äôre debt free or only have a mortgage. If you‚Äôve got debt then go over to /r/PersonalFinance ‚Äôs wiki and read the Prime Directive flow chart.
hm8czd3,93195,11/26/2021,1,Technically yes you should add her.  Yes your rates will likely go up if you do.  That said others occasionally driving your car with your permission are covered by your insurance so as long as no one looks too close it‚Äôs unlikely to be an issue.  But the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answer is that she should be on the policy.  Regarding comprehensive coverage that covers damages not caused by collision (tree falls on it thieves break into it etc).  You have to have collision coverage to get it but it usually doesn‚Äôt add a ton of cost in addition to collision.  The collision coverage (beyond just liability) is what‚Äôs expensive but without it none of your damages are covered.

hm8oq2u,DrVladimir,11/26/2021,14,Banks have an extraordinarily strict policy around confidentiality of customer information. What this teller did was an extreme breach of that policy which potentially places the bank in jeopardy of a lawsuit or regulatory trouble if you were to press this super hard. This should definitely be reported

Yes.  You said 2% per MONTH... thats amazing.  > Is my logic sound?  Sure.  Thats what the PF Wiki Prime Directive Flow Chart endorses.  > Is this what you would recommend?   I would take 2% per month.  > Am I missing some hidden benefit of my employer option? (I have confirmed that I am not misunderstanding how the fund works!)  Well if youre not misunderstanding then youre probably mischaracterizing!  2% per month is rather unheard of!
hm8qanr,opiablame,11/26/2021,1,Based on this comment you should get a more capable vehicle.
hm8gik0,mideon2000,11/26/2021,1,Unless your insurance payments are ridiculous id keep both if you have no payments. You can always drop the insurance and leave the car in the driveway as a backup. If something happens to the other car you have a vehicle to use insread of having to purchase another one. A parked car needs no maintenance except starting the engine maybe once a week.    Put it this way you said you might get 3 to 4k for it. That is not even a year of payments on another vehicle if your primary vehicle shits the bed. Plus insurance on a newer and financed vehicle will be more.    Keep the car imo.

hm8s5il,cricketsymphony,11/26/2021,1,My employer doesnt have a 401k unfortunately. If that changes I will definitely take advantage of it.   Given my income I thought IRA/HSA would be the way to go for now.

hm8izv4,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,1,That argument wont work here because it was from a business. So in order for it to be a gift of equity the parents would have had to claim the full value at time of transfer as taxable comp from the business. Which they didnt. It was actually not tax law compliant what they did only claiming 50.00 of depreciation recapture at that time. However now op has to pay the taxes that the parents should have at that time but as capital gains instead of the depreciation recapture rate it should have been.

hm8dqh0,ThisIsAMonere,11/26/2021,1,Bruh.  Wikipedia even knows you‚Äôre 100% wrong.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gain  A capital gain is when you buy something for a low price and then sell it for a higher price.  If what you were saying is true what would you use to decide how much something is ‚Äúworth?!?‚Äù  For example: I flip vintage furniture. I get this furniture from people who think it‚Äôs ‚Äúworth‚Äù $20. I sell it to people who think it is ‚Äúworth‚Äù $600.  I make absolutely no improvements to this furniture whatsoever. I often sell the pieces the same exact day I buy them.  Who is correct about the ‚Äúworth?‚Äù Neither and it doesn‚Äôt matter to the tax people.  I made $580 on that furniture and that $580 is a ‚Äúcapital gain.‚Äù I have to pay taxes on it.   Where the hell are you getting this false info from??!?

hm8524y,Hundred_Acres,11/26/2021,1,I am not an expert on this stuff by any means so take my advice with a grain of salt - but I think that refinancing is better only if it lowers the cost of the loans overall. If the cost of the loans doesn‚Äôt reduce and the interest increases then you aren‚Äôt getting any true benefit out of a lower monthly interest unless the monthly payment is significantly lower to the point where you can over pay and not only kill the interest accrued but the loan faster.     It is hard to say without numbers but as I look at it for refinancing it can really be dependent on what you are looking to get out of it.

hm76l3o,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,Dont claim exempt because there are special rules for that. Rather adjust step 3 or 4b on W-4 such that you effectively turn off income tax withholding for the rest of the year.  For next year you can put $100k on step 4b. It basically says the first $100k on top of standard deduction is not taxable income.

It seems like Chase sends paper checks and its likely the check got lost or misplaced. Chase should have refunded the money if the check was never cashed.  Chase needs to confirm if the check was cashed or not if not the funds need to be returned to OP.
hm74z7f,UXResearch2019,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for your perspective. I‚Äôve been given advice from a financial advisor that a Roth 401k is ideal bc of not having to pay taxes when withdrawing. Do most people just pay less in retirement in taxes?

hm847wf,Adzehole,11/26/2021,1,If you have a copy of the lease and evidence of the date you were kicked out you really dont even need a lawyer if you cant afford one since its so cut and dry.  Also if youre in the US and filing fees are too much for you you can always do an in pauperus forma petition and if your financial situation isnt great theres a decent chance youll have your filing fees waived meaning the suit would only cost time (and maybe a stamp if serving your former landlord by mail)

I work in IT and in my career Ive had access to peoples emails their employee records and just about every other piece of data the companies have.  A high level of professional integrity is absolutely required when you have access to sensitive data and this person has shown none.   In addition to speaking to the bank Id also speak to the local donut consumption engineer about possibly being able to get a protective order on the grounds of being afraid this person might do something when terminated.
hm7heq1,Characterde,11/26/2021,1,Id put the money in their IRA account if they work in some capacity. Id also open up custodial accounts for them.

hm7dxm3,DeaconPat,11/26/2021,1,Most rental agreements/contracts specify the tenant is responsible for payment of rent on the agreed upon schedule as specified in the agreement. This makes it the tenants responsibility to ensure payment reaches the landlord (or agent specified in the agreement) on the date.   The tenant chose to use a third party agent to make the payment. Unless the tenant can secure evidence of delivery from the agent to the landlord the tenant is on the hook for a late payment. Showing a check was cut and mailed (now involving a fourth party in this instance) is not usually evidence of payment - unless the check was cashed.
hm7lkpg,benj_frito,11/26/2021,1,If I understand it correctly choosing the target retirement index fund route would be putting all contributions towards that same fund? Also in terms of choosing the best fund for her should I just go with whatever has the lowest expense ratio?

hm6utmv,fatFire_TA,11/26/2021,1,It sounds like your business has certain risks all of these can be handled through insurance. Specifically general liability insurance for your business. There are also other ones like D&O insurance etc. You can also create custom insurance plans etc for your specific risks - go speak to a commercial insurance broker/agent.
hm7wbbl,QuietFridays,11/26/2021,1,I hope this doesnt end up being too long winded but heres what kinds of things might be worth considering.  Also I am not any sort of financial advisor so this is just my advice.  &#x200B  You mentioned that your parents would bail you out in case of emergency.  Thats awesome that you have that support but you never know what might happen and that support might not always be available.  I think your dad is hoping to help you set up yourself in a position to be self-sufficient which involves planning for an emergency (such as job loss).  &#x200B  In regards to setting up an emergency savings common advice is to save anywhere from 3-6 months depending on what feels comfortable to you.  Lets say based on your given expenses this amount is a round $10k.  &#x200B  How long would it take you to realistically grow your savings to 10k with your current contribution?  How long instead if you contributed the 6% to your 401k?  Given those timeframes how likely is it that you could actually lose your job?  &#x200B  Different sectors likely have different risks involved.  For instance a software developer might have more job security that some in retail.  We recently saw this with the pandemic and with more variants who knows what could happen.  &#x200B  If you can contribute 6% and still continue to grow your emergency fund that is likely a great choice if you have good job security but know that it comes at a slightly higher risk if you were to need that extra money.  As others have mentioned you might be able to withdraw money from the 401k (which could incur penalties Im definitely not an expert on those details) but I think youd probably agree that you want to avoid doing that if possible.  &#x200B  On the other hand saving more now will give you a good sense of security and could lower overall stress because you know you can get through large emergencies without too much trouble.  You would be giving yourself time to find another good job rather than stressing about what you will do to get rent money while finding another job.  You will however be giving up free money and extra time for that money to grow in the market.  &#x200B  Since you are young I would opt for saving up the emergency fund as fast as possible and then increasing your contribution to the 401k.  But if the difference in saving isnt really too different (say it takes you a few extra months) I dont think youd be wrong to increase the contribution to 6%.  &#x200B  The important thing is to be realistic about what your behavior will likely be.  Make the plan and stick with that plan for a few months.  Then review whether or not youve been sticking with the plan and adjust if you need to.
hm7e2e9,arrown8606t,11/26/2021,1,You have paid 49% of the principal amount of your loan. At the beginning you pay more interest and less principal. This slowly reverses as the principal amount is reduced when you get furher into your loan. You now have 2 years left but during those 2 years your payments are lower interest and more actually going to the amount owed.
hm7vuwq,Petty-Pendergrass,11/26/2021,1,How you feel about the learning curve?

hm73g8o,boxsterguy,11/26/2021,2,I wonder if there was a bit of a game of telephone happening there?  Anyway yes you should probably consult an estate attorney (probably more relevant here than a tax attorney as estate attorneys are more versed in all the stuff around death and survivor benefits).  The number one rule for survivor benefits is that they must be used for the welfare of the surviving child.  You can do that by paying rent or buying food but if not then the money has to be saved for them (and presumably not in a college-only fund like a 529 according to others here).  Ive heard *anecdotally* that if you are not saving the money directly in the childs name (joint savings account in their name UTMA) and instead saving it separately under your name then the SSA may ask for all of that money back plus any interest it earned *and then it gives the money directly to the child*.  Its not taking away their money.  Its just making sure that you as a custodian are not stealing it from them.  That should all be entirely avoidable if the money is directly in the childs name.  For example Im saving for my kids in their own savings accounts (long term CDs when those used to make sense anyway) and custodial accounts in their names.  So all should be well as the money is theirs in their names and accessible to them when they reach the age of majority.  On a side note the SSA stopped asking for yearly updates on how youre using the money.  Now they just assume youre doing the right thing and presumably will check up on you at the end of their eligibility.  Not that the previous approach was much better as it was just a form where you stated what you did (Saved everything) without any proof required.
hm7guv2,LyricalPig,11/26/2021,1,Then you are likely tying up too much of your income in depreciating assets.  financing expensive cars and Making the payments: doesnt make you rich

hm6wmkb,TommyTuttle,11/26/2021,3,Your dad is wrong. The match is free money on income that you‚Äôre avoiding tax on. Take it. Letting that money sit around compounding its interest for the next forty years will make your retirement easier without lowering your present income by much at all.  Don‚Äôt forget having 6% pretax deduction only lowers your take home pay by maybe 4%‚Ä¶ yet your 401k will be getting 9% of your gross pretax income. Your 6% + your employer‚Äôs 3%. Plus market gains. That will set up a big account which will help you later when you need to buy a house: you can withdraw or borrow against it when needed. Take the full match my friend. You‚Äôll be glad you did.

Simply put you need to reduce the burden of rent against your total income. Together find a suitable place and talk to your landlord they typically understand
hm6scbs,ladyeclectic79,11/26/2021,1,Well first thing I‚Äôd do is take the ASVAB (or whatever the aptitude test is nowadays) and see where you rank then look over what jobs (MOS) are available to you from the different recruiters and decide what sounds like a good fit for you. In the grand scheme of things four years isn‚Äôt a lot of time but the training you get could propel your future. Plus most federal jobs (not all tho) give you a step up above the rest of the public by being a veteran.   On the downside since this IS military there‚Äôs a chance you could be deployed so you really need to think hard on that aspect. My friend tho has been in the Air Force for two years now and her unit doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôll deploy for anything other than training anytime soon so it can be a crapshoot. But if you need a swift kick in the rear in SOME direction the military is a great way to go.

I really had been looking at it as ‚Äúright vs wrong stupid vs smart who to believe vs who not to believe‚Äù and this reframes the perspective in simple terms about what investing is really about.

hm8h7h2,Headlessstew,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôm personally a fan of driving cars into the proverbial ground but being weather capable in Denver is nice won‚Äôt likely get insane snow but ice and slush are liable. Past that it would suck to haul it out to CO and have it crap out on you really soon but do you feel like it could just up and die without notice already? If so it might be more viable to go for a used and reliable AWD but if you think you can get a year or more reliably with your current car that might be the move. Moving is expensive and it almost always feels like it‚Äôs more expensive than it originally lines up to be. It would be rough if it crapped out after you dropped the 1200 plus getting new tires but depending on your new job you could maybe manage transit/commute on RTD or light rail until you sort out a new car ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø   Outside of that though if you have other expenses or needs that your signing bonus or reloc $ would be used for you may want to weigh those with the options for your vehicle cost EDIT: removed some typos
hm783xm,GarfieldDaCat,11/26/2021,1,> How much do you like where you live?  I do like it a lot and I enjoy being near family + friends but you might be right. Like you said I can always choose to move back if I want.   I just havent really traveled to any of the cheaper cities so not really sure where to start looking even.   I was thinking of spending 10-14 days this spring doing a little airbnb tour around the south.
hm75clu,bb0110,11/26/2021,3,The difference isn‚Äôt comparable to interest rate. It would be comparing 50% return + whatever it appreciates compared to the interest rate of the student loan let‚Äôs cal that 6%. It‚Äôs a no brainer when comparing to student loan payments.
hm6xngk,signedupfornightmode,11/26/2021,1,Lol sorry to have caused so much confusion. I was referring specifically to the last point for what it‚Äôs worth. I wish it were true that documenting in writing caused lazy people to prioritize your problem.

hm75622,CorrectPeanut5,11/26/2021,3,Banks and credit card companies get deceased notices from a variety of sources. Theyll know soon enough and close the account.    Not really fraud per se as its a card in your name and youd be on the hook for the charges in the event the estate doesnt pay. They will expect everyone to square up on whats owed when the account closes.
hm7ch6f,Firm_Bit,11/26/2021,1,> will 1.5 months of 401k make it much more complicated or is it just a couple extra clicks?  No for most folks itll just lower their AGI and lower their tax bill for the year. Try to get as much of this years match as you can.   Also find out if the company does a true up. If not youll need to space your contributions evenly throughout the year in 2022.

hm796h4,Dannick2,11/26/2021,1,You pay interest on student loans. You earn interest on 401(k)  You could theoretically put $500 extra towards your student loans and you will pay interest on balance -500 going forward.  Or you can put $500 in your 401(k) company match of $250 and begin earning interest on $750.   Your student loan interest rates would need to be 1.5x the 401(k) returns in order for it to make sense to put money toward student loans. And guess what this is nearly impossible. Not sure what your loan rates are mine are in the 3-6% range. Over the past century stock returns are about 10%.   Its a bit of delayed gratification and you will pay additional interest on your student loans. The money you invest will be worth several times as much as that additional interest in the long run though allowing you to have a much more comfortable retirement.

hm7jnrq,DeaconPat,11/26/2021,1,The key here is it is the renters choice to use autopay. Its not the landlords fault if the check doesnt arrive on time it is the tenants. This is why things like USPS return receipt/ delivery confirmation exist. If the tenant can *PROVE*  the landlord received the check then the tenant wouldnt be responsible for late fees.  In this case there is no proof of delivery so no payment was actually made and the tenant could be liable for late fees and penalties.   IANAL

hm8h8q8,93195,11/26/2021,1,There‚Äôs always a catch. Yes SIPC insurance protects you from them going out of business.  It‚Äôs not FDIC insurance though and does not protect you from investment loss.  They are calling these ‚Äúwealth building accounts‚Äù not savings accounts.  It‚Äôs NOT an HYSA.  Their website makes this quite clear:  ‚ÄúNot FDIC Insured. Although Fair will not transfer losses on the pooled investment account to customer accounts these accounts are NOT FDIC INSURED and are subject to possible loss.‚Äù  To get the 4% you also have to be a member ($7/mo) and have a minimum $25K balance.  They are also quite clear the rate is variable not guaranteed and subject to change at any time.  Is this a sweet deal?  Possibly.  But it‚Äôs not without some risk and there are some conditions.  It ain‚Äôt a slam dunk.

hm778fh,DeaconPat,11/26/2021,6,Last January my landlord contacted me and said he hadnt received my rent check when he normally has it via autopay on the last day of the preceding month. I checked with my credit union and saw when it was mailed but it had not been cashed (credit union confirmed the status of the check as not being cashed). I offered to drop off a new check right then but my landlord elected to wait a couple of more days. The check didnt arrive after a couple of more days so I hand delivered a check to him. The autopay check showed up 2 days later.  Bottom line is the US postal service is a mess and delivery times are all over the board even for local mail pieces. My guess is your payment got lost in the USPS black hole and your landlord was not proactive enough to resolve the issue that month (apparently he/she is not worrying about staying on top of such things).  My advice (worth \*exactly\* what you paid for it): write a new check to cover the lost check + any late fees/penalties due according to your lease and call it a day.
hm81ayj,dequeued,11/26/2021,1,Is that a typo?
hm899u2,anubis2018,11/26/2021,1,I return checks like that at my work. Youd be surprised what people can get away with. Mobile deposits have made fraud skyrocket. Between noone actually looking at the check before presenting it to the payee bank to people mobile depositing then taking it physically to a bank and double depositing the check.(the bank with the physical check gets the credit not the one with the mobile deposit  sso that bank always gets screwed in this situation) This shit is insane.
hm7b1eq,Birdy_Cephon_Altera,11/26/2021,4,> Most banks dont even collect the SSN and addresses for AUs.  I would be curious about this because our bank is now under a regulatory Consent Order to do just that - gather rigorous KYC documentation on all of the authorized signers on our various credit card products (which apparently wasnt happening before).  Just went through a presentation with upper management in the past week where we analyzed the expected contact rates and required additional staffing that will be needed in 2022 as we field questions and concerns from our credit card clients as we roll this out across the different brands of cards we manage.

hm81pz7,alexmm1015,11/26/2021,1,Check the Landlord / Tenant act for your state and determine whether or not the landlord and/or the tenant is responsible for making sure the rent check was cleared/cashed.  99/100 it is YOUR responsibility to either make sure the rent check clears OR notify the landlords bank that a check was given to them.  - Parents are landlords in PA and NY

hm7kas2,AkaminaKishinena,11/26/2021,1,This happened to me years ago with a rent check. Chase was able to determine that the check was not cashed and put a stop payment on it. It was a hassle though because like you the money was withdrawn from my checking account. I would recommend you keep escalating the issue with customer service until they can prove to you that the check they cut and mailed to your landlord was actual cashed. Good luck I am so sorry.
hm7tvos,knort4,11/26/2021,1,There is a customer service number on the front or on the back of the card so maybe you will be able to speak with someone by telephone as soon as possible.  Hopefully they will be able to help you in resolving this but you might end up having to bear the loss.  This has happened so often that the retail stores who sell the cards have made it a policy not to issue refunds on gift cards.  Unfortunately there is a scam going around where crooks scan the numbers off of the cards while they are still on the rack in the store and they wait for unsuspecting buyers to purchase the card.  Somehow the crooks know when the card has been activated and they also know when funds have been deposited to the card and so they immediately spend the money hoping that you (the cardholder) wont find out about the purchase until its too late.
hm73h10,insquestaca,11/26/2021,0,I would tell her you are not coming in until you get the lost check and then work for an agency.  Times are different now.
hm8f0pr,claytonsprinkles,11/26/2021,1,OP you can most certainly see if the check was paid in your online bill pay history on chase.com. Now if it‚Äôs showing as paid and the endorsement on the back isn‚Äôt the landlord‚Äôs you should file a claim that the check was apparently stolen.  It‚Äôs not the most painless process but ultimately you should be able to get your money back.  Edit: the people you spoke to were they branch based or from online banking support? Branch based bankers have very little visibility with online bill pay and the general customer service line might not have been trained on the details of online bill pay. You‚Äôll want to make sure you talk to chase online banking support specifically. Their number is on chase‚Äôs ‚Äúcontact us page‚Äù.
hm7g3c8,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,I have never paid a loan fee to take out an auto loan.  0% deals are almost always subsidized by the manufacturer to there are definitely not loan fees on them.  Sometimes you have a choice of a cash rebate or promo financing but other times there is no choice just promo financing or find your own financing.
hm76czd,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,4,I concur I work for a bank and this falls under defaulting the card. If youre intentionally using an account as an AUTHORIZED user ( not joint ) then its fraud.  If youre joint on the card then its fine.

hm7j1x1,CapeMOGuy,11/26/2021,1,Likely a condition for the policy to have at least a primary beneficiary.   Heres a case where there is no beneficiary it happened to me. My fathers policy had my mother (deceased) as primary and his mother (deceased) as secondary.  Moral: check beneficiaries occasionally especially when circumstances change. Ive seen an ex wife get the insurance money over a current wife.
hm7vo7t,KJ6BWB,11/26/2021,1,My bank is different. They just send out a regular check and when the check gets deposited then my account is credited for that amount.
hm745dx,f0urtyfive,11/26/2021,187,If its an auto-bill pay service that mails a check it may not work the same way a standard check would.

hm7hz29,addicuss,11/26/2021,1,Its not necessarily given that the landlord is trying to screw him. Auto pay is very strange in these cases. The way Bank of America used to handle autopay to things like a landlord is they would cut a physical check but debit your account. The second to check went in the mail. I actually had a similar case of OP. Had rent on autopay every single month. My check would go out. My landlord would cash it. One day I randomly get a deposit into my account the same amount as my rent. I take a look and sure enough it was a 6-month-old rent check that the landlord never cashed. The landlord never bothered me about it or noticed it so I dont know if he received it and never cashed it or got lost in the mail. But as far as my bank account was concerned for 6 months I did not have that money or any trace of it. It wasnt pending or anything else was just gone as if the check was cashed.  This was years ago so it may be different now.
hm713ka,GuiltyAmoeba,11/26/2021,4,Can‚Äôt speak for others but a friend I know retired after he turned a 20K investment into about 3.5 million In 6 years. He put 3 million into S&P 500 etf (not sure what he did with the rest of the money) and withdraws 6% annually giving him about 115K after taxes to live each year which is more than enough at his age. He also has a part time job he loves that makes around 30k a year.

hm88i1v,rkaniminew,11/26/2021,1,Understand his view and position completely however in this economy with an outlook of high inflation.    Savings / Debt is worth less than investing.    He probably wants you to have a good emergency fund before saving for retirement.    However alot of people from his era listen to Dave Ramsey types.    I would say always max out your 401k match- its literally free money that compounds overtime.    The debt will be worth less in 5 years. Carrying it wont hurt you much and you can usually *outpace* the debt interest (under 5%) if youre not being frivolous and investing in some long term funds (especially if they average out 6%+ year after year.) Then take in account inflation over 3% makes those numbers gap even wider.    Exp Student Loan - (Base Payment + Additional Principle Payment) vs (Base Payment + Ad. Principle Payment 1/2) And 1/2 of that payment instead going to individual general market fund will out pace the loan interests cost.   As for a static savings account. Its important to have liquid emergency funds but every year its worth 3% less than it was the year before unless you have a decent savings account APR.
hm7y5i2,Reddevil313,11/26/2021,1,Auto pay checks will send but if not cashed within about 90 Days the funds get returned.
hm745e8,red5765,11/26/2021,0,Okay but google: **Reasonable** cost for an actively managed fund and it returns 0.5% to 0.75%.  I would never pay someone 2.5%to manage a fund and these are just index funds.  Also doesnt really answer my question

hm7nfj6,cross_mod,11/26/2021,4,Yeah I had a check stolen from my mailbox. The person that stole it just wrote their name beside the business that it was made out to pretending that the business was affiliated with her. The bank she used cashed it! I filled out a police report and ended up having to close my checking account entirely.   Possible that somewhere along the way a fraud like this happened. Although **it would show as being cashed on Chases end.**

hm87l5y,Thegreatoz123,11/26/2021,1,Sounds like you really want to have a 100% rating for the post 911 GI Bill(chapter 33) when you get out. If you happen to have some college loans they may offer you loan repayment. Do not take it unless you plan to do a second enlistment. 3 years of your first enlistment will go to earning your loan repayment meaning only a year is credited to GI bill. I learned of this detail after having it written as an option on my contract. I didnt even use the loan repayment once I found out the details but the VA still used it to deny my GI Bill rating for over a year. I was almost homeless because of that mess. Also do your own research on every promise the recruited gives you. Mine said sure you can have both loan repayment and the GI bill. Technically true but with a giant catch.
hm7g162,ricksebak,11/26/2021,1,>	I am definitely switching now.  Probably a good move. And while you‚Äôre making this change in your account settings you could increase your 403b contribution by 22% without your take home dropping at all if you wanted to since previously 22% of those dollars were being withheld for the tax man.
hm7grky,BurnAccount1974,11/26/2021,1,Yeah that‚Äôs my struggle basically. I‚Äôm in an AMAZING new job but I have to pay down some credit and give my new income time to get established to boost my score before I try to get into a different car loan.  Ideally while prices are still high I‚Äôll get word that my return-to-office date has been extended allowing us to use one car temporarily. Then I‚Äôll be able to sell my car to get out from under my post-bankruptcy loan and bank the difference (I was only upside down by 1-2k before prices went up). Hopefully by the time I get recalled prices will have stabilized AND my credit score would be WAY up allowing me to use the original overpayment as a down payment for a new loan with a different lender at a lower interest rate.
hm8i9ws,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,I am curious from others... What order  would you rather these post? You want Netflix to clear and your mortgage to overdraft?    What if the bank doesnt cover the overdraft? Do you want Netflix to bounce or your mortgage to bounce?

hm8jtfm,kutes,11/26/2021,1,This kind of thinking is why those neighbourhoods are so terrible.  Man though what a bizarre situation.

hm6w5pl,Ecstatic_Being8277,11/26/2021,3,If she is signing off on title (new title in your name only) you have no downside.  She though is on the hook for the loan.  Doubtful she would accept.

hm6zic9,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,If You claim exemption from withholding then that means you expect to owe zero taxes to Michigan. Like you dont even have to file for Michigan.   Doesnt sound like that is the case. So dont choose that exemption
hm877er,rooski616,11/26/2021,1,Most on this sub will automatically advocate for the retirement savings free money but there definitely are exceptions such as yours.  You need to make sure you can live now to take advantage of the retirement savings later. Get somewhat comfortable now then go after the employer match. Just make sure you are smart about it in the short term so you start taking advantage as soon as possible.
hm74qb1,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,> Any tips or advice on how to continue down this path and not get trooped up?  You can schedule a payment from your bank account to pay the same amount to your credit card to get the effect that money is gone faster so you dont overspend.
hm8tqq8,antifaction,11/26/2021,2,Usually having the longest history of payments being made on time is best. 5 years of paying a secured loan on your history is better than 2.5. Also your credit score doesn‚Äôt mean that you are good with your finances. That‚Äôs a huge misconception. Banks want people that are pretty good but not perfect. They want their money back and don‚Äôt mind late fees- but they don‚Äôt want someone so bad that they will default.
hm75lna,smoothbrainkoala,11/26/2021,1,Saw the title of this post and wanted to come here to briefly say: Infantry sucks. A lot. Just my opinion but try it if you wish.
hm792pu,Phoenix2683,11/26/2021,1,Incorrect.  If they lost it its standard practice to stop the check and re-issue them a new one because funds wouldnt be taken from your account. If they lose it they should deduct the stop check fee.  This case is a bit different because the OP doesnt have the money but neither does the landlord from the sounds of it. Chase is the one who failed here. They sent the check but never dealt with a stale dated check that hasnt been deposited. They should have followed up with it and like OP said refunded the money if it wasnt cashed.  You have no clue if the landlord even received the check mail delivery is atrocious right now.
hm7pgma,principalNinterest,11/26/2021,1,Last year (summer 2020) I got a 2.5% 5-year and 2.7% 7-year fixed rate loans through MSs pledged asset line (they call it an LAL--[https://advisor.morganstanley.com/the-capitol-won-group/documents/field/c/ca/capitol-won-group/Lending\_LAL\_ClientBrochure.pdf](https://advisor.morganstanley.com/the-capitol-won-group/documents/field/c/ca/capitol-won-group/Lending_LAL_ClientBrochure.pdf)).  They let me pick anything from monthly amortizing payments to annual interest only payments and the rate and term wouldnt change.  I think these rates were offered as a special at the time but nonetheless gives an idea of whats possible.  My AUM with them isnt notably different than what you have.  I previously had a mortgage on my primary residence through them and while i didnt take advantage of it they also have an offering that allows you to pledge your portfolio in lieu of downpayment/PMI.  This is a little stale from earlier this year but does have a rate sheet that should provide some context for whats possible:  https://advisor.morganstanley.com/sandra.wang/documents/field/s/sa/sandra-wang/Portfolio%20Line.pdf
hm7su69,93195,11/26/2021,1,A 25% effective tax rate is fairly normal at your combined income.  To reduce it make less or give away more.
hm6x3ko,CrimsonTide2000,11/26/2021,1,100% military will be worth it yes! Granted its not for everyone though. Find an MOS you can use in the real world once you get out. Preferably something you enjoy. Im one of the people that wish every young person would go in the military thats how much of a positive effect it has on people overall. Once again though some people arent cut out for it but if you are debating on it on your own then yes it would be great decision. One of the best decisions I ever made 30 years ago lol.
hm7ddw8,Penguinis,11/26/2021,1,> financing an education just isn‚Äôt worth it when you consider how expensive college is vs the pay of the job you aren‚Äôt guaranteed to get.  Depends on the field/degree. Getting a history degree will be a lot more difficult to pay off any loans taken out than say a degree in tech. Nothing is certain and for sure people do it either way but the odds are better if you major in a more desirable field.     > I just can‚Äôt seem to find something worth putting my time into that sets me up for a good future.  I think maybe you might be looking at this whole thing the wrong way - instead of waiting for/finding something that sets you up - why not actively work within what you already have going for you. You work at FedEx and assuming your living situation is stable at your grandmothers why not do classes that you can pay for out of pocket no loans and no 4 year commitment that you arent sure you want to make. Is that road easy? Nope its work but so is joining up and going that route.      > I just need some good solid advice on what I should do.  You should do some real hard introspection on where you want your life to end up at. Good future is vague try and map out concrete goals you want to accomplish. Then once you have those in hand - look at what the options provide as a means to achieve those goals. Pick based on that not just because at 19 you can‚Äôt seem to find something worth putting my time into that sets me up for a good future. At 19 its pretty ok to not be locked into a career path that youll work in till you retire.

hm8l1lg,NerfherdersWoman,11/26/2021,1,I would agree that some trades that are unionized may be harder to enter but dude theres so many other trades than pipefitting and I dont know about you but Id rather bust my butt to join a union than go places and shoot innocent people for G.O.D. just to pay for school. There should be another choice. I think a lot of people forget about AmeriCorps and trades are not only viable but for some people more desirable alternatives. While I support those who serve respectfully and honorably always. I do think there ought to be more options than risking your life physical and mental health to pay for school.
hm8jhes,QuitProfessional5437,11/26/2021,1,The land is. The mobile home I doubt it. But there are youtube channels of people that buy trailer parks. They own the land and the mobile homes pay them to be on their property
hm7t1vt,meliaesc,11/26/2021,1,Sure and you only get a 401k if your employer offers it and you can only contribute to an ira if your income qualifies...
hm6tfvi,54lzy,11/26/2021,1,Look at what it will rent for versus the carrying costs. What‚Äôs the net return versus what you could sell it for? The return will be higher compared to buying a new property due to the low base year and this might help you decide whether it is worth keeping.
hm7e8n5,interstat,11/26/2021,1,Its very doable depending on circumstances but not realistic for a lot of people  My wife makes more than me at 200k we have no kids and own our house outright from aggressive savings and low cost of living in our 20s.  280k out of our combined 350k is essentially savings ( pre tax idk the after tax but percentage of income is the same)  This is obviously not realistic for most but very possible in the future for a lot
hm8c2b1,PM_ME_YOUR_CALICOS,11/26/2021,1,Yeah Id pass if they make it needlessly difficult to get an inspection. If he wants to repair and sell cars this is something he should know is going to happen.  The car market is pretty trash right now but another car is out there if this one doesnt work out. Dont feel like you need this one because of supply issues or sunk time.
hm8hqgm,Boobsiclese,11/26/2021,1,You MUST report that teller IMMEDIATELY. I would do it in writing as well as verbally. Go to their website like tonight  send a screenshot of the convo in your message and tell them youll be in first thing to talk about it in person as well as wanting a response through email. Then you have a record of notifying them.  That person is FIRED. And if they arent Id go higher. They have access to everything you have on file with the bank. You and everyone else. If they did this with you theyll do it with someone else if they havent already. Watch them target someone vulnerable to their BS. Theyve got to go.   Source: Previous bank teller.
hm73fho,80andsunny,11/26/2021,3,You picked a great time to be in this situation.  Depending on condition any of the above are likely to offer you more than you owe maybe even close to what you paid for it.  You can also sell to a private individual but its a little more complicated than a cash sale.
hm707ti,darthrater78,11/26/2021,27,Did six years in the Air Force myself. I have relatives in all the branches and they all said in one voice Air Force.   I didnt continue my ASFC once I got out but the discipline and work ethic served me very well.   Words of advice stay clear of the traps! Dont get married dont get a brand new car stay away from the strip clubs (clubs in general)  and stay away from the dirtbags that drink to excess and do drugs. They WILL drag you down with them.
hm6vx44,joey_subie,11/26/2021,2,Web Development at a local technical college. I will be done end of 2022 with my associates so I really got to get a move on sorting my finances out.   My girlfriend helps with bills but since we are mortgage free I dont mind paying the bills most of the time.   We could have a roommate considering we have an extra bedroom but we definitely value our privacy so we would have to discuss that since we dont have the most space in the world 3bd 2 1/2bth.
hm89ti6,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,Lol this just shows how little you know. My father would be charged a gift tax for the value of the house. Now you‚Äôre claiming I‚Äôll be taxed capital gains for anything over the $1 I paid. The same value is being taxed twice under your logic. That‚Äôs not how it works.
hm7mwma,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,You earned it dude...Thanks for protecting us!
hm7bvm5,tuxed,11/26/2021,1,Make sure you have an emergency fund first. Since your income is unpredictable I would ensure you have at least 6 months of expenses.  Save as much as you can after expenses. Here you don‚Äôt want to work off percentages but rather absolute dollar amounts.
hm74ws8,Agirune,11/26/2021,2,Got a friend that rented a shared appartment the landlord gave no contract to not declare the money took him 3 months to fix the washing machine walked in on the flat whenever he felt like it refused to give back the fee when he left the appartment etc.   There are assholes everywhere but is wrong to assume that everyone is.
hm88sqs,Fishtale1,11/26/2021,1,Definitely will tomorrow morning! And if I cant find someone to do that on a day that works for both the seller and I to go meet youd pass?

hm7irsy,Econ0mist,11/26/2021,1,53 is definitely not too late to start but it will probably require some significant lifestyle changes for her to allocate sufficient money into retirement savings. And she probably needs to work until age 70.  > She is a single mother  Was she married for 10 or more years? Or is she widowed?
hm7ruoo,93195,11/26/2021,1,Is it worth it to get a full inspection and repair quote?  Sure.  That‚Äôs the right answer financially.  That said if it‚Äôs a 20 year old car worth a few thousand or less it still drives fine I‚Äôd personally probably just let it go.  But that‚Äôs just me being nice.
hm6vvob,zacce,11/26/2021,3,Quicken can give you cash flow forecast but you have to enter all the future income bills.
hm721qp,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,3,To clarify the outstanding debt to the original 401k loan technically can still be treated as early withdrawal when he quits. This is up to the 401k plan and former employer. The technical term is called a **loan offset**. Normally someone has 60 days to rollover an early distribution before it becomes permanent.  But for this one particular type of loan offset when someone leaves the employment with the 401k loan in good standing called **qualified plan loan offset (QPLO) Code M on Form 1099-R** he can delay including the offset balance in gross income and early withdrawal penalty *and* be able to send the repayments into his new 401k or his traditional IRA and treat these repayments as rollovers until the new Oct 2022 deadline (tax return due date plus extension). As you know rollovers are not subject to tax or penalty or contribution limits.  Make sure to file tax returns on time.
hm72edi,ResoluteClover,11/26/2021,1,Interesting. PNC never did that for us they kept the money until the check was cashed.
hm7ndkb,JeepMan831,11/26/2021,1,Seems like that should be saved as his emergency fund. Maybe put it in bonds (I bonds are all the rage here recently) if he definitely wont need it for at least a year.
hm7cf98,rdobah,11/26/2021,1,What happens if the landlord tries to redeposit the check you just printed out?  If it was cashed then no funds would be available.  Isnt there a return fee for failed checks?  If it deposits then it was his/her fault they didnt cash the check.
hm7yozx,_Toomuchawesome,11/26/2021,1,okay makes sense. in the 3 million investment example even with him pulling out ~115k each year thats like ~20 year runway...  pretty fucking insane. i gotta start strategizing
hm7pwed,Firm_Bit,11/26/2021,1,We‚Äôre kinda drowning in work rn so saving is the only place for money to go. In a few years though we think we‚Äôll probably start spending a bit of it haha. Been living pretty lean and we‚Äôd like to buy a place travel as much as possible etc.   Just scoping how we‚Äôd balance living and retirement rn though.
hm6x82f,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,>. If you‚Äôve paid over 90% of what you owed in taxes last year you avoid the penalty usually.  This is NOT correct!  To fall under the safe harbor you have to have **100%** (110% of your prior year AGI was >=$150k) of your **prior year tax liability** *withheld* from your paychecks for the year. The 90% relates to your current year tax liability-- if you have at least 90% of your current years tax liability *withheld* from your paychecks you can also fall under the safe harbor.
hm8e2sm,rawbumhole,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôd be waiting outside the bank first thing in the morning for them to open. You need to take this very seriously and report as soon as possible.
hm7jyxu,UnquestionableBadger,11/26/2021,1,Thats really between you and the legal system if it comes down to that.
hm89wbt,NenetheNinja,11/26/2021,1,Its def something with Verizon because I dont use auto-pay and they still take a few days to take the money out lol. Not even a pending charge shows up like everything else. Maybe its more like a warning so you can be sure you have money in the bank before they try to take it lol.
hm7qorn,chopsui101,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôd put it all into a S&P fund‚Ä¶..at this late stage the TD funds will be mostly bonds‚Ä¶.which don‚Äôt pay much.  The difference won‚Äôt be enough to make sense a bond is paying like 3% and it tapers off as time goes by.  Even if the market does well she ends up with less than 110k.  Either she is going to have to heavily par back her life style keep working or her kids will have to subsidize/support her.  Dump it into the S&P she might get 7% and end up with 140k not a lot more but still better than what she would have.        IMO its so late in the game for her she needs to take some risk in order for it to make any financial difference.
hm89691,wanttostayhidden,11/26/2021,1,You make too much to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. You can always contribute to a traditional IRA but you make too much to deduct it on your taxes.  You would need to look into doing a backdoor Roth to contribute to a Roth IRA where to contribute to a traditional IRA and then convert that money to a Roth IRA.
hm8fccg,Donkeywad,11/26/2021,1,I have Chase and have been in this situation. Its 100% possible to see if the check has been cashed just by clicking it in your transactions of the portal no rep help needed. Youll be presented with images of the front and back.
hm8nymc,Ashkir,11/26/2021,1,Yes. I agree. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable because they may be there and it‚Äôs a chain bank go to another location.
hm7tasf,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,i am thankful to not have to go through the process but from what i remember you are correct. It is just my preference to not have to go through all that paperwork and have the money available when needed.
hm7e0zi,Worldatmyfingertips,11/26/2021,1,Well you can put complete sentences together and use grammar fairly well. With average intelligence to above average intelligence I would suggest going Air Force. Study hard for the ASVAB get at least a 75 or above (0-99 scale). With a little patience you‚Äôll be able to get ANY job you want. Just look up AFSC‚Äôs (Air Force equivalent of MOS) to see what seems to be something that would interest you.  Although here‚Äôs a completely different way of looking at it. Try to imagine that whatever you do you may end up liking it and stay for the full 20 years and retire. Try to think of what job you‚Äôd like to do BUT also one that translates to the civilian world. The following are career paths that would benefit you the most while also being the least taxing on your physical body:  Intelligence (Analyst)  Medical  Finance  Cybersecurity  These are broad categories and there are many jobs under them. But I would suggest these because of how they‚Äôll translate in the private sector and without sacrificing (possibly) your body.
hm72sn7,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,OK Ill have to do a six-month contract (<--common in Ireland) at a fairly entry-level position of maybe only $40K (‚Ç¨35K) while I switch onto the new career track but thereafter I should be able to secure a salary in line with my related experience so around $60K (‚Ç¨50K).   Ill work in Ireland while I save and live with my Mom so Im guessing I can save a lot pretty quickly.  Then I can reasonably expect to earn up to $80K (‚Ç¨75K) in 3-5 years.   My job as an office manager maxed out at $50K with no opportunity to grow further and I felt like I was always broke so the gamble seemed worth wrecking my credit.
hm88edu,hjthrone,11/26/2021,1,I appreciate the information. Very helpful.
hm7cb6d,spanctimony,11/26/2021,1,Of course Dad isn‚Äôt going to like it when junior comes asking for a hand out because he went broke.  But I also don‚Äôt think Dad is going to ask for paystubs to make sure he didn‚Äôt max his 401k in that event.  I think Dad‚Äôs advice is wrong.
hm7qjkw,wickedkittylitter,11/26/2021,1,Or the W4s arent filled out correctly.  That would mean the OP is getting a significant refund.
hm726ml,Searchlights,11/26/2021,1,Call the department of labor on your State.  There are people whose job is to wait for those phone calls and come down like the wrath of God on employers.    Ive seen it happen.  I had a guy fuck up his payroll and direct deposit forms six ways from Sunday and the hammer came down on us when he complained his DD didnt show up on pay day.    We had to stop everything write a check and drive it to his house.  It was totally his fault but the point of telling you the story is the DoL will have your back 100%
hm7r6q4,majestrate,11/26/2021,1,Normally you can contribute 8-12% without it impacting your take home. You should use a 401k calculator to see how much you can contribute before your paycheck is affected
hm8jfev,diatho,11/26/2021,1,Yeah. Then your dad is right. While its free money you need to find a way to build your efund/general savings. If you go for 6% then cut other expenses.
hm7rcb2,madmoneymcgee,11/26/2021,1,Take the match. If the $60 dollars (thereabout) to get you to the full six percent is a serious crimp in your monthly cash flow then you have issues beyond anything your dad brings up.
hm7lzna,NotTRYINGtobeLame,11/26/2021,1,If the autopay is setup through Verizon instead of the bank as in OPs case Verizon does initiate the debit on the day they send the thank you but because of how ACH works it doesnt post on your bank account for a few days. Im not an expert though so if Im wrong on that well its Reddit so Im sure someone will correct me quickly enough lol
hm8h8vy,QuietFridays,11/26/2021,1,A few things Im pretty sure dividends dont get taxed at a different rate since they just increase your taxable income.  &#x200B  It looks like you can get up to 4% assuming their subsidiary Fair Invest actually makes profits from their investments.  If they dont you dont get any interest.  &#x200B  And as others point out a membership fee but at least for the next month theres a one time fee option.  Hopefully they make reasonable investments and you can actually make close to the advertised maximum rates.  I think Im skeptical.
hm88ioc,maderickbep,11/26/2021,1,If you move in with someone before youre married you find a place that you can afford on your own if it doesnt work out between the two of you.
hm8at0y,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôll find another brokerage then. Would be nice to automate it but dropping 3k isn‚Äôt something I can convince myself to do so I‚Äôll just do a clean 100 bucks a week for now.
hm7tqyn,Rear_ended_old_car,11/26/2021,1,Im confused. Did they offer you a $600 check to get it repaired? Did you pay out of pocket to get it repaired?  I like my car in the sense that I use it to get from point A to B.  I was also planning on giving it to one of my family members next year. Im just concerned about possible structural damage to the car that Im not seeing.
hm758rt,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,1,How many credit cards do you have just the 3? Good look and see about balance transfer promos with your card companies to maybe get a 0%. Loans is another option but I wouldnt cut cards either you can still use them just dont over spend.treat your cc as a debit card if you have to. Charge something? Pay it immediately. or put the money into a separate bank account and separate from other transactions you have to ensure it balances out.
hm80ixb,Floomby,11/26/2021,1,https://old.reddit.com/r/ChildofHoarder/
hm8flsr,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,Yes but in this case the car was sold for less then market value by their parents.  That would be considered a gift of equity.  So capital gains tax would be based on the value of the car when OP got it minus the sales price.  Most likely they did not make a profit as far as the IRS is concerned since most cars lose value over time.
hm7ft48,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,I am on the same boat as you single no dependencies etc... What I have been doing is first setup a relatively good emergency fund one that can support me for a year without a job. Once you build that cushion invest in your retirement. Since you are self-employed I would think of opening a Roth IRA (6k limit a year) and an additional traditional IRA. I also invest directly into the stock market (with what I call play money) and look for opportunities as well to buy real-estate. Should you pay your mortgage? It all depends on the ROI. If the ROI of an investment is higher than the interest you are paying on your house well invest!
hm7g7pi,rolopumps,11/26/2021,1,It‚Äôs. It your job to prop her up.  It‚Äôs your job to treat her with respect and kindness but your not her piggy bank.

hm7tsya,lunlope,11/26/2021,1,Yeah thats fine too.  Whole point is if people are doing more now they are probably in better for their future.  Personally i prefer 401k-ira-hsa in this order in my income but yours also works too.
hm8kioj,iced_out_pickle,11/26/2021,1,We do use our date fund for general entertainment eating out shows etc. We pay our membership fee to a local rock climbing gym that we both go to out of that as well. I think were both really satisfied with our level of fun and entertainment right now haha.  I took our current utility costs vs. our apartment sqft and multiplied them out based on what I think our house sqft will likely be which isnt the best estimate but is decent enough I suppose.   Note: we have the $55k saved now so unless we wanted to buy bigger wed be good to go for this amount. The $20k emergency fund is separate and something were not going to touch in order to buy the house.
hm838m9,ForeverALone_Ranger,11/26/2021,1,A lot of antiquated businesses (like landlords) dont accept direct payment here in the states. Some will only take checks. In addition American banks havent bothered making direct payments an option because they havent been forced to.
hm6y3gl,DekuChan95,11/26/2021,3,I wouldnt include your bonus in your budget since you might not get it or all or it every year. Once you do get it then you can use it for savings etc. Get a reliable car that will last you years..do not get an expensive car just bc its nice and fancy. Theyre higher maintenance and need premium gas. My bf has a 8 year Audi from his mom and he just drops thousands of dollars on maintenance/repairs and a full tank is $55-60.
hm8htd7,SlowJamm,11/26/2021,1,I see your points but if youre worried about retaliation then making it an issue is the last thing you do. It has by far the highest chance of coming back to bite ya. I get this is reddit so the most logical response is always right.   Ive grown up in rough neighborhoods and theres a reason why people never ever call the police there. Thats how you get retaliated. If OP just forgets about it then its never his problem again. Switch banks and move on with his life with zero fear of anything.   This is just my opinion and what Id do. Im not saying your view is wrong.
hm7dqxi,lstac936,11/26/2021,1,It was 13 percent. However I joined the military a year ago so they had to drop the rate to 6 percent
hm8kg38,CyberSecurityGuy1,11/26/2021,1,Question for you all   In the terms and conditions it states:   Although¬†Fair¬†will not transfer losses on the pooled investment account to customer accounts these accounts are NOT FDIC INSURED and are subject to possible loss.  If Fair will not transfer losses to customer accounts and your money is protected by SIPC if they were to go out of business other than the 4% interest you earn month to month what other loss could you be open to?

hm7w8s3,Anonymoose2021,11/26/2021,1,Normally bonuses are withheld at a 22% rate.   So Bonus 1 would be $66.8k bonus 2 is $55k and bonus 3 is $9k for a total of bonuses of little over $130k.    So are your incomes of $56k and $150k including or excluding bonuses?    The numbers dont add up.  Either your total income is more than you said or you are grossly over withholding.
hm6x0vv,football35249,11/26/2021,1,Its unlikely this is a good idea for you. In general single family homes make bad investment properties being a landlord isnt something you just casually do its a job that takes work and effort and theres a lot that can go wrong that you need to be financially prepared for and a house in a good neighborhood does nothing for you if you dont plan to live in that neighborhood again. Cash out refi isnt inherently bad its a tool to access cash with a bit of increased risk because its secured by real property. But you dont seem to have done any leg work here to give us actual numbers to work with so its hard to say any of this for sure.
hm8czol,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,No it‚Äôs not. If you buy a car and increase the value of the car then it would be capital gains taxed. This dude did nothing to increase the value. He just bought it for cheaper then it was worth.

hm8f6vn,TrumpsBoneSpur,11/26/2021,1,It depends on the insurance company.  They may provide both options.  It usually takes less than a half hour for inspection and estimate sheet
hm8t132,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,There are some bookkeeping magic behind the scene such as shuffling between risk-taking investments and money market. The reason why qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate is because the same money has already been taxed at the corporation level. The brokerage needs to be able to identify which companies the dividends came from.  > If Fair will not transfer losses to customer accounts   Until they run out of money.  > and your money is protected by SIPC  Assuming it is currently in money form when bad things happen.  If it is in shares SIPC will give you exactly the same shares back the same shares that lost value.
hm74zuc,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,2,Call customer service to process a withdrawal. Why are you trying to convert it to Roth IRA? Dont you need the money now?  If you have money in Roth IRA why dont you use it first? There is no tax or penalty withdrawing Roth IRA contributions.

hm8dz5b,asks_mrtgg_questions,11/26/2021,1,Yeah you are right. I think continuously watching the prices skyrocket around me the past 2 years has driven me a little crazy and I needed to be talked off the edge of making an ill-advised purchase. I will plan on saving up for now and hope that prices level out in the meantime otherwise I will just have to look elsewhere for purchasing. Thanks for the advice!
hm871c5,eggbirdegg,11/26/2021,1,i have a costco membership  maybe similar
hm81zn0,nancylyn,11/26/2021,1,Just call your insurance agent. I have no idea if they will cover the property but you have to tell them you moved anyway and give them the new info so you can do it all at once. My renters insurance covers my stuff no matter where it is (when my bike was stolen out of my friend‚Äôs car they covered it) so if it Is damage or loss of your belongings then it may not matter that your address changed. However if you damaged the property‚Ä¶.I don‚Äôt know.

hm78s5j,GarfieldDaCat,11/26/2021,1,Yeah I do really enjoy being able to bank the majority of my income just tough living at home as a single guy at 25. I also am relatively frugal (cook most of my own food drive an 8 year old toyota etc.) so I am truly blessed to be able to save as much as I am.   I have considered option B but I am just very hesitant to live with random people again as I had a terrible experience before.
hm7qhnd,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,Because your two arent against earning your own keep. Some folks feel entitled to others hard work!
hm7ths6,ronald_mcdonald_4prz,11/26/2021,1,So you‚Äôre suggestion is to lose to house and lose the earnest money? Would be much better to buy the house and then take a mortgage out on it
hm753b9,buildyourown,11/26/2021,1,How much does your dad have for retirement?  Save for retirement while young.   This sub tends to over stress emergency fund. If you have other ways of dealing with an emergency you dont need to have that cash sitting around.  I lived for years including owning an old house with never more than a months cash on hand.  Im just fine and never got too worked up floating an emergency on a a credit card for a month.

hm6x3x3,Gavilan_y_Paloma,11/26/2021,2,So in this case I most likely will not keep this vehicle after repairs. That being said would it be more profitable to simply have them give me a check for the value of the vehicle?
hm7z1lt,wrldruler21,11/26/2021,1,Yes. You can open as many bank accounts as you wish. Just ignore the Wells account
hm7c55y,DudeHeadAwesome,11/26/2021,1,I just sold my suv with a loan. Carmax offered me the most when shopping around.   They payed off the loan and gave me a check for the amount over loan amount.
hm8nfnt,jongleurse,11/26/2021,1,If you make a trust you will create a pour over will at the same time which basically says that all my assets go to the trust. The will becomes public record and those assets go through the probate process. Anything that is owned by the trust prior to your passing skips probate.
hm8bh79,pridkett,11/26/2021,1,Thats not the way that every bank does it. I had Chase set up this way for a long time - but stopped a few years ago when I stopped having a rental place. Chase debited the account as soon as the check was mailed because the check withdrew from a different account. In that sense the person getting the check was receiving something they could nearly guarantee was good.  My current bank does the same thing. Debits my account as soon as the check is cut.
hm7bldj,Penguinis,11/26/2021,1,>Yeah... you ARE guaranteed that pay  No no you are not. I know many people with **4 year** degrees in IT that dont/did not make that starting out. Its fantastic that you did it and the market in which you are situated seems to support that (based on your claims) but it is certainly not the absolute rule everywhere. If the market gets saturated they pay less. Just how the world works.  Your advice has some merit in it but Id caution making claims like you are  guaranteed some pay rate. Its in the same vein as take a coding boot camp youll land a job no issues which is far from the reality.
hm72mas,BEtheAT,11/26/2021,2,USAA doesnt take it out immediately if a physical check is mailed. Physical checks follow normal check rules. Electronic bill pay removes it immediately.
hm7plvm,Firm_Bit,11/26/2021,1,Sweet thanks for the heads up
hm8a3qw,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/26/2021,1,I think with VTI if I buy one share I should be fine to spend whatever on it after or maybe I‚Äôm mixing it up with VTSAX.   Thank you so much for helping me out
hm84ls1,ThighOfTheTiger,11/26/2021,1,If you want to consider take home numbers only subtract taxes and insurance premiums. The other stuff is your money. Thats why people usually talk about gross.
hm7cncm,SaratogaChase,11/26/2021,1,He never said he saved that making 80k a year. Only that‚Äôs what he makes now
hm76rj4,DifferenceMore5431,11/26/2021,13,$1500 is barely enough for an emergency fund... I think there is something to be said for getting that up to more like $5-10k ASAP.  But after that a match is probably\* free money.  \* if your company has a vesting schedule you should find out what it is. You may have to stay at the company for a certain number of years before they actually let you keep some or all of that match money.
hm8g9sk,Interested_Redditor,11/26/2021,1,Its never too late to ask for a higher salary but itll be tricky depending on the contract language.
hm7xwdf,Pixilatedlemon,11/26/2021,1,Haha some people like that stuff no joke
hm7057p,unchinhairs,11/26/2021,3,What exactly do you need the 2k for - security deposit? Movers? Furniture? I ask because there may be some items you can get after you move thus reducing how much money you need upfront.  How much do you get on a typical paycheck? How much is rent in the areas you are looking at?  If you do need all $2k and your current income is not sufficient you have to get more money. That may mean working a second job - some retail locations hire just for the holiday season so you might be in luck at the moment.
hm7ger2,s4gres,11/26/2021,1,You literally earn 50% instantly if you invest in the 401k. If you can put money anywhere it should be there.
hm7fpm4,DBCOOPER888,11/26/2021,1,>Me? Id get my emergency fund in order with a quickness before maxing out retirement matching.  But if you truly needed the money you could go for an early withdrawal of the matching portion pay the fee and taxes and still come out ahead than if you didnt invest to the match in the first place. Thats a guaranteed 100% return off the bat.
hm6wn3k,rowrowrowurbutt,11/26/2021,1,Very good points thank you. Unfortunately she doesnt receive enough SSI to cover rent its just enough for monthly groceries really.
hm8gfm9,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,If you bought the car from some random person for $50 and sold it for $5000 you would owe capital gains tax on $4950.  This is because your cost basis would be $50 so everything above $50 is profit.  But you were sold the car for $50 by your parents and given a gift of equity for the difference between what the car was worth and $50.  So as long as the car was worth more then $5000 when your parents gifted you the equity in the car you wont owe taxes.  If the car was worth more then the gift tax exclusion limit in the year they gifted you equity in the car then they should have filed gift tax forms with their taxes but otherwise there is no paper trail needed for this.

hm89jpn,Buttigieg2032,11/26/2021,1,A little known truth but very well known by the banks themselves (I‚Äôm an executive director at a bank) is that senior citizens who own their house and live off social security are pretty much judgement proof and don‚Äôt actually have to pay back their debts‚Ä¶banks have to lend to them due to age discrimination reasons‚Ä¶.but ya what your grandparents doing is a thing and not actually irrational.
hm7c7w8,andy20167,11/26/2021,1,I would really love a salary where that is possible haha
hm6wknk,TesticularTentacles,11/26/2021,2,This is the path.  State Labor Boards dint mess around and Federal Labor Laws (if youre in the US) will be used to make sure employers comply with all standards.  That includes paying you for work done.  Document every phone call and name times and dates and make your case.  The money will appear.  Best of luck!
hm86uyo,sirzoop,11/26/2021,1,It is considered capital gains. The cost basis is based off of the price you pay for it. Stop spreading false information.

hm7i3b8,redman2532,11/26/2021,1,I used to work in banking for a large organization- specifically in online bill pay. For bill pay  some banks send a trust check which is debited from your account via ach then when cashed funds would be taken from the corporate trust account. On this your bank would need to investigate and provide a check number. If not cashed in x amount of days (normally 90) funds should get sent back to your account. Very similar to a cashiers check.   Others send a direct check which comes out of your account when the check is actually cashed. If the funds were never taken from your account then you had direct checks. This is the same as you writing a check and would have your account and routing number on the MICR line on bottom of check.    Sounds like either way landlord didnt cash check.   Your bank or bill pay team should be able to provide a check number whether trust or direct. If the funds cleared your account either way you can determine if someone else cashed it or just got misplaced.  Since u have a copy of check it would seem it was cashed. The bank can initiate a trace on check to see where funds were routed to.  Either way dont pay landlord again until you determine what happened
hm8tqz5,Fizzicyst,11/26/2021,3,We had a similar problem with our landlord back in 2009. Fortunately we have always paid them with a cashiers check drawn from our credit union. When they tried to sue us we brought the records of all the checks and the one we supposedly didnt send was in fact cashed by them.  The judge took one look at our records and asked them if they had seen it. They said yes but they still thought we owed them a month. The case was thrown out and they were ordered to pay our costs.
hm7ykjl,JigglyBuddha1991,11/26/2021,1,Yup. 9 years in the Army 31 series (a long time ago) and have been in telecom ever since
hm7742i,bearcat_murse,11/26/2021,2,How sure are you about that $150k NP salary? Not saying it‚Äôs impossible but in many areas I‚Äôve worked in the NP field is saturated therefore salaries are MUCH lower than that to start.

hm8r44d,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,19,Thank you for your concern. I‚Äôm well prepared from a personal defense standpoint. I‚Äôm not saying that carrying and knowing how to use a firearm is going to save your life but it‚Äôs an effective tool to at least mount a defense.   Restraining orders are like laws. Criminals don‚Äôt care about laws.
hm709dy,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,Thanks for the suggestion. Ireland sorta has student loans but it requires a guarantor which I didnt have (super low-income family). The country mostly has a really generous grant scheme but its designed to get you up through levels of education i.e. undergrad --> masters. I looked into getting a grant again but I have a masters already and I couldnt get it for a second masters even if itll be more career relevant
hm7glpq,LilacStreetCapital,11/26/2021,1,That‚Äôs a good reason. However why do you feel compelled to buy your mother a house? Renting her a small apartment or renting a larger apartment with her are both valid options.
hm86bnd,Rear_ended_old_car,11/26/2021,1,Probably about 5 mph not more than 10 mph for sure. My car is a Toyota Camry 02.   The taillight housing isnt cracked. The taillight bulb isnt working not sure if I didnt put in the new one correctly or if the wiring got damaged somehow.   As for the bumper it looks like her license plate bolts left an imprint and a minor dent. Otherwise I didnt see anything significant (though this did happen in the evening I might see more damage come day time.)
hm88uze,QuitProfessional5437,11/26/2021,1,The market went down today but it didnt go down as much as it did in March 2020 when lockdown in the US was announced.    I would hold. Why would you sell when the market dips? You gotta ride the wave.
hm73dkk,BodhiDMD,11/26/2021,3,Only other thing to weigh would be if your company has a vesting schedule. Example: you‚Äôre 20% vested after year one 100% vested after year 5 (get to keep X% of the bonus contributions). If you only plan on being at this job a couple years it could change the math.

hm8gt05,Cruian,11/26/2021,1,The 4% is for $25000+. There are accounts available with rates up to 6% for low balances only (like the first $1000).  &#x200B  It looks like this place charges a $70 annual fee (or worse if done month to month). For people getting in now there is that one time $99 lifetime option but that option is only available until the end of the year.  &#x200B  I didnt follow it too closely but is Fair doing something different than that Robinhood savings attempt? I believe SIPC didnt like the Robinhood offering.
hm6wpcp,Its-a-write-off,11/26/2021,2,No the name change wont qualify then.
hm6urav,limitless__,11/26/2021,3,Have you gone to multiple mortgqge brokers?  At the the end of the day if you want the house by yourself you need to qualify to get the mortgage by yourself.  If you make enough to qualify you need to find a mortgage company who will play ball.  Them saying they want your wife on the loan is nonsense since you are literally divorcing.

hm7v8jx,interstat,11/26/2021,1,I moved from Japan to USA then went to Japanese high school in America for two years and then American high school for junior and senior year.  Met my now wife in high school. We went to seperate colleges and secondary schools I am an optometrist she is an internal medicine/shelter vet.  I went to state school she went to Cornell. Basically we did our 4 years then another 4 years with her + another 4 for specialty.  Essentially for us tho it was keeping costs low. I was making 110k out of optometry school and living with a coworkers family for 150 dollars a month. My job paid for 3 meals a day phone etc and I was on bumblefuck TN. I  had essentially everything to live for free and no family in America so I basically saved everything.(scholarship and job paid for school same with wife).  My wife lived with her sisters family for free making 170k . Against essentially savings everything.  This gave us a war chest of heavy investments that after 6 years we cashed out some of and bought a house with cash  Now we still live in rural area so cost of living is low in general but no debt no mortgage i drive my 2011 Mazda 6 and she drives a 2008ish Honda pilot. Having no need to buy things to live we can spend 70k on luxuries which is insane but still save the rest of our money   Without the war chest while saving super cheap wed never have been in this situation
hm7m3mz,CoeusDarksoul,11/26/2021,1,Billpay services are not all the same. Generally speaking Billpay only sends via ACH if the recipient is setup to receive ACHes and not all Billpay services have the same criteria for how the recipients qualify. Some only accept registered companies some only accept business accounts with routing+acct numbers provided by the sender some let you send via ACH regardless. If the recipient cannot receive ACH for any of the above reasons or something related to how their Financial Institution handles ACHes then BillPay will send a paper check. Again this fluctuates based on service/FI and they may be setup to pre-debit or debit directly from the senders account when the physical check is cashed. Those arent even all of the options there are multiple BillPay service providers and each of them have multiple various service packages with different features & functionality.  Please dont assume your experience is ubiquitous and state it as fact.  Source: Worked 15 years in banking with 4 in Operations including multiple BillPay service conversions involving multiple service providers and analysis and evaluation of their various service packages and what features are & arent available.

hm7uzmk,redapoluza,11/26/2021,1,I really dont think i overpaid by much when i got it. My biggest mistake was taking a 6yr loan and it devaluating in price quicker than i was building equity.   I didnt know of the exsisting rust issues which is definetely my fault. But at the time of purchase it was only 7 years old and had 70k on it with tons of nice aftermarket  options. I had shopped around and it was the best option i found for a used truck near my town

hm7k1vy,tastygluecakes,11/26/2021,1,401k is great for company matching.  IRA is great for flexible of fund choices (and low expenses).    As long as you are maxing out the company match then put the rest in your IRA.  If you max that out and want more retirement savings go back to the 401k

hm7kn63,PeeCeeJunior,11/26/2021,1,It‚Äôs sad isn‚Äôt it? $65k isn‚Äôt enough for two kids to go to college.   The oldest daughter has free tuition as part of a lottery funded scholarship in our state. We just pay for housing food books and fees and even then we‚Äôll have to top off another $10k before she graduates.   The youngest doesn‚Äôt really want to go to a traditional college so she‚Äôll go to a vocational school. If there‚Äôs money left over I guess we‚Äôll pay taxes on it. That or buy her the most awesome computer for ‚Äòschool‚Äô money can buy.

hm6ums8,Aleyla,11/26/2021,1,You have a fair amount of work ahead of you.       Go to a site like cars.com.  Find your vehicle get as close to it as possible - year mileage features even color.  Try to find 3 or so for sale.   Average their prices and that should give you an idea of what yours is worth.       $20k of damage is quite a bit and it will likely be totaled.  When the insurance company gives you their offer ask them for the ‚Äúcomps‚Äù. That stands for comparables.  This is what their offer is going to be based on.  If the value they offer isn‚Äôt roughly what you found in your research then push back for more.        Good luck.
hm89us2,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/26/2021,1,I bonds currently 7%.  Tied up money for a year.  Loans are at a rate that I personally would pay it off but only after maxing out tax advantaged investments.

hm7wswc,JhihnX,11/26/2021,1,A fair number of landlords still require paper checks mailed. It usually isn‚Äôt by choice.
hm88l12,footballer2323,11/26/2021,1,The free money from the company match is only available if you contribute the 6%.  Theres very few scenarios where you dont come out ahead by putting in that full 6%.  Id strongly suggest doing that.  If you really have only $1500 between you and the so-called emergency then building that up should be next.  With 52k less 6% you have over 4k per month to work with.  Since this is a new job your expenses are probably lower than this new salary and if you keep them low for a few months you can get your emergency fun to a level you feel comfortable.  Also with a new job you may be able to get some credit card (dont run a balance) that will also give you an emergency cushion if you ever need it.  The student loans will depend on the interest rate.  if its low pay them back as slow as they will allow and put that money in your tax advantaged 401k.  The contributions limits are annual and you will lose whatever you dont use.  Later in your career you will hopefully make more salary and you can pay the remaining loans then but you cannot go back and invest.  Use time to your advantage.  On the other hand if the student loan interest rates are high and you cannot consolidate for a low rate then you probably want to knock those out quickly.  This is about the only case where Id leave the 401k contribution at 6% and pour everything you can into eliminating the high interest loans.  Most financial advisers are glorified salesmen so dont worry what they recommend.  Most of their advice is garbage.
hm8pp44,Tamerecon,11/26/2021,-19,Was it PNC BANK? Lol I had a female bank teller sending me friend request after i deposited some money on my account in july ! I would always ask if i could take lollipops for my children and she would tell me how she loved lollipops too.  When I would go drop silver bars at the location safe she will always wave at me! She got fired after i notified the branch ! She was going too far! Nonetheless I did accept her friend request
hm8ivh6,iOS34,11/26/2021,1,The mobile home itself will depreciate in value. Like someone else said if it is sitting on land the land that you own as well it will appreciate.
hm8njio,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,>But there are several rules specific to houses that let you reduce or eliminate that capital gain.  The most common two are that if you buy another house with the gains you dont have to pay taxes and if you lived there for 2 out of the last 5 years you can reduce the capital gain buy 250k per person or 500k per married couple.  But those exceptions to capital gains are specific to house and do not apply to other forms of capital gains.  that if you buy another house with the gains you dont have to pay taxes -- this doesnt apply to the sale of personal residences only to investment property and then only if the 1031 exchange is executed correctly.
hm6tts2,DrGreenMeme,11/26/2021,1,> The bottom of the chart where it has the asterisk makes it seem like there is less of a return for your investment the older you get.  But I could just be misinterpreting the numbers.  The chart comes from The Money Guy show and is just a conservative estimate. Over the short term (the closer you get to 65) the more volatile your investment could be so they‚Äôre just trying to represent a realistic expectation.  > Knowing to invest in an index fund is more helpful than just saying ‚Äúinvest‚Äù. My ex was a financial advisor but he recommended Chinese stock and invested in Doge coin so I‚Äôll probably ask a different one.  Yeah I should‚Äôve made that clear. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor but I know that the majority of them would say index funds specifically the S&P500 are considered safe but powerful investments. I would never recommend someone invest in crypto or single stocks unless they are using a very small amount of their portfolio and realize the risks.

hm6wtf1,doktorhladnjak,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôm not saying that will happen. My point is yes sometimes markets are flat or go down for 20 years. Investing in the market is not a sure thing even over fairly long timeframes.

Holding money on the side instead of paying doesn‚Äôt make sense but investing probably makes sense.

hm8rsw5,Mellytoo,11/26/2021,12,This is horrifying. Listen if this person has contacted you they surely have contacted others. Likely others who wouldnt think to ask whether this is ok on Reddit.  Call your bank now. Like asap. This is a security issue...like call the 24 hour number on your card now. Then follow up in person tomorrow. If you do not feel comfortable going to the branch because you are worried about running into this person go to another branch.  Also screenshot that message now before you make the call and before you are blocked on messenger.  Please consider all of the information this person has on you. Your bank has all of your personal info right down to probably your mothers  maiden name. Make that call immediately.
hm8fifj,WeSellStuffonAmazon,11/26/2021,1,Clever way around it is to sell it and not report it anywhere.   The taxman isn‚Äôt going to come after you for selling a car. The taxman may be curious why your parents took a tax write off to sell a car to a family member for well below market but that‚Äôs unlikely to be an issue either.   The correct way to do it is to report it as a short term or long term capital gain depending on how long you owned it for but I don‚Äôt think I personally would worry about it.
hm7r6ri,pm_me_ur_bamboozle,11/26/2021,1,You need cash in the bank. Youre 24 dont use your parents as a backup. Get 10k in a savings account and then invest the rest.

hm86kg2,sfennix,11/26/2021,1,130 per month extra contribution between 3% and 6%. Essentially If you contribute the extra 3% to get the matching you are gaining $1560 free money per year plus any gains in the retirement account.    That extra savings of $1560 per year of reduced retirement contribution isnt going to suddenly increase your savings/emergency fund. It is not going to pay off your loans but it will make a difference in that retirement account. Dont turn down the matching. Money into your retirement early is far better that money in your retirement account later.

It wasnt my first paycheck I had been working there for like 2 years at that school district  and it was just odd to have a paycheck be 5 days late.

hm73skp,PCMR_GHz,11/26/2021,2,I was like you working dead end jobs and not knowing what to do with myself after highschool. I joined the army with the intent on ‚Äúfeeling it out‚Äù and if I didn‚Äôt like it I would just take my GI Bill and run. Turns out I didn‚Äôt care for the military but I learned a lot of skills gained self respect disciplined myself was in great shape as well. I doubt I would have been able to complete my degree if I didn‚Äôt go into the military. Best of all I left college with no debt whatsoever and was able to get a VA Home Loan and bought a house shortly after starting a career.
hm8is7l,cvvhip,11/26/2021,1,You‚Äôre missing out on free cash that to me is the mistake. You should be trying to max your 401k contribution every year that‚Äôs easier said than done maxing the match should be bare minimum.   All that being said what‚Äôs the rate on the loan after February? If it‚Äôs higher than the 3% match you‚Äôre better off (not taking into any consideration the benefits of investing) paying that down rather than putting it into you‚Äôre 401K. This is a general rule for life. Debt seems bad and scary it is not. Debt can be bad very very bad (high interest credit cards). It can also be great (low interest home loan). Later in life if you have extra cash should you repay your mortgage faster? To lay down debt? Maybe. If the interest rate of your mortgage is higher than the rate of return on an ETF than paying extra on your mortgage is actually costing you money. Better to take the extra cash and invest it.
hm8r7s1,DarSwanSwede,11/26/2021,5,Actually the reason we America s are in this quandary is simple. We established the first systems and it truly has not been updated but rather patched over since the very early days of ATMs 1976- to present. My FI that I worked at for 20+ years still to this day has an old UNIX terminal and it wasn‚Äôt till just a few years ago they left machines that were programmed with Cobal and Fortran so.. üòÇ let that soak in this FI is measured in billions too . New countries like South Africa began their FI journey at a much later time like other countries at time when the internet was already established the tech was already invented so they jumped headlong into Dip cards and contactless skipping 40 years ahead and I‚Äôve seen their systems very impressive and very futuristic. We will catch up we just have to get all the mom and pop gas stations stores businesses to all switch. It‚Äôs taken huge strides just to get this far.

Either way you‚Äôre not really going to make anything off this.  If it‚Äôs economical to repair your check will be equal to the repair bill often paid directly to the repair shop.  If totaled they give you a check for the value and keep the car.  Basically they buy the car.

hm8bu0y,Kiyae1,11/26/2021,1,Typically you should always contribute up to your employer‚Äôs match otherwise you aren‚Äôt collecting your complete and total compensation package.   It‚Äôs also usually a foundational piece of financial advice to contribute as much as possible as young as possible since time-in-market is usually the biggest determining factor in the amount of growth your investment will experience.   Everyone‚Äôs financial priorities will be different. To put this in context 2% of $52000 annually is about an extra $1040 every year for you to put towards student loans and savings (it‚Äôs actually less than $1040 because of taxes). But increasing your 401k contribute 2% will add $2080 to your investments/retirement savings which will have about an extra 5-10 years to grow in value compared to many of your peers who won‚Äôt start contributing until their thirties.
hm7i5rj,The-WideningGyre,11/26/2021,1,Did you ask him why you shouldnt contribute the full match?  Im with most others -- contribute the full match youre getting an instant 50% return on your investment (and tax-advantaged!) you can get it out if you really need to and its likely not the difference if something happens anyway.

hm8fauq,jellicle,11/26/2021,1,It was a common bank tactic to run debits in order from largest to smallest followed by credits. If the largest debit overdrafts the account then each small debit incurs an extra overdraft fee. There has been some pushback against this but I think most banks still do this. It absolutely is by design.  Banks make most of their money from fees such as these not interest on loans they make.
hm7cgg4,FarioLimo,11/26/2021,4,You see your father as a safety net but maybe hes telling you in a friendly way that you should take care of your life like the adult you are. Which means not run to them and control your finances.  He seems Iike a very reasonable person.
hm8rl94,jakep623,11/26/2021,3,Jeezem worked as a personal banker/teller for just about three years and never once did i do anything like that or even think/consider to do this.   Its not normal. I dont think you are wrong feeling the way that you do either. Idk. Id judge the situation based on the teller. If you sense bad intent/sharky behavior report it. Else freeze credit close all your accounts and go to a big bank like Chase...

hm78pof,spanctimony,11/26/2021,-1,Nah Dad is still the super backup emergency fund. He should ignore Dad and contribute up to the match.
hm72lyx,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,It means the former employer can still turn the loan into an early withdrawal but the new laws let him pay it back like a normal 401k rollover until Oct 2022.
hm7b2s6,enigma_goth,11/26/2021,1,Education is worth it. Get that college degree. You can finance with a student loan and some employers even help with tuition if you go part time. In the long term you will get better paying jobs and not be stuck in blue collar mostly manual work (unless that‚Äôs what you want). Wouldn‚Äôt you rather be older with a college education than none at all? Military is hard life. You are still very young get that education before life becomes more complicated and it will get more difficult to go back to school.
hm7bx87,Edraitheru14,11/26/2021,1,No a hardship withdrawal when you cant even survive a month on your savings isnt going to stop a lot of the bad things from happening to you.  Youre not going to significantly miss out on anything by abstaining from 2% of a match for a few months or a year while you build yourself a safety net.   Better to build and have that safety net NOW so you dont have to make expensive mistakes later to cover your ass if things go wrong.  I think the dad has the right idea here. Once hes got his emergency savings in order absolutely contribute max match ASAP.
hm7umea,GreedyNovel,11/26/2021,1,Well I dont think theyre good for an e-fund either because you cant withdraw them for the first year. The whole point of an e-fund is being able to withdraw on demand at any time.  >I can‚Äôt think of another reason why a FA would advise against I-bonds for an E-fund  Maybe there is a good reason you havent thought of?

hm7za51,One-Kind-Word,11/26/2021,1,Because: The property is on the west side of the country and I and my daughters live on the east side. Because: I‚Äôm getting older with some health problems. Because: It‚Äôs been hard finding comp properties and my daughters would have an even harder time since it‚Äôs a 20 acre piece with a creek running along the west border. A creek that only runs 9 months of the year but it means wells in the area don‚Äôt have to be deep saving money. Any property in Arizona with any creek is rather special.  I have 3 potential buyers even though I‚Äôve never put it on the open market. If I listed it the commission on raw land is 10% and I don‚Äôt think any offer would bring in much more. It is an unknown though. The buyer I‚Äôve accepted is an abutting neighbor.  The last reason is because I would get a kick out of giving my daughters some funds while I‚Äôm alive. I still own 31 acres in the northwestern area of Arizona and I want to put that in trust for my kids. That will be easier to sell.

hm8evr7,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,>Yes your rates will likely go up if you do.  Adding drivers does not automatically make rates go up.  Generally speaking if there are more car than drivers adding a driver should only increase the rates if they are a higher risk driver than the ones already on the policy.  Since we dont know OP or their mothers age/driving records we can only assume.  But in general rates go down as you age so unless OPs mother has accidents/tickets then their rates should stay about the same or possibly go down some.  >You have to have collision coverage to get it  This totally depends on your insurance company but most will offer comprehensive without collision.
hm6s716,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,Losses always offset gains and after that you can deduct $3000 of losses from your regular income. The rest carries over to the next year  So for e.g. $30k capital gains $100k capital losses. You dont pay taxes on those gains subtract $3k from your income and roll over $67k for next year.

hm7p1iu,PaulR504,11/26/2021,1,I assume this is prompted by people posting these famcy vacations or trips online and you feel like you are missing out?   From my experience a lot of that is debt financed and few and far between. You are doing the right thing no matter how odd it seems.

hm74uug,ChrisHisStonks,11/26/2021,8,Id say to spend a few months building out your savings and then upping it to 6% after that. Especially if you dont have the luxury of being able to put aside much money. If you can easily save 1k a month with the matching then I agree with the people below that its free money and you should definitely max out.
hm6sxm9,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,You want to use the card once or twice a year so it doesnt get closed for inactivity. Doesnt matter if its the main card or the authorized user card.  They might not send replacement AU cards if they dont have any use. Ive had that happen with some bank debit cards. Theyve expired and didnt get replaced unless I contacted them about it.
hm85fhd,webbwbb,11/26/2021,1,Just a thought perhaps it could help op if you shared your agents nmls id so they can work with someone familiar with the process for this unique situation.

hm8dlho,claytonsprinkles,11/26/2021,1,Chase does this. The check issued is considered guaranteed funds like a cashiers check.
hm79deo,aaaaij,11/26/2021,2,Absolutely! At just what income that falls depends on a lot of factors including your guess at how tax laws will change in the future making it impossible to really know where that threshold really is for you but it definitely exists.  The way progressive tax structures like the one we use in the US works is you pay a higher and higher effective rate as your income increases. As a result your lifelong tax burden is lowest if your taxable income is the same each year of your life. If your income varies widely from year to year your lifelong tax burden is more for the same total lifelomg income. Switching from Roth to pre-tax as their income increases is how people manage that for optimal tax efficiency
hm6xedq,skinnedalmond,11/26/2021,3,We were a family of 8 so his paycheck was stretched thin. What his pension is now is probably what he was making back when we were were growing up.   Plus he‚Äôs been working there for almost 35 years. His pension is probably enough to get him by for retirement but im trying to figure out how he can start investing.   My mom has a chronic illness so it‚Äôs important to us that they have a cushion as well
hm828z8,Coin_Boi,11/26/2021,1,After your monthly expenses and maximizing contributions are you still able to put money aside in savings to build an emergency fund?  If you can max out your contributions and still live comfortably then you should definitely at minimum meet your company match otherwise your losing the money your company is offering.
hm6t8nl,EatYourCheckers,11/26/2021,3,IMO its best to start when you have the motivation and momentum once they start they will continue. If they put it off it might get forgotten about.

hm8gv3w,Shikyoookami,11/26/2021,1,As someone who used to work for a call center in the bank let me tell this is a big problem. He took it upon himself to message you a complete stranger to ask for money. When I was working for the bank I could easily access any account I wanted to just needed the account number or some other details you honestly didn‚Äôt need to be there for me to do anything. While everything is monitored it doesn‚Äôt stop him from gaining access to your account if he wanted to.  You did the right thing transferring your money out to another account first thing tomorrow would be go down to the branch and speak to the branch manager. You may need to open a new account with a new account number but I would speak to the branch manager first and see what they recommend also if you do any online banking change your information like your login ID and password just to be safe about. Keep an eye on your credit and possibly you may want to consider freezing it just so you don‚Äôt run the risk of anything happening our systems would allow me to look at your social security number this is the only reason I‚Äôm suggesting it. Your bank may be different than where I worked which was Bank of America but better safe than sorry.

hm8inek,littlebuffkin,11/26/2021,1,As I said ‚Äúif something goes wrong or 5 things as it often does there isn‚Äôt wiggle room‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt lay out my complete finances I just said the expenses relevant to OPs situation it doesn‚Äôt leave you wiggle room when 1) your pet needs a $3K surgery 2) you get mugged and have to replace your belongings and 3) you have emergency medical procedure with a $5K deductible and 4) both vehicles need new tires which is what happened in my case.   There‚Äôs a reason 30% is the high end of the standard because life happens. 40% doesn‚Äôt give you a lot of wiggle room. And we have no student loans owe on one car and had no credit card debt. Like I said I made it but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.  Also our original interest rate was about 4% if I remember right we did have to pay PMI as we put $20K down taxes are low in my area no HOA homeowners insurance isn‚Äôt high. So idk why it doesn‚Äôt add up for you but that‚Äôs what it was. My credit was in the high 700s my husbands was in the low 700s but only about 6 months old so that didn‚Äôt help.

hm78v4v,Varathien,11/26/2021,1,The Citi Custom Cash gives you 5% cash back on your highest spending category.   Its a pretty good combo with the Chase Freedom Flex since you can use the Custom Cash for your highest category that the Freedom Flex isnt covering.   The Citi Double Cash is a good card to use for everything else that isnt one of the 5% categories.

hm7t3s0,Rockdef80,11/26/2021,1,Depends on how much you like the car. Same thing happened to me in my 99 Camry. I loved that car and when I was rear ended her insurance offered me $600.

hm7mp4h,kbfprivate,11/26/2021,1,No disagreement there. OP isn‚Äôt really clear on their financial situation. Is the $15k student loan at 6-8%? Who knows. Too many factors to tell.  Likely it‚Äôs not a high paying job so in the end it‚Äôs really not going to move the needle much.
hm874hy,Rubb-a-dub,11/26/2021,1,Been there done that!  1.5% is a super cheap loan by comparison US Govt I-bonds are presently at a tad over 7%.

hm73jwj,Smokey_Katt,11/26/2021,2,The ‚Äútreated as an eligible rollover‚Äù part makes me think you are correct roll over the pension to a Roth IRA for each of them put it in a low fee index fund and done.  But depending on what 590-B says it might have to be a traditional IRA too.  Otherwise you might have to pay income tax on the $40k.    Check to see if you can transfer like $10k a year from regular to Roth and not pay taxes on that since they will have no other income.    Don‚Äôt forget to think about state taxes depending on your state.
hm74w3k,Jsand117,11/26/2021,10,This is definitely fraud. Once the person has passed the card and contract is no longer valid.

hm77me8,crazy_rex40k,11/26/2021,1,>Small landlords get a lot of shit on Reddit. Im still not sure why.   Because any landlord small or big has a LOT of power over your life. Small landlords often treat it as a passive side income and dont expect to live up to their end of the deal.      Ive had a landlord steal my damage deposit (no damage said shed return it just never did stopped answering my calls) and another whom I rented a room from for ten months who forgot that it was a 10 month lease and kicked me out after eight months to move in new tenants.

hm8a7bn,littlebuffkin,11/26/2021,1,I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. When we bought our house our mortgage was $2300 and our take home was about $5-6K and it was miserably tight. You don‚Äôt realize all of the other expenses that go up when you get more space maybe it would be lest bad on a condo. But we literally had no wiggle room and one thing went wrong (more like 5 because it always happens that way) and I had to pick up a second job to help us get stable. Eventually we refinanced our mortgage down to $1800 and our take home pay went up to about $7-8000 and we are more comfortable. If you are willing to be house poor you can do it that‚Äôs what we did for much the same reason you have. Our area has exploded our home was $350K in 2019 and now appraised at $475K so I have no regrets but it was really uncomfortable

You can buy fractional mutual fund shares by default.  ETFs (VTI VXUS VT) at Vanguard must be bought as whole shares.  >I wish I could just set it and forget it.  Mutual funds do offer auto investing though may require you to have bought into the fund initially before you can set that up.

hm6x4as,Assurgavemeabrother,11/26/2021,1,If along with being a US person youre a citizen of an Ibero-American country or a national of Puerto Rico you have a right for Spanish citizenship only after 2 years of residency in Spain and in this case Spain permits dual citizenship (while ordinary naturalized citizen of Spain must previously renounce all previous citizenships). As Spain is a member of EU Spanish citizenship would allow to reside anywhere in EU afaik.
hm6txph,continue_improve,11/26/2021,1,At 70/80k you can afford a 250k house. Ideally you‚Äôd want to keep mortgage less than 3x your salary.   What‚Äôs the loan other than your car loan? I generally think you should be free of those debts before you go and buy a house. I would pay those off using your 56k savings right away and then save up for the downpayment to buy the house.
hm7jxof,Just_the_typto,11/26/2021,1,I kind of dislike the term saving because that means like a savings account to most... Id say 10% weekly until you have know what you made this year from your tax return. Once you know that you can divide it by 12 and then take 15% of that and invest it this way assuming you make more the next year you are putting about 10% in. If you are young high risk is the way

Only problem is if youre personally involved as a beneficiary you might have to go to court about his estate. Also just because you MAKE a document doesnt mean you have to SHOW people... youd need a lawyer anyway. But said document COULD make things a lot easier on you.

hm783wx,Macluawn,11/26/2021,0,It depends. 401k can have high fees.   * 100$ at 8% a year for 40 years is 2172$  * 200$ (100$ with a a 100% match) at 6% a year over 40 years will get you 2057$  If OP is 18 or 19 contributing to low-fee investments can be better. Shouldn‚Äôt continue past early 20s though  Make compounding your bitch.
hm6zgbz,i_need_a_username201,11/26/2021,3,I‚Äôm not an accountant or anything but tell me of this makes sense:  Have the ‚Äúkids‚Äù cash it out now and they pay ordinary income taxes on it based on their income (10%). Then invest that in a brokerage account and they only have to pay long term capital gains taxes (15%) on the growth when withdrawn. Does that makes sense? If they don‚Äôt pay taxes now they‚Äôll have to pay ordinary income taxes on everything later am I right?  If the kids were adults I would agree with you but since they‚Äôre minors with no income I‚Äôm wondering if getting the taxes out of the way is a good idea. I hope I‚Äôm clear all questions if I‚Äôm not clear.   But again get this confirmed by a pro if my assumptions are wrong it could cost you.
hm870ag,Cruian,11/26/2021,1,>Can you tell me why? Would you do 300 VTSAX and 100 VTIAX?  Diversification. The US isnt always and wont always be the best performing market. If you want I can post 10+ links that should show the benefits of investing internationally.  * https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vtwax  - Global market cap weights. Id argue this should be the default position.  * https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/investment/international-investing  - Vanguard 40% of stock is recommended to be international  >I think I can only do VTI unless I buy a whole share of VTSAX now that I think about it.  VTSAX and VTIAX have initial minimums of $3000. After you buy that initial amount you can invest as little as $1 for future purchases.  VTI and VXUS (the ETF forms) must be traded as whole shares (if Vanguard is your brokerage).  You could simply combine VTI/VTSAX and VXUS/VTIAX into VT or VTWAX which should act very similar to both combined into one at global market cap weights.

hm8s294,kindrudekid,11/26/2021,-9,Honestly write a nice letter and to the point and fax it to the branch manager and corporate.  Sometimes when you call they just wanna be over with and move on. And with todays labor market they might just reprimand him.  And do mention how you can be made whole if you have a mortgage maybe ask for a no cost lower rate loan in exchange for not making a big deal out of it.
hm8eova,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,The quotes for these repairs are most likely by the book.  Dropping the oil pan and tranny pan and replacing the links and seals have large overlaps in labor.  Parts would be about 1k from rock auto all of that can be done in less than 8 hours and none of it is very technical so anyone mechanically inclined should be able to do the work.  If you find a mechanic moonlighting that wants some extra weekend cash you can probably get this all fixed for $1500 if you wanted to keep it.
hm75x1m,CorporalPunishment23,11/26/2021,2,Interesting take. But if youre just an authorized user on an account cant you just dispute that away with not my account? Like I know (or think) the same would be true if I were an AU on a card that was delinquent (belonging legitimately to a living accountholder) because in the end Im not the person who was responsible for making the payment?
hm8cqqy,FlutieFlakes22,11/26/2021,1,But doesnt contributing to vtsax keep you from maxing out your savings for a house? I wanted a house pretty badly straight out of high-school and couldnt stand paying rent knowing it wasnt going towards anything. Ended up saving aggressively buying a house at 23. I could have put more towards retirement but I would have had to rent longer. And my homes value has doubled since I bought it in 2015. Obviously cant predict how real estate vs stock market will perform over the next several years but owning your own house is a great feeling.
hm77yi4,jennystonermeyer,11/26/2021,1,I pay down and like the chase 5% I added to amz and the cash is instantly usable its nice.  If you carry a balance go low interest.

hm8lomq,thentangler,11/26/2021,1,First of all‚Ä¶ make sure the relo ‚Äúbonus‚Äù is pro-rated.. because papa Sam taxes bonuses at 45%. So your $6000 becomes just a little more than $3000 and your $2000 sign in becomes just a little more than $1000.   Regarding your car I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a beater you just used for college‚Ä¶ In an ideal world I would tell you to put some money into it for new batteries and tires and drive it to CO. It would be around $1200 anyways.  However you now have a job and need a reliable mode of transport.  The prices of cars aren‚Äôt going to come down in the next year until the semiconductor supply is back to normal‚Ä¶. I would suggest you shop around for used cars‚Ä¶ but compare with new cars too. You never know‚Ä¶.
hm7os74,cmgr33n3,11/26/2021,1,I would try to convert this into real amounts look at those amounts and the role they play in my life and then decide which I thought was more important for its role (or if some % of both was the better option). Both the actual amounts and the different roles (cash on hand in savings vs retirement savings) are important in making the decision. Below is an attempt at determining the actual amounts you would be considering.  Retirement:  * 401K contributions are pre-tax so $52000 / 12 = $4333.33 per month x 2% (0.02) = $86.66    * This is how much per month comes out of your earning for every 2% you funnel into your retirement (so multiply by 2 for 4% or 3 for 6%). * $86.66 x 2 (company match) = $173.33    * This is how much per month actually would be deposited into your retirement account for every 2% you funnel into your retirement account (dont add bullet 1 and 2 together that would be a double match) * At even a conservative 5% return (fyi: this is a more concervative rate than I use for my own thought experiments like this) that $173 a month (assuming you continued to save/invest it in your 401k the entire time) would be:    * $2133 after 1 year ($1039.92 from your salary $1039.92 from the companys the match $53.16 from investment earnings)    * $4375 after 2 years ($2079.84 from your salary $2079.84 from the companys the match $215.32 from investment earnings)    * $11 814 after 5 years ($5199.60 from your salary $5199.60 from the companys the match $1414.80 from investment earnings)  Savings:  * Putting money in a savings account is after-tax money.  And because taxes work in brackets rather than flat overall rates it takes a little work to figure out what percentage of that $86.66 per month in earnings youd actually be putting into a savings account (the reality is a little more complex than just deducting your fed taxes but IMO this gets you close enough for making a decision).    * At $52000 per year you pay $4664 in taxes on your first $40525 in earnings and 22% on the last $11475. $11475 x 22% (0.22) = $2524.50.  Your total federal income tax bill would then be $4664 + - $2524.50 = $7188.50.    * Your total federal income tax bill ($7188.50) divided by your total income ($52000) is your effective tax rate which is the percentage of tax you pay per dollar you earn. $7188.50 / $52000 = 13.82%    * $86.88 x 13.82% (0.1382) = $11.98. So you pay $11.98 on every $86.88 you earn meaning you keep $74.90 (lets just round that to $75.00) * Savings accounts are typically between 0-1% APY (annual percentage yeild so how much interest accrued in a 12 month span). Putting $75 a month into a savings account at 1% APY results in following (again assuming you continue to save that amount the entire time):    * $905 after 1 year ($900 from your salary $5 from savings interest)    * $1819 after 2 years ($1800 from your salary $19 from savings interest)    * $4616 after 5 yeas ($4500 from your salary $116 from savings interest)  The calculations above were reached using the information you provided [a listing of the federal income tax brackets for 2021](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets) and a [basic compound interest calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/compound-savings-calculator-tool.aspx).

hm8j8o2,SnooSketches4722,11/26/2021,1,Even worse if you receive notification from Venmo that the email you received about funds sent you was not intended for you they do absolutely nothing. They claim they can‚Äôt cancel it nor notify the sender. I handle customer support for a niche software program that handles orders for micro-businesses. Sometimes their customers miss all of the various areas their service provider‚Äôs email is listed on their invoice and incoming email sent through our system and instead somehow send it to our noreply email. Only Cash App had the sender‚Äôs contact info so I can notify the sender they need to cancel and resend to their provider. All the others don‚Äôt and their customer service can not help in anyway. There isn‚Äôt even enough info to match it up to the provider (our customer) so we can‚Äôt even notify them to identify and inform their customer. These payments just sit unclaimed until whatever amount times passes that the processor finally cancels it out and returns the funds.

hm8j9me,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,So theyre taking about a third. This makes sense if you consider: 7.65% for SS/Medicare \~15% for Fed income tax withholding \~6% for NY income tax withholding and \~4% for NYC withholding = 32.65%.  Make sure that youre aware that aside from the SS/Medicare the withholdings are typically estimates. If you have more withheld than you owe on your tax return youll get a refund. If you have less withheld that you owe on your tax return youll have to pay the balance when you file your return.
hm8efr7,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,1,Probably a good idea. I had planned to call but it would be easier to show the message in person.
hm6sa4i,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,2,Yes you can do your plan.  Some things to be aware of.  * Who is the account owner?  The Family or You?  This person has ultimate control over the 529 and can change the beneficiary at any time. * Each individual part in your plan is legal (You are allowed to gift family money.  Family is allowed to gift money to a 529 with Son as beneficiary).  However a Gift is basically defined by the IRS as something with no strings attached.  If the expectation is to use the family member as a pass through this may no longer be considered a gift.  Additionally the *intent* of the money transfer was to circumvent taxation.  You may be starting to get into an area referred to as tax evasion. * https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/529-plan-gifts-may-be-deductible-from-state-income-tax

hm7vqni,RealMccoy13x,11/26/2021,1,Liable was the wrong word. I apologize I answer so CFPB related questions and most relate to loss. In this case it would be just not in your favor instead of liable.

hm8jkcu,hawkxp71,11/26/2021,1,Unfortunately this is a problem with this style of autopay.  The other style where they simply print and mail a check  the money doesnt leave your account until its cashed.       The style where they withdraw the monies immediately and make money of the float until its deposited are common for lower cost banks (like credit unions). The other style the costs of mailing are covered by the bank (and passed on to you somehow.....)     Through the years Ive probably had 5 or 6 autopay checks not get delivered.  Before I changed banks from a credit union to a regular bank (US Bank) I had 1 person not receive the check for 3000 dollars or so.  The CU took almost 6 weeks investigating before I got a refund and in the mean time I had to cover 2 checks (I manually sent the second one).     With my bank Ive had it happen I just stop it and then cut a new one.  Not out any money
hm81ng0,kayGrim,11/26/2021,1,No they should not because none of those apps are protected legally in the same way. Frequently people get fucked by using those options due to the lack of recourse when funds go missing and therefore they should not be suggested.
hm8l4sv,Rubily00,11/26/2021,1,You know them better than we do but its very possible youll be seen as meddling or stirring the pot if theyre happy with the way things are.  If they *arent* happy with the way things are then their specific unhappiness is going to decide your path forward. Do they not like having to manage another property? Offer to sell the property to the tenant or put it up on the market. Do they want MORE properties? Sit down with their finances and decide if they can afford a down payment on another one. Do they want to downsize? Move? Start looking for new places to live that fill their wishes. Etc etc.

hm85p92,Piriper0,11/26/2021,1,Joining the military *solely* for financial reasons is a bad call.  Yes there definitely are solid financial benefits and yes youll have some control over what job you do and how that impacts your future trajectory - both are solid points that others have made.  But there are big costs involved too. Theres a good chance youll do permanent long-term damage to your body. You may be called upon to go to war - both China and Russia are making some worrying moves right now. You will give up any autonomy over your time for the duration of your contract - you dont really have time off in the military as the folks you report to can have you perform any kinds of duties on evenings or weekends. And once youre in its very tough to get out - you cant just quit like you would for any normal job. The pay is also quite low for enlisted folks though the benefits (housing medical etc.) somewhat balance that out.   If you think the military would be a good cultural fit for you and the negatives dont bother you too much then it may be a good fit for you. If so absolutely do your research ahead of time about what branch you want and what job you want. Tell the recruiter what you want dont let them tell you what you want.

I did something dumb today and Im trying to figure out the best way to fix. Im switching my cell provider over to Google Fi and purchased a new phone today through the Pixel Pass. What I didnt grasp is that you can purchase the Pixel Pass through the Google Store and through Google Fi.   What I know now is that with Fi it seems like they do a soft credit check and you pay from an bank account monthly. Purchasing though the Google Store requires you to open a line of credit for financing.   Being the fool I am I got all the way through checkout and realized there was not an option to sign up for Google Fi. Got to poking around reached out to Fi support realized I went about things the wrong direction.   Soooo... I didnt complete the checkout though the Google Store and instead did everything through Fi. All is well except I now have an open line of credit Im probably never going to use.   I already have two other credit cards which I use on the reg but never carry over a balance. I also just bought a new house in the last 30 days. I dont particularly like having random lines of credit Im not using hanging out there but Im just not sure what is best to do with my mistake today.   Please help and thank you in advance!
hm87yix,WoodsFinder,11/26/2021,1,You have to make your own decision of course but what I would do for myself is set up payroll deduction into the companys 401k (if they have one) for at least the amount that they match because that match is basically free money. Then Id contribute to a Roth IRA if I could do so and still afford my bills and be able to have some fun.  Id invest the money in both into a broad-based stock index fund (S&P 500 Russell 2000 or a mid-cap fund).
hm6x4y1,zorinlynx,11/26/2021,6,Let me second this. Going the labor board/lawyer way makes sense if youre leaving and they wont give you your last check but if youre just starting youre also trying to create a good first impression and threatening to sic lawyers and the labor board on them aint that.  If this becomes a recurring problem down the line thats different but this is the FIRST check. Give them a chance to fix it.

hm7qww6,spam20,11/26/2021,1,I work in retail banking. Depends on the system they use. A majority of banks will debit your account to issue the check and just assume it was received by the other party. There should be something to help reconcile and confirm the check was deposited/cashed. You might need to ask if you can speak to someone familiar with their online system. Front end people will just see funds were taken and check was issued. Online department should be able to dig a bit further to determine it cashed/deposited. *Should* is the key word. Best of luck.
hm72dqn,SchismSX,11/26/2021,2,Thank you for your service
hm7d4ao,OnlyPostSoUsersXray,11/26/2021,1,Absolutely just like to know what to expect.
hm8cxha,krustymeathead,11/26/2021,1,you file a claim with your insurance. then your insurance will sue their insurance (or sue them if they have no insurance). since you will be marked as not at fault it shouldnt make your insurance premiums go up.
hm73u6v,Stinka27,11/26/2021,1,Add Carguru to the list. I just did the Carmax Vroom Carvana etc. thing. Carmax had the best price but my title was incorrect when I went to sell to them. Was going to DMV the next day to fix title and did a quick Google. Carguru offered a couple thousand more AND they came to pick it up with the check in hand.  Try all of them before you make a decision used cars are going for big money right now.
hm714uh,stillhavingissues,11/26/2021,1,The commenter below is correct.  KBB puts my car at 11k and tesla is giving me almost 14 to trade it in.   I saw a similar model same miles same year for sale on carvana for 17500.   This is a 6 year old car that I paid 23 for brand new.
hm6sknh,Glittering_Pepper_14,11/26/2021,1,My dad doesnt own a computer and he uses BOA and has exact same thing on his statement?
hm780nn,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,4,> Per their terms and conditions they are to respond in 30 days. It has been more than 30 days  Then feel free to file with CFPB because the bank just broke yet another terms.
hm7pcfb,dontlooklikemuch,11/26/2021,1,its done this way because with a normal check your account number is printed on each check so if it gets lost your account can potentially be compromised.  Bill pay removes that possibility by having the bank send a check on your behalf
hm776e9,nowindowsjuslinux,11/26/2021,1,How are you adding $10k to Roth?  Max is $6k.
hm6y5r7,throwaway_eng_fin,11/26/2021,4,There isnt really a right answer at that interest rate level.  Youd be fine if you didnt so long as you have the discipline to do good things with the difference.  Youd also be fine if you did.  The balances are also low enough that they wont make a huge difference on your income to debt ratio for mortgage underwriting.  This is in the personal zone of personal finance.
hm8rb8a,davidm2232,11/26/2021,1,I wish bank apps/sites had the option to put a virtual hold on when you write a physical check. Its impractical to keep a paper balanced checkbook with all the autopay and debit card transaction going in and out of your account. Be nice if when the check was written my bank account could instantly reflect that I had already spent that money
hm6yddz,Will_delete_soon78,11/26/2021,1,I would stay in the house until I decided to move then rent it out! You will own a home and have income. If you sell you have all these fees and taxes to pay.
hm841pr,slayer1am,11/26/2021,1,I recommend watching a few financial youtube channels like the Money Guy Show or Minority Mindset.  Find one that you like and make a habit of watching it regularly.  Finances isnt something to figure out from one reddit post spend some time learning it slowly.       Now youre doing pretty good for 90K a year and only 1200/month in rent.  The key here is to maintain a balance of quality of life and saving for the future.       Starting out your first goal is to get an emergency fund together say two or three months worth of expenses that is kept in a liquid account like checking.       Also check with your company as soon as possible to find out if they do matching contributions to a retirement account if they do its free money and you should max it out.       So retirement accounts:  IRA is Individual Retirement Account it can be either a Roth or a traditional 401K but both are IRAs.  Im not an expert on those and I wont try to educate you here Im sure others will provide a better breakdown.       Once you have the emergency fund saved up and youve figured out which IRA to setup now its time for brokerage accounts.  The point of this account is to provide extra income and grow your savings faster.  Theres lots of good brokerages like Fidelity M1 Finance WeBull etc.  Ideally they should not charge you anything to open the account and also not charge you to trade stocks or funds etc.       I know thats a lot of information but thats why I started out mentioning good youtube channels to follow.  This is going to take time to process and you should not rush it.  We havent even started on taxes........
hm8ayrh,anand2305,11/26/2021,1,This. Have told the same to my kids. Dont get involved in rat race. Earn enough money in few initial years and then go travel the world before coming back to settle back in daily grind. Other advantage is you never know where your destiny takes you to settle down there are millions of opportunities world over.
hm77fys,DeaconPat,11/26/2021,2,Pretty sure the legal onus is on the renter to prove the rent was paid (i.e. money changed hands not just someone mailed a check). IANAL.
hm71x36,timber321,11/26/2021,2,Yeah financial guardianship probably means appointmented by the court. Usually you can only transfer $10k to a parent/guardian without needing a court to be involved.  Is the only option with the pension a one-time payout or is there an installment payout option?  And yeah you are probably going to get a variety of responses depending on who to talk to.
hm6w5az,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,Hey yep I cant be certain when but if I was to guess: thinking Ill get at least a year of working on the new career track here in Ireland and then aim to get back Stateside in summer 2023
hm6v47a,Drill1,11/26/2021,4,It‚Äôs been ten years since she turned 18 and had an accountant doing my taxes back then.  I know that I was asked each year how much I spent on her and how much was saved.  After my daughter turned 18 I got a letter from SSA saying that I needed to repay any money saved plus interest.  I did spend the SS money on her and didn‚Äôt cash in the life insurance policies until she turned 18.  The policies collected interest for 5 years and went from $150k to $190k and the money was tax free.  That‚Äôs why I said check with a tax attorney the laws may have changed.
hm8e80b,KarnWild-Blood,11/26/2021,1,By any chance is the warranty American Home Shield?   If so be VERY wary if you use them. You have to contact them FIRST if you need to take advantage of their coverage and THEY pick the vendor... which means whoever lowballs the job cost. And they accept no responsibility for anything that goes wrong.  Maybe others have had good experiences with such things but I have not and would never advise paying for such a thing.
hm80vit,t-poke,11/26/2021,1,Do you have full coverage insurance?  If you do call your insurance company and let them deal with it. They can go after the person who hit you if they‚Äôre found.  If you have liability only then you‚Äôre basically screwed. You‚Äôll have to pay out of pocket for a new car or repairs. **IF** the police find them you can sue but if they‚Äôre driving without insurance and running from accidents odds are they don‚Äôt have any money and are judgement proof.
hm7mq1v,lunlope,11/26/2021,1,401k with company match First.  IRA Second  HSA Third
hm7milt,thegreatgazoo,11/26/2021,1,But thats exactly what happened to a lot of people in 2008.   And interest rates are bound to go up. They have to. 3% mortgages and 7% inflation isnt sustainable. In 2007 I was making over 6% in a money market.
hm7621k,OneEyedWonderWiesel,11/26/2021,1,Company I work for has a bill pay system and it doesn‚Äôt debit the account until the check is cashed
hm745pr,anythingexceptbertha,11/26/2021,93,Not true with Bill Pay. They remove the funds from the account.
hm6s6wp,MountainStoneMist,11/26/2021,1,Yes all those expense ratios are on the low end including the DFA fund. The DFA expense ratio is higher than I prefer but not so much that it would prevent me from using it especially since I like having international exposure in my portfolios.
hm7d50m,Impressive_Aspect_52,11/26/2021,1,I wish I had $750 mortgage. I think 3 people can come up with that doing anything.
hm6wxol,personalfinanceta5,11/26/2021,1,Will keep an eye out on FB thanks :)  Thinking of buying new for couch/mattress then used for all wood furniture.
hm7uyrj,sicbot,11/26/2021,1,Look at the numbers:  4% = $2080 /y or $173.33 /m   6% = $3120 /y or $260 /m  Before tax its only $86.67 difference a month. I think your safe to take 6% if your going to do 4%.  If your struggling and living paycheck to paycheck it may be better to get your 3-6 month emergency fund ready before you contribute to your 401k. But that call is up to you. This really depends on were you live/ cost of living.  Contributing to your 401k as early as you can is really important. Its not about timing the market its about time in the market.  GLHF
hm82h1x,Hungry_Biscotti934,11/26/2021,1,How do you pick the dates you withdraw? Quarterly or do you try to pick high points in the year?
hm7rxpt,vettewiz,11/26/2021,1,That‚Äôs withholding. Not taxes actually paid.
hm81qlq,GreedyNovel,11/26/2021,1,3.25% is very low and keep in mind that inflation reduces the cost of your future payments so your true interest cost (right now at least) is likely negative.  So if there were ever a time to *not* pay early this is probably it. The question then becomes what do you do with the extra cash and thats an entirely different topic. But I wouldnt rush to pay down principal at any rate.
hm8dll1,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,1,I‚Äôve transferred everything from that account to another account that‚Äôs internal to that bank. Not sure if that helps or not but it makes me feel slightly better until I can get in contact with a branch manager regarding the situation.
hm8qhc0,Moreofyoulessofme,11/26/2021,34,It‚Äôs already in motion.
hm86s3m,polar_nopposite,11/26/2021,1,So... Like if he sold it for more than $50?  The entire premise of this post?
hm7lzk6,IJesusChrist,11/26/2021,1,I live and work in NYC. It is nearly impossible to afford something that would give us enough space.
hm7s59m,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,1,If youre referring to the section under Liability of the Cardmember know that this section is referring to Primary listed names.  As in Cardmember is not the same as Authorized User which is addressed in the next section.  In the Cardmember section when the plural is used it is referring to actual primary persons who are listed on the account.  As in for example Joint Cardmembers.  This is when 2 people (or more) are listed as Primary account holders and share all responsibilities.  This setup is rather rare in the cardholder industry.  But it does exist.  This is different from one Primary Cardmember and one Authorized User.  The Authorized User section spends a great deal of time explaining that the AU is not the responsible party for charges rather the Primary is solely responsible.
hm7f0j2,Mynam3snotRick,11/26/2021,1,Can you find a room on Craigslist? A roommate? What kind of apartments go for $1300/mo. If you desparately need to get out do it as cheaply (and safely) as possible. You can find some people who need to sublet rooms or are looking to rent a room in a home they own. Don‚Äôt get a $1300 apartment on your pay. You can get a second job but working 80hours to pay rent may affect your mental health more than living with a sick mom. Find a cheap place get out while keeping yourself safe and healthy
hm6tx15,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,0,Do you have GAP insurance? What is your coverage? What will your coverage pay for? How much if they deem it totaled? Get the answer to these questions and start there.
hm8idce,kepler1,11/26/2021,1,Is this bank employee like day 2 on the job?   How would anyone get to be an employee with that level of irresponsibility?     Either that or someone is impersonating him?  Report it right away.
hm7gfdf,sweadle,11/26/2021,1,If you cant find proof of the payment coming out of your account or the check cashed write them a new check.
hm8auar,chillbnb,11/26/2021,1,Yes Zelle payments are a valid way to pay rent.
hm7k5wd,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,Considering you cant put together a paragraph that would be considered passable in an office setting Id take this advice with a grain of salt.
hm73f3h,thetitswillwin,11/26/2021,2,Absolutely. Spent 6 years as a Chinook helicopter crew chief. Walked out the door at 27 with so many 6 figure job options a nice savings cool experiences not to mention VA home loans and a cute little disability check for the rest of my live even with Absolutely nothing wrong or injured
hm6zn88,93195,11/26/2021,5,If it hasn‚Äôt been cashed cancel the check and issue a new one.  Things get lost sometimes.  It happens.  That‚Äôs why you send a check not cash.
hm6y88p,joemetarei,11/26/2021,2,Yep that‚Äôs terrible advice. You‚Äôre literally missing out on free money. Not ‚Äúfree‚Äù money from the government ACTUAL free money.
hm6t9vf,Morhaleb,11/26/2021,45,I had this happen once but even talking to the direct supervisor didnt resolve it. What did was my refusing to come in to work. I told them you already got two weeks out of me so any money Im being paid for these two weeks is technically for the past two weeks so Im not working for free and will wait to come in until this is resolved.   Once they realized I was serious when I didnt show up and told them when they called that Id be in when I got paid for the past two weeks the money amazingly appeared in my account later that day.
hm8qh0y,pound-town,11/26/2021,1,People often fail to realize how good armed services pay is - imagine going in at 18 and working 20 years and retiring at 38. Like holy shit that‚Äôs good. Did you make a lot? Maybe not in dollar amounts but my armed services friends can literally spend every dime they make. I have to save for 30+ years of life after retirement and the insane cost of insurance after 55 and supplemental after 65. If I could turn back time I would be in the armed services in a second.
hm7pe3m,Inb4BanAgain,11/26/2021,1,I work with a lot of older people. One thing Ive noticed over the years is a lot of them retire and a few months later theyre lowered into the ground. If she doesnt have outside passions and activities that keep her going part time work (paid or volunteer) could be very healthy. Just kind of up to what her retirement dream looks like I suppose.
hm747ye,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,Technically you are violating the rules claiming exempt (it says something along the lines of you had no tax liability last year and or this year) but chances are they wont go after you.  I already started doing my taxes... Amazon had H&R block (w/o state) on sale for $18. Plugged in all my numbers and estimated the last 3 paystubs imported my investment gains/losses from Quicken and got a pretty good idea of what my tax liability is going to be.  Based on this info there would be absolutely nothing wrong in adjusting the credits on your W4 to get to $0 refund or even a small amount owed within the underpayment penalty safe harbor.  And yea it depends on how your HR processes it. Mine is online through ADP so it should take effect with no processing delay.
hm8r0ll,HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,11/26/2021,1,Look into VTSAX after you max out your IRA.
hm7eemh,merc08,11/26/2021,1,And they should be able to see what account cashed the check.
hm6wrkm,EvangelineRain,11/26/2021,2,I think the answer to your question ultimately depends on the purpose of the calculation.   Assets minus liabilities I think will generally include retirement and non-retirement accounts without regard to taxes and penalties that would have to be paid to liquidate them. But obviously that‚Äôs a limitation to the usefulness of that calculation.   I don‚Äôt know the answer to whether future alimony and child support payments would be considered a liability. I think it would be relevant to any sort of income calculation but my gut says it‚Äôs not a debt for net worth purposes generally speaking (any more than your future food bill is). Back child support/alimony owed would be a debt though. But I‚Äôm interested in what others have to say on that because if it were instead a judgment to be paid out in installments (equivalent to your child support order) then that would be a liability that would offset assets in a net worth computation.
hm6ttt8,MinutePianist4350,11/26/2021,2,I will just say out of all the times I‚Äôm familiar with a 529 being used to save money for children on social security it only became an issue once because the parents divorced (not a survivor situation) and there was a dispute over how the money should be held. That‚Äôs the only time I‚Äôm familiar with SSA ever taking anything close to an ‚Äúenforcement‚Äù action.   It probably won‚Äôt be a problem. Just know there‚Äôs a chance however remote that it could become one.
hm7n9cw,nynenynenyne,11/26/2021,1,Be careful removing yourself can also do harm since it may already be reporting. So it depends on the impact its currently making and after.
hm8kwzo,AtheistAgnostic,11/26/2021,1,Fairly certain that site also doesnt consider NYC taxes
hm8hgy4,ApatheticAbsurdist,11/26/2021,1,That site assumes No medical insurance. No dental/vision no long term disability no commuter plan deductions no FSA no HSA deductions.  It also depends on what you put on your W-2 in terms of allowances.  Also if youre weekly and at that salary youre more likely to be hourly. Confirm that your hours are in order. The first week may have been partial or if you didnt get paid time off for holiday youd be short on hours. Make sure your wages start at 1000 and then go line-by-line on your pay stub to see what is costing more than that calculator.
hm72cuz,curtludwig,11/26/2021,-1,Every union job Ive ever interviewed for would have resulted in less pay and worse benefits than I had already. Well you dont have any seniority.
hm7itlk,mmsj10,11/26/2021,1,Yes it is be go into the navy or if you are unsure join the reserves.  Once you get to boot camp you will see if it is a good fit for joining full time.  Also within the next four years you will most likely have a bunch of dead end jobs with joining the military full time you will get your housing paid for plus on the job trading with college $$ at the end.  You will also learn a great deal of personal discipline which will serve you well your entire life
hm849a2,Inb4BanAgain,11/26/2021,1,This ones got Dave Ramseys fingerprints all over it. Mathematically 1.5% is easy to beat but psychologically being debt free is hard to beat. Have been fully debt free including the home and gone back into debt because of this situation more or less. I like the stock I dumped the car cash into but seeing that payment go out every month makes me feel really stupid more often than not.
hm8ldr8,SkepticAquarian876,11/26/2021,1,REPORT THEM IMMEDIATELY!!. This is privacy violation and start monitoring your account activities to make sure not one penny was/is being taken out. Watch your social security number too.  Open another savings account at different bank and transfer all of it or just $100 in.  Dont forget to keep a copy for your records of that chat conversation.
hm73mfr,onions-make-me-cry,11/26/2021,1,Disagree - dont leave free money on the table.
hm7y8mt,vulcanjedi2814,11/26/2021,1,Not necessarily just disputing he could somewhat ‚Äòbacktrack‚Äô
hm8eafo,DeathKringle,11/26/2021,1,Your idea of indisputable proof does not help you if the landlord never got it and the check was cashed fraudulently.   &#x200B  Otherwise you could claim your paying him and never doing it and having someone else cash it etc.      basically you sending it and having proof of a check being cashed is not actually proof of paying rent.      All it is is proof that someone cashed a check stated for rent and if its cashed and signed it wont state it went into an account just cash so you dont know who got it. }     So even in your case it LEGITIMATELY could be you did not pay or sent it to the wrong person or it was intercepted etc.      The only proof if payment is a RENT RECEIPT from the landlord with him CONFIRMING you paid.      Then it wont matter if he cashes your check or not you have a receipt showing you paid and that would be non disputable proof far better than just a check cashed image.      now if the check was not cashed but deposited it is able to count as indisputable proof that you SENT the money to him. But simply cashed? man..... anyone can easily do that... relatively easily anyways.
hm8pj5o,HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,11/26/2021,2,Look into the cash envelope method to help get your spending under control. Pay down any high interest debt. If you struggle with using a credit card too much then literally cut it in half.  Save 3-6 months of expenses and once you have that emergency fund saved up look into VTI and Target Date Funds and decide which you like more. I‚Äôd also recommend looking into ibonds.
hm764f0,bb0110,11/26/2021,3,I agree with you that it‚Äôs a good investment I was just clarifying it is a guaranteed 50% return not 100%.
hm7ceie,OnlyPostSoUsersXray,11/26/2021,1,Yeah Im not so worried about it hurting me financially but rather my concern is making my taxes for this year more complicated.
hm8g259,123456478965413846,11/26/2021,1,Home owners are liable for taxes on capital gains.  When you sell a house you take the price you sold it for and the price you bought it for and file taxes on the difference.  But there are several rules specific to houses that let you reduce or eliminate that capital gain.  The most common two are that if you buy another house with the gains you dont have to pay taxes and if you lived there for 2 out of the last 5 years you can reduce the capital gain buy 250k per person or 500k per married couple.  But those exceptions to capital gains are specific to house and do not apply to other forms of capital gains.
hm797jc,UselessHumanNobody,11/26/2021,1,The military jobs you want from all branches:  Electricians mate engine man/mechanic aviation electronics tech/jet engine mechanic construction battalion Anything technology or intelligence like cryptography Information specialists etc  In the navy /Marine Corp‚Äôs network engineers ETs Radioman Sonar Tech usually come with a top security clearance that is highly sought after by govt contractors and you start with almost 6 figures! If you score above 75 on asvab you can take the nuke test which opens you up to more money opportunities in the service as well.   Find these jobs in the Army  they exist there too. You can come out making a ton of money and debt free.  When you‚Äôre in Boot Camp and getting started do everything in your power to avoid getting into loans because you‚Äôre probably going to get deployed. Take advantage of saving as much money as you can through the military credit unions and just hoard all your cash. Be frugal and it will go along way and you‚Äôll be in a great position for five years from now.
hm8to41,Statsbabe,11/26/2021,1,What everyone else said PLUS the teller has your address and SS#. If they feel free to contact you on Facebook they undoubtedly have other info about you as well. If you keep trying to give them the benefit of the doubt they may show up at your house and do far worse than ‚Äúask‚Äù for money.
hm6zwww,FindFIREsomeday,11/26/2021,0,Oh sorry.  My advice is based on my knowledge of the US system.  No idea if thats accurate for Canada.
hm7w3dz,Blah12821,11/26/2021,1,Don‚Äôt buy from California. You‚Äôll pay more for parts associated with emissions.
hm8hxxx,selfemployed0202,11/26/2021,1,Sorry no!  OP had the mindset that this wasnt right - what about the person who doesnt know or feels sorry for the person and gives them $?  We all know that OP is not the 1st nor the last person this teller has contacted.  It is worse than catfishing on dating or any other site.  If the teller wants to get married - hitting customers up for cash is a shitty way to figure out how to pay for that life.  If teller and SO cant afford a big wedding the court house is cheap and does the job.  Seriously this is the worst advice
hm6xg4a,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,To fall under the safe harbor you have to have 100% (110% of your prior year AGI was >=$150k) of your prior year tax liability withheld from your paychecks for the year. (not 90%) The 90% relates to your current year tax liability-- if you have at least 90% of your current years tax liability withheld from your paychecks you can also fall under the safe harbor.  In your case you will have to make sure to withhold at least enough to cover your tax liability from 2020-- to avoid the penalty.
hm8tvue,JDizzleNunyaBizzle,11/26/2021,11,I work in retail banking and this is not somebody you want working in retail banking. In fact we have mandatory training yearly that talks about never ever doing anything even remotely like this. You should talk to the branch manager.
hm7c7my,tuxed,11/26/2021,1,Not really. At the end of the year your provider will tell you how much you contributed for the year and if you made a traditional 401(k) contribution you can deduct that from your income.  But seeing as you probably won‚Äôt be contributing much to your 401(k) this year waiting out until January 1st is not going to hurt you.

I have money saved and tucked away to buy a house with when I find a good deal (I have 45% more saved than I need for my down payment). So what to do with random 2k?
hm8fr1t,Fondren_Richmond,11/26/2021,1,You are likely going to lose this battle with your landlord and should probably prepare to draft a second check then ask Chase to stop payment on the original one you sent. Earlier this fall my apartments management company changed about a week before the end of the month and informed us that the payment site that they require us to send all payments through as per the lease was immediately unavailable and advised us to set up payments with the new company. I set up bill pay in my bank to send rent checks to them which would arrive by the end of the month. The new rental company set up the new payment site a few days later but I emailed them advising I had already set up bill pay and had them  clarify that they would be able to credit my account once they received it. They said they would but of course they didnt claimed to have not seen the check until they called me back mid-month and asked me to pick it up and after I had already sent a second payment through the new system.
hm8ansu,cmockett,11/26/2021,1,I thought it wasn‚Äôt an asset?
hm7apyd,Aiorr,11/26/2021,-2,>Yes there is. Once the loan enters repayment you have a minimum payment either based on the payment plan you selected or the standard 10 year repayment plan.  I maybe wrong but dont you have to specifically sign up for repayment plan?  >I commented on your incorrect representation of how the loan would impact their credit score.  payment history makes large chunk of score but proportion is still a factor.  My FICO monthly report showed 50\~80 score tank out of blue back when I just started to pay student loan with message Proportion of loan balances to loan amounts is too high

hm8s3bj,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,True. Thats why I only corrected that part of your reply.   However to be completely accurate youd need to specify that you have to live in *and own* the house being sold for 2 of the previous 5 years to be eligible for the $250k/$500k capital gains exclusion.

hm8k2um,jaded_lady06,11/26/2021,1,I was in for 10 years and heres my thoughts:  If youre a woman dont do it. You will most likely experience a level of harassment and abuse that is insane.  If you cant take abuse i.e. being screamed at being told to do something by person one then asked to do another thing by person 2 start doing said task then being screamed at why you havent finished task 1 go to complete task 1 by person 1 then after going back to working on task 1 have person 2 come and scream at you threaten you with UCMJ and article 15 action for insubordination because task 2 isnt done yet...   If youre not a gym rat dont do it... I know since Ive gotten out the regs have changed but they will still run you through the ringer just for shits n giggles...  Theres a very long list of scholarships that you can apply to or start small with a local community college. If you do well (and if the college takes part in it) you should be invited to join PTK (Phi Theta Kappa). Its an honor society for outstanding students.   And if youre still insisting on joining the Army study the regs first and go in with knowledge. Theres actually a study guide that can be found online. Just Google us army study guide and itll give you the basics of basic training and such. If you cant tolerate heat much I suggest you do a winter/spring rotation in basic too.

hm6tj8o,boxsterguy,11/26/2021,3,> I had a similar situation with my daughter and any SS money not spent by the time she turned 18 had to be paid back.  You got a source on that?

hm6svkc,Blazemeister,11/26/2021,1,Okay so msrp plus dealer fees are the best you should reasonably expect especially if you‚Äôre getting one off the lot. And really the maverick starts at around $21500 as there‚Äôs a $1500 destination fee regardless of how you get it. Expect $500-$1000 in dealer fees and then state fees and taxes.   As someone with a Maverick on order really look at the base XL and see if that‚Äôs what you want. It‚Äôs relatively bare bones. Plus the hybrid is maxed out as far as ordering so unless you find one on a lot you‚Äôll need to order the ecoboost for an extra grand roughly. AWD is optional but if so that‚Äôs over $3000.   If you‚Äôre needing a vehicle today then best of luck.

hm7gpdg,DiscoIsntDead,11/26/2021,1,Typical rule of thumb is about 1 percent of house value annually. Some years it is more some less. When was your house built and what part of the country is it in?  In 14 years of home ownership over 3 properties typical maintenance includes: minor plumbing such as leaky toilets and faucets and clogged drains shingle repair HVAC maintenance and repair including replacement if aged system appliance repair exterior wood rot gutters exterior paint window seals or replacement tree trimming drainage doors out of square and needing replacement rotten exterior wood doors basement drainage issues.  Almost everything CAN be DIY as you learn save for roofing and complicated HVAC.
hm6tzpr,haggiebaby,11/26/2021,1,Thanks!  I kinda thought the money could be sheltered for 18 years. (\~8 years till they turn 18 plus 10 more).

I started late however as I didn‚Äôt save anything until 31 and didn‚Äôt really get serious about it until 38. I‚Äôm about to turn 41.

hm872he,slayer1am,11/26/2021,1,Everything hinges on how taxes apply to you and whether you should even worry about tax deferred investments.  I dont mess with percentages in my personal budget I just keep a rough average of a certain amount in checking and once it goes above that I skim off into the investment account.
hm7kz43,SuggestionDistinct51,11/26/2021,1,Like I said if buying vehicles that dont depreciate doesnt make sense to you I recommended you think about it.

I would investigate the title make sure there are no liens on the house taxes are paid etc.  If there are issues with deed and or taxes you can get free help with that depending on the city you live in.   \- Im hoping she can be put in a facility this will make it easier for you to deal with her house etc and decide what you want to do with it. Perhaps the house has some value and it can be fixed up and rented or sold to help with expenses.

hm6spg3,PetraLoseIt,11/26/2021,2,My hunch is that on average the return in the market (average 10%-ish) is going to be bigger than the mortgage interest rate (3.25%).   So personally I am paying the minimum on my mortgage and investing the rest.  But for you guys I could see you for example splitting the monthly surplus: $1k/month towards the mortgage and the rest towards investments.   That way you would still have solid progress on your mortgage while at the same time also benefitting from being in the stock market for a longer time period.

hm6vwge,Fubbalicious,11/26/2021,1,Youll have to talk to the bank and see if there is a way to unblock your account.  However as a cautionary tale this is exactly why I advocate to people to have accounts with at least two different banks--ideally with checking savings debit card and blank checks already setup.  And to have at least one month of expenses saved up at the backup bank.  This way if youre ever locked out or have your account hacked/bank account drained you still have money elsewhere to pay your bills in the meantime while you sort out the mess.  As for what to do do you have credit cards you can use to pay your bills in the meantime?  Otherwise you might need to ask friends/family for a loan to get you by.
hm6tasn,phryan,11/26/2021,1,It doesnt take much to fake an order number most places its sequential or otherwise easy to guess a valid order number.

hm8bcap,nerfherder998,11/26/2021,1,Everything he said but I still think you need to max out that match. Early withdraw from a 401k is a 10% penalty but that penalty applies only if you have a real emergency. If you can keep it in until the match vests you come out ahead anyway. I am not saying you should take early withdrawal lightly and get in the habit of treating 401k like a piggy bank.
hm8s3kn,dudevinnie,11/26/2021,1,27 joined when I was 18/19. Did my 4 went to school dropped out back in school. The Army was really the best decision I made. Best worst times of your life. Being paid to go to school is a huge stress relief and my experiences have really allowed me to grow as a person that I feel many people miss out on.  /e as for MOS I would do something 35 series linguist perhaps if you have an aptitude for it. You get paid extra scaling for language/fluency if I remember correctly. Can maximize your income since most likely joining as enlisted. On top of that youll most likely get a TS/SCI and you can leverage that when you return to the civilian world.   Id look into house hacking if you can take any college courses while youre active and use TA to cover it it will make a difference.

hm7rzid,fizzywater42,11/26/2021,1,The majority of bill pay checks from banks work like this. As soon as the check is generated the bank removes the funds from your account. I believe it‚Äôs because they often use 3rd party bill pay providers to send the check so they probably have the send the funds to the 3rd party bill pay company who is actually cutting the check and covering the payment when the check is cashed.

Also doesnt hurt to have a very good rate outside loan for e.g. my credit union does car loans for around 1.25% - 1.75% right now.  After that its just a math equation if youre giving up $1500 discount for 0% interest what is the cost of your 1.75% loan?

I didn‚Äôt have agenda except that I knew I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily always have those opportunities to save as much so went extreme.   I don‚Äôt think my oldest account went insane or anything. I‚Äôm 43 mostly single income crap raises.  SINK til recently and then her money doesn‚Äôt move needle much Have two littles now but still contribute much as I can to the things with lower maxes / matches.   I think I could have definitely retired early if stayed single I think kinda subconsciously used as retirement insurance. Retiring early was never agenda but just saved in case I needed to or wanted to. Certainly could have de stressed work and downsized job til full retirement age  Right now with the kids and wife large age gap trying to survive thru HS and then be done. My boss thinks I could coast now and I said he‚Äôs crazy with wife age gap and two kids pre a kindergarten at 43  The longer in and you don‚Äôt mess with it and get in your own way the better.  You can always dial back. But can‚Äôt always save more when u want to.   I just hit $1M.
hm6xrkm,merc08,11/26/2021,2,Maybe.  Or they havent fixed the issue and the next paycheck will be a problem too.
hm6yx8t,thehawkman22,11/26/2021,2,You are correct. It‚Äôs a common misconception that contractors have to pay for clearances. Companies do not have to pay to get people cleared.
hm8raia,diatho,11/26/2021,2,If you can open the Roth now do it. Fund it asap.   For 22 you will need to do a backdoor Roth. When doing this you pay taxes on gains so ideally you want $0 in your traditional IRA.
hm8qkvo,BG_1952,11/26/2021,14,Go into the bank on Monday--dont do this over the phone.  Take time off from work if you have to.  Ask to speak to a bank manager about a confidential matter.  Do not provide details until you know you are speaking to someone in authority.  Give them the details.  A person so desperate to ask a customer for money could take the next step and do something worse.  Dont be persuaded by others asking you to have pity.  The whole thing could be a con or it could be worse.
hm77yk4,debtlady,11/26/2021,1,I appreciate the detailed response.   If my earnings are better and Im not being hounded by a debt collector I think I can live with not being eligible for an auto loan or a mortgage and I can survive with just a debit card.  I guess what concerns me most is being able to rent an apartment with poor credit.   Do you happen to know what issues I might come up against in this regard and how they may be overcome?
hm6tlt2,IcyChampionship3067,11/26/2021,1,Absolutely! Mine were just examples of the not so obvious ones. The thing about construction based jobs ya cant outsource them and theyre money in the bank when you own your home. Trust me. Married to a general building contractor parent of a former army intl soldier working in the private sector now AFB brat of a lifer who served in WWII Korea and Vietnam. I also served back in the dark ages of USAF.
hm8tido,Sun1Moon9,11/26/2021,1,Inform the bank officially just in case ......    Which bank is this BTW?
hm737jk,unchinhairs,11/26/2021,1,Have you looked in any local housing groups? With rent being $2500 for presumably a 1 bedroom (your post doesnt specify) there have got to be plenty of students and young professionals who find less expensive housing by rooming together and are around your age. By looking in those groups you might find more flexible housing options than renting an entire apartment for yourself. Maybe youd like a furnished space so that you dont have to buy additional furniture. Maybe youd be cool with a small room thats really a den not a bedroom because you just need a place to sleep during the week. It may take some digging but a few days of searching is certainly worth saving thousands of dollars over the course of a year.  Similarly maybe you can rent your house. If youre coming back every weekend then obviously the tenant would need to be fine with that. But maybe you have a friend who is responsible and wouldnt mind your company.  Also I am assuming moving will not impact your job but if it does that is also something to consider.
hm7vp53,Tyrthalae,11/26/2021,1,I use Chase Bill Pay for a lot of things. In many cases (if recipient can‚Äôt be paid electronically) they cut a paper cheque and mail it but still withdraw funds immediately from your account. This is different than many other banks but is actually something I like personally. Also explains the confusion from many who don‚Äôt bank with Chase since Chase bills are paid from a segregated (bank operated) account. They make a few pennies per bill in keeping those funds segregated for hours/days. Or more / longer in your case!  Now: if the cheque was cashed you‚Äôd be able to see the image in online banking. I know this because I do it all the time (eg my monthly HOA fee is a paper cheque Chase cuts. I see the deposit image when it‚Äôs cashed.)  If Chase says it wasn‚Äôt cashed they should be able to stop payment it and you‚Äôll get your money back. If they can‚Äôt stop payment it means it was cashed and they can figure out who cashed it - becomes a potential fraud case since landlord says he didn‚Äôt cash it so someone did ‚Ä¶   Do that stop payment and then pay your landlord again (perhaps an in person cheque this one time to avoid hassle). If they‚Äôre willing to waive late fees after negotiating great but otherwise you may have a claim with Chase for the late fees I‚Äôm not sure how much traction you‚Äôll get there but generally Chase will play ball on that if your landlord is willing to state to them that he didn‚Äôt get the cheque.  My 2.5 cents for what it‚Äôs worth.
hm7iov7,LZ_OtHaFA,11/26/2021,1,tell me what to put fwiw I make $120k gross and I am paid 24 times per year with 2 more checks this year.
hm6s7aj,thaddeus_crane,11/26/2021,2,I would keep the dog if you can afford it (in both time and expense -- puppies are resource-intensive). I saw youre trying to coastFIRE -- it sounds like you have different values and approaches to finances and this debt would hinder you from your financial goals at best and drag you down at worst (especially if you get married). I wont comment too much on the relationship as its for another sub but 6 months in is *very* fast to move in together get a dog and then try to fix a mans expenses for him.
hm8kz2b,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,So the payments would all just bounce and youd get charged return item fees by the companies youre paying. This doesnt sound like a better solution.
hm7dqcr,UnquestionableBadger,11/26/2021,1,Congrats youre on the hook! Adult care centers can force you to pay for your mothers living expenses and can sue for non payment
hm7gcrp,neverfucks,11/26/2021,1,Sure but every financial strategy has some risk associated with it. Holding 20k in cash exposes you to some type of black swan severe inflation event risk for example on top of the known opportunity cost of not investing it. In the case of using a HELOC as an e-fund youre making the reasonably low risk bet that an emergency may occur or your HELOC may get closed on you but they very likely will not both happen at the same time.
hm7wcni,i4k20z3,11/26/2021,1,how much do you put in each?
hm860u6,Kilren,11/26/2021,1,But were not use to having competent managers in healthcare...  When I encounter one it takes me a few months to believe that its not a good cover or a bluff
hm7726e,SkepticAquarian876,11/26/2021,-2,IMO.The bank already have picture proof that you did your part by having auto payment sent up and sent for your rent.  Him having no record of this tranactions is not your problem. It is his own shotty book keeping and he should rectify his own records.  He prolly spent that money quick and fast in 2020 and forgot to record it in his ledger.  How has he retrieve all the other rent payments this far?
hm7yhcm,ciderenthusiast,11/26/2021,1,If it were me Id not contribute anything at all to retirement until I had a larger emergency fund such as $5000.  Then contribute to get the match.  Just be sure you actually save the money not spend it and delay retirement contributions.  Hopefully it will only take a few months to save the \~ $3500 which is just a blip long term and wont actually lose you too much in employer match.  Having cash savings also really helps peace of mind.  Then my next step would depend on your job stability and student loan payment interest rate.  If you have family to fall back upon for financial help and the student loan interest rate is low (< 4% ish) Id focus on the retirement fund as compounding interest will make that money work better for you long term than paying off the student loans early.  If you cant or wont fall back upon your parents building a healthy emergency fund (3-9 months expenses) before paying off debt and/or bumping up your retirement contribution is a good idea.  And $52k at 24 is good congrats!
hm80oyw,zhonzhon,11/26/2021,1,if you have uninsured drivers coverage you can file a claim with your insurance.  or it might be covered under your collision policy as well.
hm7bli4,assbanger3000,11/26/2021,1,Yea but doesnt that incur penalties? I think what matters most here is how comfortable he would feel with those risks. I am one to not like those odds and prefer to have cash handy for emergencies. Everything else is invested.
hm8mua0,CyberSecurityGuy1,11/26/2021,1,True. Unless you go with the 1 time fee.
hm8eyrd,peachykeen_xlh,11/26/2021,1,Ive heard of people taking lawyers with them when they sign thier enlistment contract. Either youll scare the absolute shit out of the recruiter or he wont even try and screw you. Things have changed a lot in the 12 years for me but it may be worth it. 4-6 years isnt that long but it is when you hate it.
hm8fb43,93195,11/26/2021,1,It may not go up a ton if she has a great driving record.  As you said the car counts more than the driver.  But the driver counts too.  It certainly won‚Äôt go down and almost certainly will go up at least some.  Remember the driver coverage won‚Äôt just be for OP‚Äôs car it wil be for any car the covered driver uses including rentals.  TLDR it will go up.  Maybe not a ton.  But up.
hm746ep,missha515,11/26/2021,4,Can you get roommates to lower rental costs and still be close to your job and gym?
hm853yj,vynm2,11/26/2021,1,This isnt the question you asked but something to be aware of youre making state estimated tax payments...  If you itemize your deductions then the date you make your state estimated tax payment DOES matter. You can only deduct the state tax payments that were actually paid in 2021 on your 2021 tax return. So if you make your 4Q state ES payment on or before Dec 31 2021 then you can take it as an itemized deduction in 2021. If you pay it Jan 1-15 2022 it would be an itemized deduction in 2022.
hm77o9l,N0X3D,11/26/2021,1,Thank you for the clarification.  More research required!
hm8bb8c,ParryLimeade,11/26/2021,1,Had this issue with CapitalOne as well. None are safe and I refuse to use this feature anymore. At least if I send a physical check the image of the check is uploaded into my account when it‚Äôs cashed.
hm87r60,peacefulhectarez,11/26/2021,1,On one hand at the interest rates checking accounts tend to pay (0.05-0.1%) over the course of a few days thats not even a penny unless the check is pretty large so it still doesnt seem worth it.  On the other hand Ive seen Office Space.
hm7yuf3,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,Auto enthusiast here. What kind of speed are we talking about? 10mph or so? Make/model/year?  Financially it probably doesnt make sense to take any action IMO. Is the taillight damage repairable or is the actual housing cracked?  Structural damage is unlikely unless it was a bit more significant. If your bumped is completely off-kilter (look at it during the day time) then it may have been enough force to engage the bumper support but I honestly wouldnt overthink it.
hm887ga,Fishtale1,11/26/2021,1,Thanks! Any idea how much I should expect to spend on the inspection and roughly how long itll take?
hm7fyie,HiddenLeafPervySage,11/26/2021,1,I would say go for it but I would tell you to go to the Air Force. I‚Äôm in the Army and only joined cause I was ‚Äútoo fat‚Äù for the Air Force but the Army let me pick my exact job. I worked in a really hot field in the IT industry and I‚Äôm using the Army as a stepping stone to a 6 figure salary. You‚Äôre still young so you‚Äôd get out at 23 and be very well off if you save and pick a good MOS so if you do go for it do your research!!! Recruiters will literally try to sell you anything
hm8s9rg,ZenGuruji,11/26/2021,1,The 50/30/20 rule is for people who find comfort in seeing balance.   The better approach to is to view your investments and long-term savings amounts as another bill and pay yourself off. Then use the remainder on yourself.
hm8rufa,300zxTTFairlady,11/26/2021,3,Yeah totally understand but hopefully it keeps him at bay. Good luck with everything. You might have saved someone in the future with getting scammed. Hes definitely done this before and gotten away with it. Dude must walk around with a wheel barrow to carry around his massive balls.
hm8cbgt,Impossible-3006,11/26/2021,1,Maybe contact your financial institution. Who knows how many people this teller has tried this on.
hm6vc44,jaejaeok,11/26/2021,1,No idea. Every bank is different and I haven‚Äôt heard of this one. Side consideration: always go through the bank when you‚Äôre considering making a large purchase or transfer to avoid this in the future. Anytime I do something over $2K I call first or ask them to wire.
hm6x1dj,kaijubooper,11/26/2021,1,I have a similar situation with my mom although she hasnt had a medical issue where she needed to be hospitalized recently. Please make sure you are taking care of yourself and setting boundaries about what you can and cannot do. Do not agree to take care of her at home after discharge from the hospital if you are not willing / able to be her caretaker.  Talk to the hospital social worker. There are more resources out there besides your moms assets - it sounds like she will qualify for Medicaid if she has less than $2k in assets. The value of her home shouldnt count towards that if shes over resources there has to be a spend-down but paying some medical bills should help with that. Medicaid will pay for assisted living and since shes in the hospital they should help expedite a placement into assisted living.   Medicaid can also help pay for some medical debt I believe if it was incurred in the last three months. The hospital should have financial assistance available for any bills not covered by Medicaid.  I spent months trying to get help for my mom after my dad passed away and the advice I heard from several people including a lawyer is that its easier to get help for an elderly parent if they are in the hospital vs if they are at home. The state my mom lives in basically wont do anything as long as shes not clearly mentally incapacitated even though she pees and shits in her clothes and on the floor and has to call the EMTs every time she falls.  I finally had to leave my mom on her own because I couldnt take it anymore. I couldnt get her approved for in-home help through Medicaid and she wouldnt agree to pay for private in-home care. My mom is not wealthy by any means but is a few hundred dollars over the $2k resource limit and I cant get her to spend it down. I dont have POA so I cant do anything about that. Im just waiting for her to be hospitalized or worse and Im really fucking pissed that my only options are to sacrifice my life or wait until she has a medical emergency.  I dont have enough money to pay for in-home care am an only child and felt immense pressure to make sure my mom was taken care of even though my mental health suffered a lot. I do think I did everything I could to get help for her but had to finally leave to take care of myself but Im still really angry and upset about this situation and that theres little support for families going through this when the elderly parent is being unrealistic and uncooperative.
hm6xvby,93195,11/26/2021,2,That‚Äôs usually the insurance conpany‚Äôs call not yours.  But if it‚Äôs close enough where they ask what you want yes I‚Äôd take the check assuming I agreed with the amount they were offering.
hm6w5p3,Kortze26,11/26/2021,1,I think the type of people that down voted are Starbucks employees with $140k+ student loan debt with annual income around $25k/year.
hm8rzru,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,2,The primary factor to consider when getting an auto loan is to get the vehicle you need with the monthly payment you can afford comfortably. Credit score should never be a deciding factor.
hm70yy7,utkrowaway,11/26/2021,1,Most FAs people encounter are just salesmen for the brokers managed funds. Call up Merrill Lynch et. al. ask to speak to a financial advisor and thats what youre going to get.
hm7azn6,bkdlays,11/26/2021,2,The burden is on you to prove it was paid.  Your bank sucks if they cant say if the check was chased.  The landlord probably didnt get the check.  You will need to re-issue that check.  I suspect eventually chase will reconcile the missing check and the money will come back into your account.  &#x200B  These are some of the issues with billpay.
hm82r4k,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,> Its only going to get easier when we combine finances and share one YNAB account after we get married haha  Thats the way to do it. If you can get aligned on finances now youll be in a much better position once everything is combined.  In my case I oversee all of our finances but we hold a monthly budget update so shes aware of where everything is. At this point I know our exact financial picture within 1-2% at anytime. Its great. Nothing wrong with being clear and transparent on finances.
hm748nn,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,5,The artist should also get an EIN in addition to getting a DBA or LLC so that they dont have to provide their personal SSN to payers.  DBA is still a matter of public records though.
hm76jrv,lilmoonboi,11/26/2021,2,Completely fine if your credit score is still ok. Depending on if it‚Äôs a du or lp loan they will use 1% or .5% as estimated  monthly payment.
hm80b9i,68_Bullitt,11/26/2021,1,Got it!  Damn Im particular to the max but you guys have everything broken down so specifically. Definitely your engineer side. When those estimates no longer hold true dont take it personally--it happens to all of us. Especially once your introduce a home family etc.  In short those numbers look good. That definitely explains it!
hm832mm,borkthegee,11/26/2021,1,This isnt true at all you can wire money all day long in America just like the EU  The reality is that checks are free and nearly every other option is 1-3%
hm8mrpn,ThisIsAMonere,11/26/2021,1,It sounds like this ‚Äúrule‚Äù doesn‚Äôt apply to you then.  This rule is designed for people who tend to overspend on ‚Äúpersonal spending.‚Äù It helps them try to keep their ‚Äúpersonal spending‚Äù down to 30%.  You clearly need way way less than 50% for your general needs so you should budget it such a way that ignores this 50/30/20 rule and instead prioritizes investing and saving for goals instead.
hm7v5r8,King-Juggernaut,11/26/2021,1,Agree with this. I wish I had financial sense before starting my 5 year contract. I also allowed my recruiter to straight up lie to me out of my Intel contract. DO NOT trust your recruiter. Other than that I would reccomend any young person without a clear direction strongly consider the military. Im definitely set up well because of it.
hm6tib8,BouncyEgg,11/26/2021,4,Disclosing your country may better narrow your legal guidance.

hm75l4t,bb0110,11/26/2021,5,It‚Äôs 50% match though. You put in 100 they put in 50.
hm6wwqu,Mishapchap,11/26/2021,1,Never let more than 2 months of social security income sit in the account. That‚Äôs when they can garnish it. Based on what you are saying that wouldn‚Äôt happen but just make sure that the account the SS flows into has an outflow of the SS payment every month.   An old person I mines was in the same situation and this is what a nonprofit elder law firm advised me. So If they get  $1000 in SS income make sure to withdraw $1000 from the account that month.   The person I know stopped making minimum payments on the card (they had gotten very high) and other than phone calls and letters from collectors nothing happened. It‚Äôs been 3 years now. Edited to add‚Äî these people had no assets.
hm764ho,DeluxeXL,11/26/2021,1,> I am investing 20% into 401k  > I am adding $10k minimum to Roth (Fidelity)  Is this $10k a part of your 20% to 401k or a combination of Roth 401k and Roth IRA?  > College for an 8 yr and 2 day old some sort of fund to give to the kids when they turn 21  529 or UTMA. You can invest them.
hm6xlia,colty31,11/26/2021,1,Before the accident. So using KBB should give a rough estimate. Maybe they will factor in the current used car market not 100% sure on that.
hm74t64,HistoricalBridge7,11/26/2021,3,We need a tiny bit more information. What‚Äôs the interest rate in your student loans and other debt if you have it? If it‚Äôs high say 5% or more it might not be a terrible idea to buy the debt down. In general it‚Äôs always a good idea to max out the 401K up to the company match or as much as you can. It doesn‚Äôt make sense if you‚Äôre saving zero money after maxing out.

hm85o0k,SwordfishTough,11/26/2021,1,$5-15k is a big range but even the higher end is totally reasonable given your income.   In making purchases I would decide ahead of time whether its a short-term or long-term piece and spend accordingly. E.g. if your apartment only fits a 4 person dining table but you want to have at least an 8 person dining room when you buy a house dont splurge on the table. But if your bedroom has space for a king bed and you see yourself needing that long term spend more on the bed.  Start small and build up over time once you figure out what youll actually end up using.
hm8qw6w,Real_Working,11/26/2021,1,Not sure how much funds you have to transfer but if isnt much you could always do it via Zelle for free.  Otherwise there is always EFT but there may be some costly fees if you have a lot to transfer.
hm89npv,Garet44,11/26/2021,1,I regret not joining the Air Force you should look into that option and see if you can make it work or if youd even be interested. The Army will not live up to your expectations (at least it didnt to mine). This is a huge organization and lets just say the smartest people get out after one or maybe 2 contracts. The leadership is not that great and youll constantly find yourself in pretty lousy situations and regularly leave your comfort zone. Please dont fool yourself into thinking this profession is without sacrifices mental and physical. It beats being homeless in prison or being dead though not that Ive been the last one but Ive been close enough. The Army can be a good foundation for the rest of your life no doubt about that. Youll learn valuable skills learn a lot about yourself and there are plenty of programs to make the Army work for you if you can network while youre in. As for finding something worth putting your time into the Army wont help much with that while youre in. There are times when youll be busy and there are times when all you do is wait but it never seems that youre being very productive. Its always training that no one really takes seriously enough or running around like a chicken with its head cut off doing seemingly arbitrary tasks. Oh and lots of details. When you get higher rank it just gets even more stressful.
hm8in9h,jthomas287,11/26/2021,1,I am a bank manager.   Tell someone. They 100% have access to your accounts and should not be working with peoples money. This is a huge breach of trust. This employee should be fired and black listed for this.
hm8exno,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,If trading it in / selling it dont do the repairs.  Sell as is.
hm7t4yy,Rear_ended_old_car,11/26/2021,1,Yeah its probably worth between $2-3k. The only reason Im hesitant is because the taillight still isnt working with me changing the bulb and the fact that there may be some structural damage that Im not seeing. If it was just the cosmetics I wouldnt care.
hm7wtjv,ShowMeTheTrees,11/26/2021,1,I use Chase and Billpay.  Im always able to click proof of payment and print out the image of the front and back.  Id print out your statements from that month and every month since that time.  You can show your landlord:  * The check that was issued * That the funds were debited from your account when they mailed payment.  That should prove that you made every attempt to pay normally.  Ask Chase to refund you and then repay.  Side note - will your landlord take Zelle through Chase? I pay everybody possible that way.
hm8omu4,NVPcMan,11/26/2021,1,Wells Fargo is notorious for this.    If you are paycheck to paycheck the best advice I can recommend is pay everything with a credit card that you can and change the due dates or payment dates for everything you cant to 4-5 days after your payday.  The overdraft fees really eat into savings and when times are tough thats good taken out of the cupboard.  If you call customer service they might reverse some of them if this isnt a regularly occuring issue.
hm891jd,whiskytangofoxtrot12,11/26/2021,1,The original account would need to be a Roth so more than likely no it cannot be rolled into an inherited Roth. And yes the money can be sheltered for 18 years because they fall under the minor rule.

hm7pcf8,RealMccoy13x,11/26/2021,1,It can be but you need to understand why. The CFPB doesnt care about your story. They only care about what subsections were violated. If you give them a nasty yelp review they will close your complaint in most cases. The exception is if the bank decides they do not want to invest the time to review the complaint and just award you the loss amount. I recommend you focus in on what you believe you were wronged about because they normally wont let you file twice on the same issue. Sometimes there are some technicalities for an easy win but sometimes you are outright liable and even they will let you know it.
hm6ujfm,SuckaPunchSpliff,11/26/2021,1,Student loans. I‚Äôve been waiting for the forbearance to be over to pay them off. How much should I save for a down payment?

hm8lo2i,I_Will_Not_Be_Cancel,11/26/2021,1,Then his parents company is technically committing tax fraud.
hm7zlhx,myassholealt,11/26/2021,1,Not for chase. Chase takes the money out as soon as you submit payment. Then they cut a physical check and mail it out and its up to the usps to get it to the recipient. Ive had many checks lost in the wild and had to call and request stop payment and resend payment.
hm786aw,pbrew,11/26/2021,1,Establish early the habit to save. Maximizing 401K is one of the first steps. Major tax advantage. And matching is free money.  Even if it leaves less for you  it sets you up and prevents life style creep.
hm7oypa,Ok-Meringue7413,11/26/2021,1,Around 30% of gross income is removed for taxes/401k/health insurance/HSA. For example my last check was $1700 from my full time job and $400 was removed for just taxes then an additional $130 for 401k/HSA/Medical.
hm82tcw,gregallen1989,11/26/2021,1,You should still be able to grow your savings while matching the 6%. If not make sure your budget is tight. If you still cant then sure you might want to bump up your savings a little but at 24 that extra 2 percent in your 401k is HUGE and you want to do it if at all possible
hm7ci6d,iheartnjdevils,11/26/2021,1,It looks like Chase withdraws the funds and sends what is basically a cashier‚Äôs check to the recipient. So it‚Äôs not an ACH transaction but they still should be able to check if it was cashed or not.

hm6sfbi,inkheart58,11/26/2021,3,I would personally avoid investing in crypto. It can have high returns but it is extremely volatile and is damaging the environment something your kids will see the effect of more than you. With that in mind there are many ESG funds popping up which I believe will see huge growth over the next 10 years given the pandemic and climate crisis. Id suggest looking at investing that $300pm into one of these or at least something more diverse than the 4-6 cryptos.  Also have you considered whether you need a car? If you do have you considered an electric vehicle and home charging infrastructure? This has an up-front cost but may significantly save on gas by the time your kids reach the intended ages for summer camp.

hm6wfol,rowrowrowurbutt,11/26/2021,1,Thank you thats a good idea to check out!  Mom had no will no probate. She gave me some verbal instructions before she passed but it was more about her funeral than anything financial. Ive never dealt with a death in the family before so...honestly Im not really sure what Im doing but Im too afraid of a big attorney fee to try and hire one.  Her car was paid off. I closed all of her credit accounts and stopped any recurring donations. She had a mortgage but Ive just continued paying it since Ive been living abroad and didnt want to stir any difficult situations up when I wouldnt be stateside to handle them. Now that Im back in the US my next step will be contacting the mortgage company. I also recently learned I need to send her death certificate to Social Security Id thought the cremation service did so already. Its been quite a learning curve!
hm8iocw,cballowe,11/26/2021,1,I suspect if you phrase it that way you get answers that people would prefer to bounce Netflix so banks order it that way ...

hm85thu,ciaobella88,11/26/2021,1,Oopf Im an RN and this has happened to me at two of my jobs recently. I had to co tact payroll and both companies ended up issuing me a paper check. Such a hassle but yeah I had to be persistent.
hm7q02z,Dopeshow4,11/26/2021,1,Yeah sounds like someone is being entitled when they just need to get any form of income to keep a house.
hm8pyxx,Sarkir,11/26/2021,2,Tellers/scammers cant really do much with account numbers except deposit money into accounts without raising any red flags. In other areas of the world account numbers are more widely shared since people cant really use them for much. Routing numbers are even generalized to states and regions. You would need a debit card and/or credit card to really do damage to someones account and usually people set up PINs on them to prevent unauthorized use. Bank tellers bankers and other bank staff do not have access to PINs or have a way to access them either. Usually the most they can do is change them with proper authorization from customers.  I would not worry about being ruined by this teller but I would definitely report their behavior. It is completely inacceptable behavior and huge breach in privacy and ethics.
hm7937u,ahj3939,11/26/2021,1,Loyalty rate isnt really a think unless they have some program that says you get 0.15% discount if you keep checking with direct deposit or something like that.

hm7ho9v,addicuss,11/26/2021,1,Auto pay is weird. It sends a physical check in these instances and they can get lost. It debits your account first. Then months later the bank will automatically void the check and youll get your money back.

Does it seem like he is trying to progress the conversation in a way that puts pressure on you? Does the facebook profile have a very low number of friends and little to no info? If you try to look up the teller via a facebook search does the same profile pop up?  There‚Äôs a very good chance that a scammer created a fake profile that looks like this bank teller and is using it to contact random people to get them to send money either via cryptocurrency cashapp or friends and family paypal. The above red flags are things that are dead giveaways.
hm8lpne,RotaryEnginePhone,11/26/2021,1,Looks like youll need to make up for about $400 a month... definitely check out r/mintmobile right now. They have a 3 free months deal right now and if you could survive on their cheapest option that would be $135/yr for phone service. They also allow using the phone as a hotspot so depending on the service in your area it could replace the internet for basic needs.  Definitely take advantage of everything available to you. Food banks child tax credit. Find as many resources as possible before taking the second job. This is my opinion of course but I think this will help you be more likely to succeed with school. Ask your school for any resources available through student services.  Not sure of your kids ages but look into anything possible. Boys and Girls Club Head Start pre-k programs. See if your kids qualify for CHIP. ([https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/childrens-health-insurance-program/](https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/childrens-health-insurance-program/))   Best of luck!

hm8j1bi,trmoore87,11/26/2021,1,Got it. So I‚Äôm in a similar situation to OP. should I contribute $6k annually to my 401k after tax and do an annual rollover to a Roth IRA? Would this effectively be the same as having a direct $6k contribution? And my wife could also do the same thing.   Also do 401k contributions reduce MAGI? Our annual base is around $225k. We are just on the edge of the cutoff.
hm7dhag,tobesteve,11/26/2021,1,Yes I now can see that an answer would be complicated and it really depends on why Im looking for it. And Im looking for it at least for two reasons one is to compare how Im doing relative to an average person so I can compare when they say someone my age/income on average has this worth. Yet another reason is if I lose my job could I cash in retirement and still have anything left after paying off those things and how much.

Both incomes I estimate will be $180000 over 4 years time before any expenses taxes and/or saving. The electrician thing will take me 5-6 years and if I were to start putting money away itd be $40-50/week.

hmavf4o,Duplicitous2,11/27/2021,1,Banks ask questions like this all the time as part of their AML controls program its very standard and ever federally regulated bank is required to collect data on potentially suspicious activity.  The amount of money physically in one branch has nothing to do with total cash reserves. Its not like in the movies where a bank branch has millions of dollars in a vault the assess their cash needs and order what they think they will need plus a small buffer. I worked for a top 5 bank at a suburban branch and we never had more than probably 300k in the building at any one time.  If you want to keep your money in a mattress go ahead but this is how banking works.

hmbmik0,formerprincess,11/27/2021,1,Have you seen your actual insurance bill? Or are you paying your father $250 because he told you that was the cost?  The rate for your share should be itemized on the bill.   When you know that amount you can get quotes from other companies to see if it is reasonable.  You will probably pay more to be on your own policy. However if the other cars on your fathers policy are flashy you could be paying too much.
hmbjev6,UGA10,11/27/2021,1,1.  $65000 is a lot. Nothing wrong with putting some in a brokerage account.  Just make sure you have a 6 month emergency fund NOT in the market.   2.  A Roth IRA is a good option but you would need to do backdoor roth contributions.  Do you have any pre-tax money in a Traditional IRA currently?  If so you will run into the pro rata rule.   3.  1.8% is low enough that you are most likely better off investing money over paying extra towards the loans. That said nobody will fault you for trying to get out of debt faster.
hmbleiv,stupes100,11/27/2021,1,I would consider paying it off but not because of the near term direction of the market. Don‚Äôt ever operate out of fear or greed. You might regret your decision. I would pay it off because it is financially wise.

hmbo5pu,jbchris3,11/27/2021,1,call the finance company  immediately.  the last thing they want to do is repossession. they want you to keep making payments. a similar situation  happened to me and I was able to work out a 2 month grace period. they just threw the missed payments to the end of the loan.

hmbm7pm,UGA10,11/27/2021,1,1.  Im in the same boat but not that much spending. I just count my necessity money needed each month. What I would need if we both lost our jobs.  2.  Yes. A Roth IRA will grow tax free and is tax free on withdrawal in retirement.  You can only put in $6000 per year per person though so you will still have a brokerage after that.  Also Congress is trying to do away with the backdoor roth so keep an eye on that.    3.  Id probably lean towards getting out of debt too so you arent alone in that mindset.

Just due to both banks being absorbed by PNC and I must say their app/website are the biggest pieces of shit Ive ever had to use.  Im not even going to rant about all the problems Ill just focus on the main one...I OFTEN TIMES AM NOT SURE OF HOW MUCH MONEY IS EVEN IN MY ACCOUNT DUE TO THE WEBSITE BUGGING OUT OR IT JUST LISTING AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THATS TOTALLY INCORRECT. Sometimes it shows me having more money than I should so I have to be careful others it shows me as having much less than I should so I have to be even more careful. Never had this issue with BoFA Chase or Simple. They were always clear about charges/pending charges and I never had to bust out a calculator trying to figure out how much spending money I have.
hmbmlqj,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1,No it really wont matter. At this point just open credit cards for bonuses or better rewards. Actually for a mortgage in the near future since presumably at 19 your credit history is not very long you should avoid opening any more new accounts.  If you have an existing Amex card you can ask them to double or triple your credit limit. They will not do hard pull. Also see if any of your other cards do increasess without hard pulls: https://www.doctorofcredit.com/credit-cards/which-credit-card-companies-do-a-hard-pull-for-a-credit-limit-increase/  Also keep in mind your *reported* credit card balance can have a large impact on your credit scores and mortgages use older FICO versions that are even more sensetive. For the best possible scores you want one card to report a small balance say $5 and the rest $0.

hmb3718,Its-a-write-off,11/27/2021,1,Depreciation recapture is likely the biggest tax hot theyll take here so it matters. They have probably reduced their basis to just a million or so by now.  Any chance theyll be doing a 1031 exchange?  They pay capital gains on just the profit.  But they pay depreciation recapture on the difference between their basis and 3.5 million and that at their marginal tax rate. So probably 37% just for federal.

There are some savings to be had... cohabitating saves money. Depending on what you have for health insurance if one spouse has better health benefits at work that could lead to savings. There can be some tax benefits filing married but its not really as big as many people make out.  But if you have a very expensive wedding that can lead to a lot of debt. And if you mix your finances and the other partner is bad with money... their debt is your debt.  Cohabitate live together without mixing finances and see how it goes. Get to know the inner workings of the other person. Many marriages fail because of incompatible financial attitudes and living together will give you better insight into that. Hopefully everything is great and then you can tie the knot. But I will tell you one thing that is very expensive is divorce.  One other thing Ive learned about relationships (as Im at least twice your age) Ive been with my partner for more than half of your entire life span and it will sound weird but part of the reason we feel we last is that we both are capable of walking away from the relationship. Not that we want to but if we did we wouldnt be here. We know both of us are here because we want to be not because we need to be. If one person is I cant live without you (either emotionally financially or for whatever reason) the relationship becomes imbalanced and that isnt healthy. Having some financial stability to the point where if he wasnt there you could on some level support yourself (even if its painful) helps keep that balance in check.
hmbmeur,burn-my-dread,11/27/2021,1,That isnt a great reason to leave. I would take the counter offer in your position.

hmbiqaz,Wahoo2K8,11/27/2021,1,Insurance won‚Äôt pay for fees while their investing still is ongoing.  OP has the responsibility to mitigate damages and excessive tow fees can absolutely be deducted from the settlement amount.  And finally if they don‚Äôt accept liability OP will be responsible for fees anyway so of course he or she has the incentive to minimize fees.

hmbph7s,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,$250 is not unlikely for a young driver. Thats not to say you/your dad shouldnt shop around though.   The value of your car is not really *that* important. Medical liability you cause from hurting someone in an accident is much higher than than the value of totaling a typical car.
hmbnc2v,Stoic_Chief,11/27/2021,1,Here is an excerpt from my current lease:  &#x200B  >A. Automatic Renewal. Unless another Lease is   >   >signed by the parties hereto or unless a written notice of termination is given by either party sixty (60) days or more before the expiration of the term of this Lease   >   >this Lease shall be automatically renewed on a sixty (60) day basis at the month-to-month rental rate in effect immediately prior to the expiration of the prior term.  I need to look to see if they told me too last minute - they gave me a 12 days to figure out if Im staying or going and to find a new apartment if I decide to leave.
hmbogn6,Muted_Draft8561,11/27/2021,1,When I worked in-house as a lawyer anytime anyone accepted a counter offer their file got marked with a purple post it note and put in a different drawer. Half the time they were replaced within a year when we could train someone else up on what they were doing. The other half of the time they were excluded from promotions and raises unless it was completely unavoidable or had extra work dumped on them at every chance. This is why I tell people to never take the counter and why I am not longer a lawyer.
hmbob7k,mrchaotica,11/27/2021,1,Thats true but the inconvenience risk and expense to accomplish that devalues the property compared to one that has frontage on a public road.
hmafsfh,Pythias1,11/27/2021,1,I think hes almost certainly right about paying your loans first. Unless you have very low interest on your loans the cost of paying the loans slowly will outweigh the benefit of the match from your employer.  If your dad is saying to contribute $2-4k thats ~4-8% of your income anyway. If youre already contributing $2k the company will contribute $1k. The most your employer will ever contribute is just ~1.5k (3% of your salary) so if you contribute just $2k your only leaving $500 on the table from your employer. Definitely check your loans interest rate but I think its unlikely that increasing your contribution to $3k makes sense right now.  Also note that contributing $4k the upper limit of the range you and your dad discussed may not be the best idea. Youd probably be better off opening a Roth IRA and funding it with whatever you can afford to save beyond 6% of your salary.  Edit: OP said elsewhere they have only 1/2 month of expenses in liquid accounts. OP you have got to put more savings away before you throw lots of money at the 401(k). My own strategy was to put money into a ROTH IRA as an emergency fund because you can withdraw Roth contributions at any time. Your 401(k) is not to be included in emergency fund calculations because you will pay a penalty for accessing that money early.   I think your father is trying to gently tell you that what youre doing is reckless. He doesnt want to be your safety net when you do earn enough to make the right choices and be secure.
hmbqwrf,lucky_ducker,11/27/2021,1,After an accident the police will typically call for a tow to an impound lot. If you can quickly arrange a tow yourself (maybe have AAA Plus) have your car towed to a *body shop* not an impound lot. Ive done this twice in the past 20 something years and never had to pay for impound storage.
hmbg4xq,riselikethemoon,11/27/2021,1,I see lots of folks suggesting donating to a land trust or conservation group but also consider donating it to the local native tribe. They may or may not want it but it would be good to give them first dibs.  &#x200B  edit: you can look here to find out whose land it was: https://native-land.ca/
hmblzul,metstickets719,11/27/2021,1,If you plan to invest in vanguard funds it probably makes sense to open a vanguard account as I believe Fidelity charges extra fees for investing in those funds. You could also look into the fidelity equivalent of the funds you wish to invest in. I am into the Bogleheads approach so Im roughly 75/25 split between FZROX & FZILX which are the zero expense funds with Fidelity. FZROX is similar to VTI while FZILX is similar to VXUS.

hmb7f4d,Whoz_Yerdaddi,11/27/2021,1,Do you have a car loan?  Also if do you get a secured card get one that reports to all three bureaus (there are cards that specialize in building credit) and keep a low balance.   Im thinking that you may have a thin file which is holding you back. Lenders like to see different kinds of loans on your report credit available to you but unused and a low debt to income ratio.

hmaztfq,techcareerthrowaway,11/27/2021,1,I should clarify the insurance posted as $116/month is medical/dental/eye insurance. I have no student debt.  Thats a good idea I will split my disposable income into individual funds. Thanks so much for your advice!!
hmau28f,Diesel-66,11/27/2021,1,Look at your credit report.    Do you use cc and pay off monthly? That would still count
hm90d5j,ZijoeLocs,11/27/2021,1,Its more like a legal loophole that the agencies take advantage of. Because financial debt is tied to ones social security number they can use that to look up immediate family members and their contact information (just addresses and phone numbers)  You paying on (and subsequently becoming responsible for) the deceased persons debt is the lowest effort and most cost effective avenue the Agency can take. They can only do it with immediate family members however (children siblings grandchildren). Legally they can get your contact information to confirm the death of the owner of the debt but really they use it to hassle you  Option B is they basically just write it off on their taxes. Depends on the original debtor agency amount and type of debt. They lose out on collecting interest but thats really it  Option C is the nuclear option. They can seek to collect from the estate of the deceased which is more emotionally traumatizing than youd think. Before the deceased possessions can be passed on to the family (unless explicitly stated in the will) the original debtor or the collection agency can get first dibs. House car jewelry books electronics. Anything of notable value. However this can be fought in court by the family but its a very emotionally draining process

hmbmldt,Undercovergreen,11/27/2021,1,The insurance company isnt under any obligation to make your premium cheaper. Youre doing the right thing by checking other companies but the only way to get it cheaper is to pull the trigger on a different provider. Some providers are better than others but you should be able to find someone willing to be more compeitive to attract you. To answer your broader question i dont think your dad is overcharging you but if he were to migrate all his cars he may save money on every car. There will be a big difference when you turn 25 but until then youre in the high risk group and youre gonna pay a lot.
hmboxr3,hurricanedan229,11/27/2021,1,Yeah thats another good thought. Thanks for your input

hmbnh2i,Valendorf,11/27/2021,1,My resume has been online since having resumes online became a thing.  I update it after every noteworthy change.  Keep looking.

As long as you don‚Äôt show this as a pattern aka a new job every 2 months for a solid year or two it won‚Äôt be an issue in the future.
hmb4nny,xhoi,11/27/2021,1,You arent too late at all. Start reading up on Bogleheads check out Investopedia and learn about the tax advantaged options available to you (401k IRA HSA) as well as the various platforms for those accounts and normal taxable brokerage accounts.   Check out the PF wiki for some other advice and learn to look at ETFs and mutual funds instead of just picking individual stocks. Individual stocks can be fun but its really just gambling at that point.
hmb5tdd,JeanATannen,11/27/2021,1,If I were in your position I‚Äôd stretch the house budget a bit and get something that you are happy with. Housing is such a mess and it‚Äôs so difficult to get something right now and it just gets harder every year.   You cannot easily scale up your house with each raise you get so I don‚Äôt think the lifestyle creep with housing is as much of a concern especially if you like your house.   What will probably happen over the next 5 years is that the novelty of your house will wear off you‚Äôll be making more money and you‚Äôll be tempted to up the house budget again. You‚Äôll have to re-evaluate your priorities then and trust your future self to make a smart decision. You can help your future self by staying in control of your finances and keeping track of your long term goals and what you‚Äôll need to do to achieve them. I‚Äôd recommend bumping your 401k contributions for starters.
hmbn5yp,anthonyp17,11/27/2021,1,Appreciate your response. I hadnt thought of talking to my boss but I have heard of CPAs through coworkers that I could speak with.

hm9q8qb,GoatzQI,11/27/2021,1,Tell them the truth. You were in a rear end accident  and didn‚Äôt realize the damage was as bad as it is until further inspection at home. They will advise you as to what steps you need to take. Contrary to popular belief not all rear end accidents are the fault of the car in the rear. If it is deemed your fault then it could raise your rates. If she is at fault and her insurance covers the damage you should be fine.. Assuming she even has insurance. I‚Äôd definitely file an accident report if you can so that it is on record. A lot of places allow you to do this online.

hmbsbiq,imitation_crab_meat,11/27/2021,1,This is one time it pays to be. If you were male youd pay more.  Would your dad care if you got your own insurance? Youre an adult... Assuming you live with him he would likely need to exclude you from his insurance explicitly which means youd be unable to drive his car(s) but all that takes is a call to the insurance company to do its pretty routine.
hmbh1by,MFSHou,11/27/2021,1,I always recommend downloading your insurance carrier app to your device. Most of the insurers have one.  It‚Äôs the most convenient way to access everything related to your plan from ID cards EOBs provider and prescription lookups etc etc.

hmbo3aa,USdiaspora,11/27/2021,1,To answer your question you will pay penalty and tax on earnings in the Roth if you begin withdrawing early - contributions can be withdrawn anytime. Almost all countries where you are resident will tax the Roth withdrawals as income exceptions are countries with no income tax and those with special treaties with the US such as the UK. Unless you plan on dodging taxes. Good luck

hmbl4kq,urza5589,11/27/2021,1,The social security website. As long as you have been paying in for 10 years or more it should let you I believe
hmbgafj,kepler1,11/27/2021,1,Yes you could make a quarterly payment to reduce some or all of your under-withholding.   Youll need to read up on how quarterly payments if they come unevenly during the year will be used to calculate the amount of interest owed.   If I recall correctly you roughly pay a penalty in interest according to the number of tax quarters by which you underpaid.   I think this is form 1040-ES and related instructions.  But note there are 2 other factors that might make this less painful.   In any case when you underpay / under-withhold during the year the penalty for doing so is an interest % charge on the amount by which you under-withheld and for how long it was under-withheld.  So even if you owe thousands at tax time due to under-withholding you only pay a smaller % penalty for not having withheld properly (and you wouldve had to pay the tax amount anyway).   Second underpayment penalties will not apply if you paid during the year withholding and estimated tax of at least 90% of the tax for the current year or 100% of the tax shown on the return for the prior year.   (110% for certain higher income households)    -- directly from the IRS: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306  So if you happen to qualify by that criterion you may not owe any penalty at all.  Of course you still have to pay the tax amount due.

hmb8srm,TodaysMenace,11/27/2021,1,Came here to say this. Your credit card is a revolving account. You also should have a history of making amortized payments. To build credit for my wife I opened a CD and borrowed the exact amount against it. Worked like a charm.
hmbpa6y,SerbLing,11/27/2021,1,In your situation spending 30k extra is fine. In my country you would be able to borrow 400000-500000 (4* annual income basically) and easily make monthly payments on that salary I dont think you need to stress about this at all

hmat46o,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,No each states plan(s) are usually just for the tax credit. The money itself can be used on any qualified educational expense.
hmb5x0c,wild_b_cat,11/27/2021,1,I would start with an emergency fund in cash and contributing to your Roth IRA. You don‚Äôt want your IRA invested aggressively if you might need to pull that money back out so be cautious about considering it part of your emergency fund but there‚Äôs an argument for at least getting the money in there so that you don‚Äôt lose the contribution space. If you wind up not needing the money you‚Äôll already have it ready to invest for the long term.   I understand the appeal of crypto but you cannot expect those returns to repeat and indeed there‚Äôs a reasonable chance they do not grow at all. With your limited resources I would invest somewhere between ‚Äòlittle‚Äô and ‚Äònothing‚Äô in crypto.  I bonds are not really a good solution for you right now.

hmbf2wu,invenio78,11/27/2021,1,Most people when they get married will share ownership of assets.  Like their house cars bank accounts brokerage accounts.  Thus one one spouse gets sued these will be all fair game.  Also risk doesnt necessarily come with occupation.  The mail man slip on your front porch and sues you for $2 million...  I guess you could make really complicated asset separation to try and keep assets separate but 50% on each side but even then you are basically back to the original risk of being not married.  Marriage innately does not give asset protection that two unmarried people wouldnt intrinsically have.

hmbk3ez,tstill_,11/27/2021,1,So you called a financial advisor you didnt want to give them details about your plans for your money but you wanted their advice?
hmae74v,sf_torquatus,11/27/2021,1,You dont want the purchase of a car to set you behind financially. Use whatever rule you prefer to estimate a reasonable auto cost (10 % rule etc).   You can get a decent car for new or near-new for the 19k-24k range. But if I were you Id buy $5k car of a reliable brand and keep it running for a few years. Even if it costs you $1k/yr in repairs you will still be ahead on the costs of a newer car. Save up for whatever car you want and try to outlast the price inflation.
hmb6kc6,briinde,11/27/2021,1,We‚Äôll it can get you closer faster. So you‚Äôd be getting $1170 off a month in principle and you need to clear $68000 or so in principle to get under PMI. Also you should appreciate in value over time so you could get there in like 3-4 years.

hmazqu2,cownan,11/27/2021,1,Ive even had trouble getting a cashiers check. Also for a car purchase negotiated the deal and the trade in on my previous car. I had transferred $30k from my investment account to my checking account a month previous. After everything I needed a cashiers check for ~24k. When I went to my local branch they kept me waiting for 45 mins while they called various people. They needed a signature at a certain level for the check I ended up needing to leave and come back the next day. It was a hassle and this was at Wells Fargo (not a little local bank)
hmb3wm1,Cetun,11/27/2021,1,Get it from the tow yard presumably the cost of towing and the time in the tow yard is recoverable from your insurance. However with damages there is one caveat you have to do everything within your power to reduce the amount of damages. So if you have the power to get the car from the tow companys lot and you refuse to do so and it makes getting the car from the tow companys lot more expensive you may be responsible for that entire bill.   You have a duty to reduce damages the car in the lot is increasing damages get the car out of the lot send a bill to the insurance company.

hmbbvmi,SolutionLeading,11/27/2021,1,What‚Äôs your expected income once you get your masters? I would take that into account vs your expected debt upon graduation and use that to make your decision.
hmbl9qw,thememeconnoisseurig,11/27/2021,1,There is a difference but for my purposes they have identical uses.  Frankly they are so similar I cant quite remember the differences. I believe ETFs are traded like stocks and index/mutual funds have SLIGHTLY different terms.  I suggest googling it to find the exact differences if youre curious.
hm9mxt0,swampler22,11/27/2021,2,Ok Ill definitely get with my HR rep and ask them about it then. Thank you.
hmbr6ur,BruceCourteous4444,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for the recommendation. Are these two funds enough? Would you recommend just these two funds?
hmbhgr2,HappyHound,11/27/2021,1,Before you claim its worth a thousand dollars get an appraisal. I would be very hard pressed to believe its $200 an acre.
hmba3vi,Brazenjalapeno,11/27/2021,1,Unfortunately you are on the hook for the loan. Car is irrelevant at this point. Source for a job immediately to try and make the payments. I would also call the financing company and see if they offer hardship grace periods. This can buy you some time but the payments get added to the end of your lease.   Selling the car is the next best option if you don‚Äôt find a job. Worst thing to do is stop paying. Do not let it get repossessed because then you are out of a car and you‚Äôll end up over paying for everything in the future. Best of luck!
hm8v2f9,LifeIsVanilla,11/27/2021,24,Weve all been pretty much drilled that the authorities cannot act until a crime has taken place and further them being caught red handed. This is of course bs but more importantly companies are usually ready to cut ties with employees and take the chance of being sued very serious after that if anything does happen theres already a clear evidence trail to who did it. However that involves a lot of stress to navigate and not reporting or participating is the path of least resistance(reasoned with the until a crime myth).
hmbfswe,cownan,11/27/2021,1,Thanks I appreciate the input. I do love to travel but I also have young kids (12 and 8) and as a single dad I dont know if Im ready to give up the safety of a regular paycheck. I also want to set a good example for them you know showing them a good work ethic. I dont think Id set a good example being the daddy that sleeps in late takes lots of naps and plays his guitar all day haha
hmbhhlr,xxxsoap,11/27/2021,1,There is some solid advice here. To reiterate paying off a debt is a guaranteed return. Having debt isnt a bad thing but theres a difference between a 3.4% Auto Loan and a 16-23% variable interest credit card.   Cryptocurrency markets are volatile so you might be able to get a higher return than 23%. However if the interest owed is lets say 15% on 9k you have to get at least a 45% return on 3k of Cryptocurrency just to break even. Just crunch the numbers but tbh itd be best to pay off the debt and cost average back into your investments.
hmbf42v,CQME,11/27/2021,1,>I have 3k in debts at a 5% interest and 4k in emergency funds with 55k in stocks which I want to leave as a long position but I could pull them out on a 3 day notice for extra emergency funds.  It sounds like youre aware that a prudent thing to do would be to further pad your emergency fund a bit so that you wont have to sell stocks in an emergency.  If an emergency like say job loss occurred concomitantly with a recession (happens all the time) your stocks will get pummeled and youll have to sell precisely when you want to be buying.  >I think the problem with this is we are basically paying out 39% of our income to pay for our current place with both of us working 44 hours a week. Ideally I want that to be closer to 30%.  Yes good.  >So if I got a condo for 240k. Sold 40k stock as a down payment and then our payments would be 1100 a month before insurance and utilities.  Youre going to need a (much) bigger cash cushion.  If you get a condo youll probably have HOA fees on top of taxes and insurance.  This will probably make your condo purchase significantly less affordable on a monthly basis than what you are doing now.  Youre also going to have to set aside optimally $15-20k for unexpected maintenance issues...after all its your condo you have to fix it.  IMHO I dont think youre ready for this yet you need more planning and ideally more cash.  You can instead pay a lot less down and hold onto that extra cash for these contingencies just be aware that your monthly expenses are likely going to go up not down if you make your planned purchase.  >Would planning on doing something like this in 24 to 36 months be a bad idea? Hoping by then Im making 15% more and her too. Im not sure if hone ownership is feasible for a couple making 90k in annual before taxes in this market.  This sounds feasible especially if both of you work towards saving up cash for this purchase.  You may also want to consider getting out of the stock market now if you are going to rely upon those funds for your down payment in order to decrease risk and volatility.  >What things do I need to think about financially for the next few years getting married etc?  This is a much bigger question lol...depends upon what yall want to do after getting married.  =)
hmabm8z,Thelton26,11/27/2021,1,Marriage like most anything else can be as expensive as you want it to be. And whether or not youre married you are both buying food paying rent and utilities etc. The wedding itself and the ring can be extremely expensive but youve already talked about that and want it to be reasonable.  As far as combining finances I personally think its a good idea. It keeps you on the same page and there wont be any debates about my money and your money or one of you paying for something. The money is both of yours and goes into a pool.

hmbrhpg,pineapplecats495,11/27/2021,1,Im thinking about opening a 529 college savings acct for my child but everywhere says to max out your retirement accounts first. my husband maxes out his 401k already and I have a pension so Im not too concerned. we already max out the roth iras too...I do have a separate 403b which isnt as good as a 401k in terms of protections...should I max out the 403b or open the 529? I live in California so there‚Äôs no real tax advantage to the 529 besides tax free growth which the 403b would be the same.
hmai4uo,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,If you know your minimum acceptability in a home the next set of questions is determining the value to you of the options above and beyond the minimum.  I married a general building contractor. So I married possibilities with most any home. I tease him and tell I looked deep into my eyes and saw by dream kitchen.   My point is to think outside the buts to see if maybe theyre more like  but for right now or until we [fill in the blank].   Seriously interrogate every want and every but to see the value to you. Itll help with decisions.   And on a personal note may I add in the suggestion to periodically say out loud nice problems to have and thank goodness I dont have to make perfect decisions just to help keep things in perspective.   I wish you every happiness in your future.

hmaefb2,raznog,11/27/2021,1,Yeah I have a few banks. USAA was the first I could deposit checks with phone. Now they pretty much all have it. Though I have to say last few years USAA has really gone the wrong way. Their support is not nearly as good as it used to be their services are subpar and very expensive. It used to be amazing but I‚Äôve started dropping them because they aren‚Äôt nearly as good as they used to be.
hm99zvp,vgacolor,11/27/2021,5,Assuming the following:  1) You stop working for four years to get your degree.    2) You have $15000 in expenses associated with tuition and books each of the next four years.     3) You get 2.5% raises every year in your current job and 6% raises every year in the CS job.     4) We discount every salary and expense to the present value using 2%.    You will make more money by sticking with your current job. Ten years from now the CS job salary will surpass the current job ($80.3K vs $78.7K) and by the time you retire in 23 years the difference will be significant ($171.3K vs $108.5K) but the fact that you will be giving up the next four years of compensation and start at a lower amount in year 5 is not fixable. Also we are assuming that CS salaries will continue to outpace inflation by using a 6% growth rate. That might not be the case. Then again inflation might remain high in that case throw the model away.    By the way the present value of the CS job is $1.21 Million and the present value of the current job is $1.53 Million. (Discounting the salaries). I did not look at the savings for retirement but it is clear that using up $100000 right now and not saving for the next four years will wipe out any benefit of higher salaries after year 10.
hmb7ihu,TimeCitizen,11/27/2021,1,Sorry about the predicament you‚Äôre in. It‚Äôs not fun when we are faced with unexpected expenses. Is there any chance the destination you‚Äôre traveling to is public transport friendly? Maybe you could leverage that instead of renting a car.
hma7qt9,ThisIsAMonere,11/27/2021,1,‚ÄúI was under the assumption it‚Äôs better to save than pay off mortgage early.‚Äù  Spending money on a vacation isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsaving‚Äù and even it it was the assumption above is incorrect.  I think you meant to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs better to *invest* than to pay off the house early.‚Äù This *can* be true but only if you‚Äôre committed to putting the money available to throw at the house payment into investments instead. You‚Äôve clearly said you‚Äôre not doing that (you‚Äôre spending your extra $7000 a year on vacations not investments or savings.)  Anyways none of the above really matters. What matters is your values and priorities.  Right now you value your vacations *more* thank you value your retirement. That‚Äôs okay and it sounds like we won‚Äôt change your mind.  You just need to know that you are *choosing* to retire many years later than you otherwise could if you put some of that vacation money into retirement investments instead.  You also need to know that from one perspective the vacation it doesn‚Äôt really cost you $7000 it costs you the value of lost gains over the next 30-35 years as well. See example below:  Assuming you put that $7000 into investments instead every year you‚Äôd gain about $400000 in interest over the next 30 years.  So you‚Äôre choosing to *not earn* $400000 for the sake of these vacations. Again nothing wrong with that! You just need to know that over the course of the next 30 years these vacations cost you $400000 more than you are think you are paying.   Again and I‚Äôm going to sound like a broken record: This is a fine choice and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with valuing your vacations more than valuing your retirement.  Just know that in making that choice you‚Äôre choosing to work for however many years *longer* it will take you to retire since you‚Äôre not investing that money. (Perhaps you can retire at 75 instead of 60 due to prioritizing these vacations? You‚Äôd need to put it into a calculator to be sure.)

hmb43aa,theEucalyptus,11/27/2021,1,The 2021 limit for 401k contributions is $19.5k that is inclusive for both pre- and post-tax accounts. Because youve already reached the 2021 limit with you previous employer you arent eligible to contribute any more this year.
hmae6t6,Earthquake14,11/27/2021,1,I think my 5% was like $125 per paycheck so with company‚Äôs contribution it‚Äôs around $500 a month iirc.

hm9tomh,batwing71,11/27/2021,1,Back in ‚Äò08 my 401k balance was about 60k. Through the crisis of ‚Äò09 it dropped down to near 25k. I was concerned. I started thinking about my ‚Äòdrop dead number.‚Äô For me I decided at 15k I would sell and buy into the cash investment. It started going up at around 24k. Through the whole drop I continued contributions and even raised it a bit. By 2012 I had near 180k. TLDR stay the course for the long term increase contributions if you can. When stocks drop your current investments/contributions can buy more.
hmbnaah,zhonzhon,11/27/2021,1,FICO is the one typically used.  and there are three credit agencies that report FICO (transuniuon experian and equifax).  even your fico score will vary between the three agencies.   typically the highest score from the three agencies is used.
hmbksl7,Adorable_Tour_2892,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the reply!  1. Thats my thought. Although technically a true 6 month emergency fund with our current $14000 monthly spending would be $84k which seems way excessive. If we really were in an emergency lost a job situation wed cut our spending and I could defer my loans which places the real 6 month fund near $30-35k. Thats where I came up with that number to keep in the savings account. 2. I currently have no IRA set up. Just what goes into our 401k and then a fidelity brokerage account. Ive looked into the roth backdoor you think thatd be superior to putting into a brokerage? 3. Thanks for the feedback! Tough battling with my self looking at the potential versus getting out of debt.
hmaagl6,robb0995,11/27/2021,1,The stubs may state what dates they‚Äôre paying you for (pay period beginning/end) but I‚Äôm not sure what a reissued check would look like.   Regardless just call and ask them. If you were overpaid they‚Äôll tell you how to pay them back to avoid any problems.
hmb9d9q,Kakatus100,11/27/2021,1,I dont like to buy this argument. Life is a risk. How about the converse you dont invest and miss out on the extra returns on income so later on in life you cant actually afford that medical treatment and end up dying.  Life is full of unknowns all we can do is make the best decisions based on statistics and rational not fear.

If you dont have rain gutters they are good investment especially if you have flower beds or anything up close to the house. Putting up a fence is a lot more expensive than you think. Home warranties arent worth the money and will try to get out of fixing anything they can. If you live close to lots of oak trees plan to tent your house for termites at least once every 10 years (at least in Florida anyways). Always call 811 before digging because stuff like fiber cables are usually only about an inch or 2 underground. This is the stuff Ive learned.

hmapol2,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,You cant beat the Prime Directive for solid advice. Your thinking is pretty sound you are just adjusting to a lot of change in a short period. Overall no harm in keeping it simple for now and improving as you learn.  The PD will suggest 3-6 months living  expense as an emergency fund. That basically means cash not investments that can vary in value and not be available nearly immediately. If you dont have that already put the money there first.   Whats not covered in the PD is the specifics to your situation. First unless your wife sets up as a company (complex and probably not worth it) she doesnt have access to a 401k what you (as a couple) can do is contribute up to $6K/year to an IRA in her name.    For 2021 it may make sense to do Roth for 2021 it sounds like you will be in traditional (ie not Roth) territory.    Life tends to get more expensive as soon as money becomes available (ex.: new apartment). By bumping up your retirement funding now (you too can do an IRA for 2021 up until April 2022) you make investing a healthy routine and set yourself up for financial success.
hmbhiz6,veloharris,11/27/2021,1,They can be part of it. If youre starting paying into a 401k and/or IRA youre definitely not too late. Invest in a target date fund and youll be set.
hmb0ujr,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,Check your credit report theres a chance incorrect data is in there. If so work towards getting it corrected. You can ask the bank which credit reporting agency they pull from or just check all three of the big ones. Its free to get a copy from each agency once per year.  [https://www.annualcreditreport.com/](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/)  If its not an inaccuracy in your report that particular bank might just not extend credit to people with essentially zero credit history. Google something like best credit cards to build credit or best first credit card. Certain cards are more apt to accept borrowers with limited credit history.

hmb8ym1,alto-sun,11/27/2021,1,I have but have not found anything that really works yet. Ive gotten tired of spending money on expensive products that have harsh side effects (some of which left even worse scars) and having my skin inspected and I feel ashamed that its gotten so bad over time.  I guess this is probably outside the realm of PF. But its just an example of something I refused to spend money on and had snowballing consequences.
hmb6w4s,atx78701,11/27/2021,1,what is safe? economists and financial advisors define risk as beta which is a measure of volatility. They would say high beta and high volatility is unsafe (risky).  I personally dont care about beta at all as Im in for the very long haul. Over a long enough time period (eg. 10 years) beta doesnt really matter.  Invest in americas best companies (eg S&P 500) and over the long term they will definitely grow and so will the value of their stocks.  To me putting money in a bank account is about as unsafe as you can be as you are guaranteed to lose money due to inflation but there is no volatility at all.  I personally would make sure that I had enough emergency funds in cash. The rest would go into VITAX (technology index fund).
hmb3bhv,bigbura,11/27/2021,1,Arent financial woes one of the top 3 reasons for divorce? Pre-marriage counseling should cover this issue and many more.   What or how other people think about handling money doesnt really matter to any one couple.   What is important is how a specific couple feels about money issues.   The best time to find out how well their feelings align is prior to marrying hence the advice for couples to make the time for pre-marriage counseling.

hmbag6p,Orangesunset98,11/27/2021,1,Maybe pay for the groceries you use and a portion of the rent/mortgage. Make sure to have this in writing!

hm9uyra,RedalMedia,11/27/2021,1,Totally understand but is it smart? For a small $10 product people will choose Amazon over a random seller on the web because one assumes certain things about that smaller seller. Then why not apply similar standards for more important things in life?  If a parent will to ANYTHING to physically secure a child (from buying the highest quality feeding bottles to sacrificing everything to keep the baby safe) then why not apply the same thought process to the financial security of the child?

Be sure to read the limitations on redemptions ([https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod\_ibonds\_glance.htm](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_ibonds_glance.htm) scroll down to Redemption Information).

hmbkg5z,Bandgeek7,11/27/2021,1,They mean that insurance tends to be much more expensive until you turn 25. In general thats true.
hmbbt1c,minnesotaguy1232,11/27/2021,1,Don‚Äôt get married for financial reasons. But being married has some financial benefits. 2 incomes 1 rent/mortgage. Tax benefits
hmbe6hp,joelmole79,11/27/2021,1,I did not have my financial house in order until I got married but I also married someone who was responsible.  This said don‚Äôt expect marriage to change someone in that regard. If they have bad financial habits and/or are not a high earner consider the likelihood that this will continue into marriage. That is the part that is really expensive along with divorce. Raising a family buying a house and lifestyle creep is also very expensive. But these are things you potentially do to build the life you want.  Once you are married and especially if you have kids you now have obligations to people other than yourself. These obligations are costly but can spur you to take more responsibility for your future if you have a good head on your shoulders. I don‚Äôt think I would have been motivated to advance my career without this kick in the butt.  But above all you need to make sure you talk honestly about priorities with your partner and the sort of life you are striving to build and make sure you are on the same sheet of music.  It‚Äôs easy to get into a situation where you‚Äôve committed your time talents and treasure to borrow a turn of phrase to something that you doesn‚Äôt bring you happiness. Time is the most precious commodity so guard that and use it wisely above all else.
hm93ca5,N3wBee33,11/27/2021,1,Credit is in the 700s
hmb8kw1,Altruistic_Profile96,11/27/2021,1,On a debit card it can get dicey.  Lesser banks would fight it.  I don‚Äôt get charged for anything with USAA so I don‚Äôt know what high costs to which you refer.  My insurance costs went up for a bit and I switched but after some improvements the insurance is cheaper than anything I‚Äôve seen but everybody should shop their insurance around every five years or so.
hmb2okw,lippoper,11/27/2021,1,You want a safe investment. But are afraid of the rewards?  I‚Äôm confused. You want to get paid less for your dollar then buy bonds under your parents portfolio?
hmba2kp,_c4rli3,11/27/2021,1,Because that‚Äôs what the provider instructed me to do there weren‚Äôt any other options & this one doesn‚Äôt have an app
hmanq1y,extrapolatorman,11/27/2021,1,I would keep it but if you really want to get rid of it quit paying the taxes on it and the County will put a lien on it and take it off your hands for free.
hm9x125,ghostrecon11,11/27/2021,1,Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. There is the possibility of looking for something else in the future after seeing how things go in the next few months
hm9wfw3,aaaaij,11/27/2021,1,The great thing about investing in highly diversified index funds is that there really is absolutely no reason to worry. If your investments go down so does everyone elses. There is no need to check - the news will tell you if something major happens and when the next 2008 housing crisis or 2020 pandemic comes along where things really tumble you will definitely know about it and can do what you can to BUY MORE while the price is low.
hma7n0q,bros402,11/27/2021,1,You could set up a trust for them with specific payout terms - that might be the smart idea. Maybe some caveats like if money is needed for living expenses they must provide receipts/proof and the money will be paid from the trust to the person who is owed the money
hmb3ilb,obviousarrest,11/27/2021,1,Likely yes. If it‚Äôs an 18 mo (I am not sure if it goes that far out) then I don‚Äôt see a problem. Although now that I remember there will be a 2.5% finance charge for paying through cc. But I‚Äôll confirm.
hmb1qjd,Motobugs,11/27/2021,1,Why not? Theres literally no harm at all if HDHP is appropriate for here.
hmabqq1,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Ill play devils advocate and reply differently.  Do you really want to start the buying process all over again someplace else?  Can they drive the paperwork to you?  Why a babysitter? I would bring my screaming children in let them run around the place.  Have them throw in some free oil changes or something to make amends.
hmbj64c,champac,11/27/2021,1,Really annoying to know that. But thanks a lot of information
hma6rbt,ftblplyr46,11/27/2021,1,Lol what? You‚Äôre still paying for it you have to pay it back. It‚Äôs like a car loan. Many people on here say not to pay cash for a loan under certain circumstances.   Yes FAFSA is there and should be there for people who need it but you shouldn‚Äôt be required to drain every account you have to pay for already outrageously priced education which is how they look at it.   I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm the unpopular opinion but it‚Äôs just that my opinion. I don‚Äôt think and expect to have to drain every account I have or saved for my kid to give them a head start to pay a greedy institution an overpriced education simply because most careers want a stupid piece of paper that said you went there for 4 years.

hmag7gg,ploetzlichbanana,11/27/2021,1,Like I said were comfortable but were not super rich either. I dont think we will exceed a few dozen thousands per child over the period. Lets call it 100k per child at age 18 including the re-invested interests to be on the safe side.
hmatkrr,lainey822,11/27/2021,1,Why wouldnt it be possible to rent cheap? Perhaps getting roommates to lower down the cost? Perhaps that person who lives in a high cost area cant afford it? All the things I said are all common sense.  And you said it is not possible for everyone and perhaps those people are not willing to sacrifice to cut cost. But I do understand building wealth is not for everyone...only for the few who understand what it takes.
hmbmfs4,exconsultingguy,11/27/2021,1,Newer (past 20 years or so) heat pumps work just fine in the northeast. I‚Äôd venture 75% of PA uses heat pumps some with natural gas for secondary heat some with electric.   I also live in Philly and our 2018 Goodman heat pump is good down to ~25 degrees. Then the electric secondary heat kicks in.

This question shows that you have room to learn more. I think Im earning around $8 per month on a $20k balance right now and thats in a so called high interest account. Your money is not growing in the bank.

hmbm791,bicyclemom,11/27/2021,1,Is there a state or county park it could be donated too?
hma94yx,MathandMarketsCFA,11/27/2021,1,>Overweighting dividends (especially when young) isn‚Äôt the best strategy since you‚Äôre giving up on growth when you ostensibly have a very long time horizon.  This isnt true under the assumptions of an efficient market. The expected return of any name you own assuming equal levels of systematic risk should return the same amount: dividend yield + expected capital gains. If this werent the case and a name was expected to return more via capital gains + dividend yield then the price would rise until the levels of expected return are equal.   The key difference not yet mentioned is the differing tax regimes for dividends and capital gains.  In a regime where dividends are taxed more favorably youd hold a higher percentage of dividend yielding firms than otherwise and vice versa.  This all gets a bit more complex when you take into consideration individuals have different risk aversion coefficients than the market as a whole but most do not get so into the weeds.
hmah8s6,cdbessig,11/27/2021,1,Hey I‚Äôm from nj.  You can be excluded from the mortgage but still be on the deed.  Meaning you own 50% and your husband owes 100%.  Source: me.  I did this in nj.  My wife did not have any credit and was a new immigrant and it was going to be a hastle to deal with getting her on the mortgage.  So we didn‚Äôt.
hma8y5k,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,> you should pay extra toward principal each month to own the house faster  Interest on a mortgage is ~2.5-3% right now. Paying extra on principle makes sense if you cant find a 20+ year investment that beats 2.5-3%. OP still has room in 401k/IRA so their gains will be compounded tax free.
hmamv21,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,Dont understand why you got downvoted seriously. You gave one concrete example.    People downvotes should be for comments that are not constructive to the conversation or are seriously flawed. This was neither. Not my choice personally either but an option that some may consider.
hmafpu9,gubbabubbagump,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for your advice. This is very helpful!
hmbdssa,trekologer,11/27/2021,1,Ok they only took a couple months to notice. Still doesnt give a lot of confidence that the landlord has good record-keeping.   The fact that the bank has no record that the check was cashed means that the check wasnt cashed. Im not letting the bank off the hook that they didnt actually send the check either. The bank should cancel the check and either send a new one or return the money to OPs account.
hm9saue,pestowitch,11/27/2021,1,Keep in mind that math is based on the expensive plan you laid out here. It would be much cheaper to spend a year self teaching and passing a few udemy certificates be honest with yourself if you are understanding the material. Set a specific block of time to do it like 9-12am Saturday and Tuesday nights 7-9pm just as an example. If you can do that with sustained self motivation for year then consider paying for a boot camp.
hmbctua,Biaazz,11/27/2021,1,Thank you! Does this 30% that I save every month stay in my general account or do I send it to some specific place? is it like hide from the money i can use so i dont mess up?
hmbes84,Frogmarsh,11/27/2021,1,You could give it to a land conservancy with tax advantages. Land conservancies are often location-specific. Where I live in western Wisconsin it is the Mississippi Valley Conservancy.
hmbdxg1,asparagus21,11/27/2021,1,Its weird but the cost is almost the same to have the heat set to 60 (our minimum) vs 68. So unfortunately setting the heat to low doesnt affect the bill much turning off the heat slashes it dramatically though.
hmba1jl,mymomswedding,11/27/2021,1,Yeah I feel awful. But this will literally hurt my chances of finishing my degree if I do this

hm9lvgf,yamaha2000us,11/27/2021,1,This is sound advice. My wife and I both worked 2 jobs after college so by the time we were 25 had paid off our student loans. This type of planning has paid off over the past 30 years.  The goal being living reasonably your entire life vs retiring with as much money as you can.   You don‚Äôt get a return on your investment until you sell but debt is with you always.
hm9p3cz,retroPencil,11/27/2021,1,Call your bank and say ‚Äúsomeone stole my money.‚Äù Your bank will tell you next steps.  You willingly let your friends have your debit card info and Social Security number? You will want to freeze your credit. You can look into this in the sidebar for fraud.
hmb0h3u,One-Kind-Word,11/27/2021,1,Thank you.
hmbd3y1,SCwareagle,11/27/2021,1,See if he would be interested in checking out The Money Guy. I liked Dave and his philosophy and it was my intro to personal finance. But I like the Money Guy approach even better.   I would say Dave is perfect for those who really struggle with the behavior side of personal finance and need very strict controls and boundaries. Money Guy is better for those trying to be as efficient as possible. Tons of overlap in philosophy though.  Also watching or listening to some of it together and discussing could be a good tool to make sure you are on the same page in terms of financial philosophy and goals.
hmaxgm4,wanna_be_doc,11/27/2021,1,Download an app like Mint or You Need A Budget.   The first goal of budgeting is figuring out exactly where your money is going.  These apps can help you track your expenses on your credit cards so you‚Äôll see exactly how much you‚Äôre spending on various categories.  If you‚Äôre spending a thousand dollars eating out each month then you know what to cut.  If it‚Äôs clothes then it‚Äôs that.   Find where your money is going each month and then work on cutting back your major line items.
hm9dzom,ShootinAllMyChisolm,11/27/2021,5,I pay my babysitter  with a check that is generated by my bank. One time it was cashed but not by her. She‚Äôs honest. The bank wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it. Until I got police involved. I filed a police report and the cop called the bank and wouldn‚Äôt you know-resolved in 48 hours.   They had sent it to a local business by accident and that business cashed it. They had to have known all along and/or could‚Äôve looked it up easily.   Go the cop route first. Then escalate to threatening to get your lawyer involved. The latter also has worked for some friends.
hmbbwc3,ShortHandz,11/27/2021,1,I would keep it for $25 bucks a year. You never know what the future will hold in store. Maybe it is worth $1000 now maybe its worth $100000 in 30 years. I would just keep it.

hmbgnnz,cownan,11/27/2021,1,Thats good feedback thanks! Im not super anti-debt (at least as far as mortgages go) I do feel the market is overheated and due for a maybe substantial correction. I think thats the source of my stress. It does feel like real estate is a good hedge right now stashing cash in the mortgage is a good thought which would let me retain the tax benefits of holding the mortgage - and I could always get it back through a cash out refi if I needed it.

hma31fy,StingrayRaider,11/27/2021,1,The cool part is once you have a baby it won‚Äôt cost too much because you won‚Äôt be able to travel internationally for a couple years. So you can just transfer that money toward baby expenses.
hm9feu4,Characterde,11/27/2021,2,Thats what Im doing. Ive been maxing out my IRA 401k HSA (i lost two years of HSA thinking the more expensive plan was better. It isnt) and i have been saving in individual brokerage account so that at 35 i wont ever need to contribute another penny to my retirement accounts. If i still work Ill contribute up to the match and invest rest of the money in individual investment account
hmae689,rickybobinski,11/27/2021,1,I would recommend seeing a doctor and waiting before stating there are no injuries. Been in 2 rear end accidents and days later I had soreness and pain that wasn‚Äôt there the day of the accident.
hmbnk0v,anthonyp17,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for the insight. Its taken on a much bigger percentage over the past 2 years 20% or so seems to still leave room for nice gains if it spikes over the long-term while protecting myself from downside and my emotional reasoning of not seeing the downside.
hmb1ogz,Default87,11/27/2021,1,There are but why not just use the mutual funds?  They are effectively the same thing.
hma0a7o,Zootallurs,11/27/2021,1,You‚Äôll probably be fine. A few things to consider.  1) I‚Äôd want quite a bit more liquid before leaving my job. Sure you‚Äôll get that small pension but who knows what happens with your ‚Äúsecond career?‚Äù It could take a long time to find the role you want it may pay a lot less than you expect you may end up hating it and want to leave after 6 months.   2) Take a hard look at your retirement savings. General guidance is that you want 6X your salary by the time you hit 50. I‚Äôm assuming the savings numbers you shared are for you and your SO combined and your salary is just you right? Even if your SO makes 1/2 what you do that means you want ~$800k in retirement accounts by 50. You can back your pension out of that if you don‚Äôt want to be so aggressive.   3) Get serious about the real estate. You didn‚Äôt give a lot of info but if the rents just ‚Äúcover the mortgage‚Äù you‚Äôre losing money. I would liquidate the rental properties and redeploy that capital to better RE investments. I personally think REI is the best retirement plan but you have to be smart and disciplined about it.

hmahww4,RoastyMcGiblets,11/27/2021,1,Land thats not buildable doesnt increase in value and you pay taxes on it yearly. You are taking on liability if someone gets hurt on the land or dumps stuff on it (including possibly anything toxic that requires expensive cleanup) that might cost you money. Low risk sure but why take on any risk if you arent making money?   If it was 100 acres and there was the possibility of a chunk of it maybe being developable someday it might be worth rolling the dice. Also larger plots of wetlands sometimes have value as developers can use them for leverage when doing new developments (they offer to dedicate it as public space with a conservation easement in exchange for being able to upzone the density for whatever they want to build). But 5 acres? Im with OP on this one pass.
hmbeeso,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/27/2021,1,Think of spending money on your happiness as an investment ‚Äî one to keep you productive.  You could also try to hunt for deals to combat your ingrained frugality.  Eg get a $400 pair of noise cancelling headphones on sale for $150 maximize the miles and points game to get a $300/night room for $75 worth of points etc.  That way you could treat yourself while also meeting your impulse to be frugal.
hmb6bdc,frzn_dad,11/27/2021,1,Havent ever run into a not scummy impound lot IRL. Have seen a few on youtube that seem all right but they are recovery companies not impound yards or that is what they show online anyway.
hmap6nj,Featherfy,11/27/2021,1,Just gonna add another recommendation to conservation/park for the sake of environmentally conscious choices. Wildlife at wetlands can be cool depending on what its like. Maybe the Audubon society in your state would be interested.
hmaj8uq,Ecstatic_Assumption5,11/27/2021,1,I have a BA in architecture and an MFA in photography. I mostly do Fine Art stuff but it‚Äôs almost impossible to make a living as an artist.

I just need to secure my identity and make sure this won‚Äôt interfere with my status that‚Äôs priority I guess.
hmayjkz,Anonymoose2021,11/27/2021,1,Banks will also question a large cash withdrawal if they suspect that their customer may be getting scammed.      Some customers have tried to get banks to absorb their losses by saying that the bank should have prevented them from withdrawing and paying the scammers.  You will also get a lot of questions asked of you if you go to a Walmart and try to purchase a large amount of gift cards as this is a common way for scammers to extract money from their victims.
hmbjwls,Anonymoose2021,11/27/2021,1,The tax implications of ISOs and NQs are very different.   This often leads people to exercise and hold ISO but to do an immediate exercise and sell of NQ options.   The NQ option gain from strike price to market price will be treated like W2 income.   The strike to market difference when exercising an ISO is AMT income but not ordinary income.   There is an AMT exemption amount so you should be exercising ISOs to just below the point where you owe AMT.  Co-workers particularly your boss (since he knows your option grant sizes) are generally a good place to start with your questions.   They may also have recommend stations for CPAs or CFPs that can help you plan the best way to handle the exercise of these options.
hmbcvpb,CQME,11/27/2021,1,This all depends upon what you think about crypto.  Theres a camp that says its the new money and will take over the world and then theres the other camp that says that its a nice brain teaser but nothing more.  People have speculated on crazy things in the past [the tulip bubble of the 1600s is case in point.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutch_tulip_bulb_market_bubble.asp)  If you believe this is going to be the new money youd probably want to hold on to your crypto.  If you think this is the latest mania to take over the market youd want to sell.
hma6ivv,S_Baime,11/27/2021,1,Early in my career I started putting 7% in my 401k.   Every time I got a raise half of it went into my 401k until I was putting in 18% plus the company match.  I did this on advice from my boss who was a good mentor to me.  I never missed what I didnt have. It worked out well.   Take care JP  FYI: At one point I reduced my 401K  down to 5% and put the difference into a Roth.  I was shocked how much went to taxes instead of the Roth.  I stopped doing that.
hmb4vgv,Specific-Rich5196,11/27/2021,1,I think given your jobs relies on your vehicle heavily I would not downgrade. 10k for a paid off vehicle is great and is not what is holding you back financially. 3 to 5k for a beater in this market would give you some pretty poor options and if they break down you are screwed since you need the car to do your job.  You know how you got here. Its just gonna take living on beans and rice as Dave Ramsey says. I think you will come out fine if you can save and pay off the debt as aggressively as you can. Maybe sell some other stuff you have to help but not the car.
hm9if6i,decaturbob,11/27/2021,2, a co-signer is co-signing the mortgage and hence is a borrower. That does not lead to ownership unless name is on deed/title
hmausyh,Duplicitous2,11/27/2021,1,Because of fair lending laws they arent allowed to discourage people from applying. Back when I was in a front line bank sales role if someone asked me if they were likely to get approved I would say that the only way to know is to apply and find out.

hmavt0d,Duplicitous2,11/27/2021,1,One of the worst offenders for this is buy here pay here car lenders and they make money on the down payments not the financing. Imagine if you could collect 1000 up front on a car worth about 5k total knowing you would have to repossess in 60 days anyway. Then you get the car back and sell it to the next person rinse lather repeat.
hma06ed,tastygluecakes,11/27/2021,1,Predictor tools are exactly that - tools.  Most assume an average return for your asset allocation.  What isn‚Äôt always clear is whether the calculators account for what most people do which is shift to lower yield safer assets as they near retirement.  If the calc assumes you are making 7-9% in the market until the day you retire that‚Äôs obviously a huge source of error and underestimating how much you need to contribute.  Try a few calculators and err on the side of caution when planning.    How large is your company?  The high compensation limitations are legit - that‚Äôs a stipulation of have a safe harbor compliant plan.  But 6% cap is pretty crappy for a cap most companies ‚Äúfix‚Äù this by making safe harbor compliant contributions to everybody to bring up the average to around 6% which means you can go to 8%.  I‚Äôd ask HR what they are doing to bring up the average overall - 4% avg is not a good sign for the average employees retirement savings health.    The purpose of the law is to cap executives to incentivize them to help average employees save more.  Not to penalize high earners.
hm9ykuq,vgacolor,11/27/2021,1,$60000 like OP said. I think it depends on where you live and if you go more towards programming than the network side.  Using OPs numbers to be honest I am not that familiar with CS salaries other than programmers and developers making mint if they work for the right employer.    I am also concerned at future downward pressure on those salaries as working remotely from eastern europe and India will be the same as working in California.

hma7tlj,Dilettantest,11/27/2021,1,Good news my partner says I erred.  Since the check was made payable to Provider B not to you you would not face penalties.   So I‚Äôm going to delete my earlier post.  But please track that down ASAP.
hmafuqw,Altruistic_Profile96,11/27/2021,1,I‚Äôm a big fan of Credit Unions as well.  USAA‚Äôs fraud unit is tops.  A few years ago I had $8500 taken from my checking account as somebody apparently cloned my Debit card.   I watched them via alerts as they drove from Miami to Lauderdale hitting a particular bank‚Äôs ATMs and a grocery store chain. The card was a chip and pin but the ATMs were mag stripe only.  I live nowhere near either city and only used my debit card at two Chip and Pin ATMs near me never for purchases.  USAA got it all back.
hmbjk98,AndThenThereWasOne0,11/27/2021,1,Do you get a tax rebate for doing this?

hmavi3d,wallpapersdance,11/27/2021,1,I unfortunately linked my marcus cds and also treasury direct to my bank of america savings account. Bank of america savings account has a 500$ minimum to avoid fees   I have 10k in series i bonds in treasury direct linked to that savings account. Jan 1st I will put in 10k more into that account.   Wont be able to go in person until maybe next fall for medallion signature to switch banks for treasury direct  Treasury direct requires an in person medallion signature I believe to switch the fund source to a different bank I believe? Am I just fucked I need to wait it all out and not be able to access the 500$ in that bank of america savings account?   Is there any other option I havent thought of?
hmbfgdm,Noticememarvelsenpai,11/27/2021,1,Not true. Its all going to depend on credit score and debt to income ratio.
hm8v3zf,darbronnoco,11/27/2021,41,I‚Äôll add to file the complaint in writing. Different rules apply in Banking for written vs verbal complaints.
hmb7rz6,alto-sun,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the response. It seems like I should sit down and ask myself some of these hard questions. Ive always had the mindset that the more I save the better. But I guess I dont know what Im saving for.
hmbakar,OperaticIguana,11/27/2021,1,200 kWh in a day is an average of 8333 W (24 hours a day). A typical space heater is about 1000-2000 W. So it does seem incredibly high. What kind of electric heat is it?  Surely it cant be a heat pump like this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ob8k2p/renter_with_obscene_electric_bill_lesson_learned/
hm9pjom,LuminousRaptor,11/27/2021,1,Respectfully I disagree that I didnt cover the personal side of personal finance in my reply to OP. The top post for several hours yesterday was pretty much lol your dad is stupid OP take the free money. which is categorically wrong if OP is paycheck to paycheck with only $1500 in a savings account.   The emergency fund is the key. If they have 3 to 4 months of expenses saved OP can fully contribute to their 401(k) while snowballing or avalanching his debt. The loans assuming their federal are in forbearance right now so if their loan servicer is anything like mine they wont have to make a payment for 3 more months which is time to take the company match and still build a 3 to 4k emergency fund.  Then OP can decide if they want to prioritize investments or loans. As evidenced by my post Im very much in favor of not putting extra against the loans if on average my investment return out perform what I save in interest. But you are right in that is their choice and OP should decide for themselves which to prioritize.
hmbj54y,Nexustar,11/27/2021,1,Leases usually have a buyout option... you sell the car and pay off the lease. Used car market is really good right now and a low mileage car should more than break even.  Even easier if hes trading it in to buy a cheaper new car.
hmba1z2,ronald_mcdonald_4prz,11/27/2021,1,Figure out what your NEEDS are. Sounds like $500/month. Give yourself a small entertainment budget. This will leave you with some money to pay off your debts.   However step 1 is to get an emergency fund. You need some money to fall back on if you need it.   Then pay off your debt aggressively
hmbcndk,sonibroc,11/27/2021,1,Your harsh question is a good one.  When we were young I asked my husband what he would by if he was single.  Now I ask that same question if he was widowed today.  Its the easiest mechanism to ensure that I hear what *he* wants instead anything adjustments he makes based on what he thinks/assume I want.  We have this conversation about once every 5-years to determine if we are happy with what we have or update what we have or move.  Tastes hobby and work changes its always a great conversation.
hmb977k,ronald_mcdonald_4prz,11/27/2021,1,Yeah don‚Äôt get a bike as your main mode of transportation if you‚Äôre not a seasoned rider

hm9qa5l,achieve_my_goals,11/27/2021,1,Thats obvious but OP may not have those options. Theres a lot of information they left out that would be helpful.
hm9x4je,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,We could match a Roth IRA but we couldnt match a 401(k).  Yes I know all about the HSA.  I had one for a year or so and maxed it out.  However we are currently TTC so I switched back to my husbands plan for both coverage and cost efficiency.   My companys HDHP was a. Incredibly expensive and b. had a $4000 deductible with a 8k OOPM.  I drool at these companies that have a $1500 deductible for a HDHP.

hmap7ws,Toodeveloped,11/27/2021,1,She directly told me that she is getting crushed by the job and has tried to look for work herself. She is scared of change but I‚Äôm not sure whether or not that is justified. I made a mistake on salary.
hmatws7,iranisculpable,11/27/2021,1,13 percent is below average.  With a credit score of 641 I would be concerned that any attempt to ask for a lower rate will instead trigger a hike.
hmas387,FutureBarrySeal,11/27/2021,1,So‚Ä¶. $100-$200 extra for a ‚Äúmuch nicer‚Äù home and you don‚Äôt know if having an extra $800 on top of your surplus vs $1000 aka $200/month for a ‚Äúmuch nicer‚Äù home is worth it? You‚Äôre also buying a house worth more that can be sold for more. I don‚Äôt see where the problem is? Unless you‚Äôre super frugal and want to retire as early as possible and save every penny it makes no sense not to. Higher earnings is meant to improve life within reason. There‚Äôs a difference spending that $1k on a really nice car that would depreciate quite a bit vs $200 on a house that‚Äôs inherently worth more and can be sold for more. Life style creep isn‚Äôt bad if kept in check. If you lived on a $30k salary and got Bumped to $60k it‚Äôs not bad to live on $40k. Get the nicer house. But not with a GF
hmbquka,lizgross144,11/27/2021,1,This is a terrible idea. Sounds like she doesn‚Äôt have the experience or ability to represent your interests well. This is a classics ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mix business and family‚Äù situation.   If your wife needs ideas of how to tell her you could say that if anything goes wrong in the transaction you don‚Äôt want to be in conflict with her.  Edit to add: we bought new construction (home was listed and construction was already well underway) and still used a realtor. I would do it that way again unless we were completely contracting a new build from scratch.
hm9qwhj,Kiole,11/27/2021,1,Does your closing cost estimate include title transfer real estate tax property tax prepayment insurance prepayment closing fees origination fees and buying the remaining fuel from seller? I was surprised at the amount of random taxes and money needed when I recently purchased.  I had a similar situation and opted for 5% down.
hmazbez,bkussow,11/27/2021,1,What region of Wisconsin are we talking? Us hunters like really any land. Although 5 acres isnt a lot. Otherwise try and sell it to the neighbors.
hmbgb5k,printerlampcomputer,11/27/2021,1,Lol funny comment not sure why people downvoted it. I mean I get they have different names in different states but still consistent with your joke anyone who is a fisher or hunter knows the names of the agencies they are hiding that extra or too small catch from.
hmbiu4n,OperaticIguana,11/27/2021,1,A general recommendation is to have no more than 20% of a portfolio in a single stock. The same rule should apply to your employers stock as well. So you should consider strategies to sell as much as possible and diversify.  This is likely a scenario where its worth talking to a CPA (certified public accountant) about how to minimize tax burden when diversifying.
hma5eam,rickybobinski,11/27/2021,1,Your car is totaled. The airbags alone will cost about as much as your car.  You need to have your car towed to a great body shop and let the other persons insurance handle. If they play around then lawyer up.
hmb8mae,SolutionLeading,11/27/2021,1,I‚Äôm not a financial advisor but here‚Äôs what I would do!  Step 1: save up $4000 in a savings account to cover you in case of an emergency. Based on my calculations this would cover your necessary expenses for a little over 4 months if you were to lose your job.  Step 2: Open a Roth IRA (or a 401K if your workplace offers one) and start contributing at least 15% of your income towards retirement.  Step 3: Save up anything left over for grad school and applying for scholarships to decrease the cost. Consider online grad school if possible to save money.
hma7k9r,flashgski,11/27/2021,1,Guarantee you will underestimate maintenance. Annual service on your heating system can be $200. Youll need to get yard care equipment which will need servicing if not electric. Repainting the house every few years plumbing issues etc.  It adds up and is not something you have to think about when renting. Id recommend putting aside another couple hundred a month for these things.
hm9rfze,OldGrady,11/27/2021,1,I was able to get a Signature Guarantee on form 5444 from Bank of American.  Don‚Äôt try for a medallion stamp they are much more difficult to obtain.
hmb6dwy,financial-jaguar,11/27/2021,1,Youre 50 so when do you plan on retiring?  Whats the growth on the investments? I assume its more than the rate on the mortgages. Id pay off neither if thats the extent of your liquid asserts (6 months + 200k).  For the investment property the mortgage allows you to write off the mortgage interest. It helps lower the tax burden of the property. For the primary residence even if youre taking the standard deduction the rate is low enough that you are better off letting your 200 k grow in the investment account. To simplify if youyour 200k is growing a 8% and the mortgage is at 3% youre still coming out ahead by 5%. On the other hand if you pay off the loan thats it. The most that money worked for you is that 3% interest you didnt have to pay... And youve lost the intangible of having a larger amount of liquid funds.
hmazd4r,MaddMikeG,11/27/2021,1,I don‚Äôt depend on the car to make money (like doing uber or anything like that) but i do 100% need it to get to work and also i have absolutely nowhere else to live.
hmafhwn,linuxtrek,11/27/2021,1,Dont do the RSA SecurID Device. I just did it and there are some transactions like forwarding a new card to your Canada address that requires the OTP from SMS. I am still stuck :(
hmbchhy,LLR1960,11/27/2021,1,And no sense buying/selling twice with the costs that go along with that if you dont have to.  Find a house thats big enough to stay in without being a monster house and youre set.  That assumes the bigger house is decently affordable.
hmapv27,ATLiensinyosockdraw,11/27/2021,1,It‚Äôs possible the car will not be drivable after the air bags blow. Many have safety features that immobilize them after an accident during which the airbags deploy.
hmapbv3,umrdyldo,11/27/2021,1,Just go onto Google and find the tax assessors map. Most counties are online now
hma79zv,FindFIREsomeday,11/27/2021,1,Thats also after your AGI (adjusted gross income) so that means take your gross pay and subtract your reg 401k contributions AND also subtract HSA contributions if you have one AND anything you pay for your health insurance premium.  Then subtract your standard deduction.  So if you make $90k and spend $200/mo on your Healthcare plan and save $800/ mo to your 401k then your taxable income is only $78k.  Then if youre single your standard deduction is $12550 (real number for 2021).  So your AGI or taxable income is $65450.  Now Im going to make pretend tax brackets:  Under $60k is 10% above $60k is 30%.  So youd be taxed: $6000 on the first $60k and  30% * $5450 = $1635 So your total taxes in my pretend tax system are: $6000+$1635= $7635  No where close to the $19k youd owe if every penny was taxed at 30%.
hmbajty,merlin401,11/27/2021,1,More likely result is being unhappy all your life and dying from something early-ish with a ton of money and no happy memories.  Saving everything to your own detriment isn‚Äôt eliminating risk it‚Äôs just choosing one risk over another
hmb4xj3,xhoi,11/27/2021,1,I wouldnt hold an emergency fund in any kind of investment account. It needs to be basically immediately accessible in order to cover you in tight situations.
hmba7nv,veloharris,11/27/2021,1,Odd Id say in this situation probably best to just roll it into an IRA or your own at this point.
hmaicut,kdavis37,11/27/2021,1,Whats your field for what its worth? Maybe someone here can help there?
hmag6g4,Woody1918,11/27/2021,1,Ha! No I don‚Äôt think I can change it.  But if I did have that much power first I would change a few other things about the job and second I would be making enough money to not even have to ask this question! üòÇüòÇ - ahhh the problems of the middle class
hm8uccl,NVPcMan,11/27/2021,-1,If you really want it in their name 1099 your kid 6k open Roth IRA for them and deposit all earnings file a 1040 for them?  Simplify the process and just invest in a brokerage account for them.
hma91r1,ThisIsAMonere,11/27/2021,1,It‚Äôs fine for you to believe this about marriage but as others have said what‚Äôs the plan for if you break up?  If you don‚Äôt plan on breaking up ever great! Sign some papers that say you‚Äôre married *solely* to protect the surviving partner in case one of you unexpectedly dies. You don‚Äôt even have to tell anyone and as someone who is married I assure you the process of getting the paperwork done to be legally married is a very boring bland experience that can feel like getting a drivers license renewed if you want it to. Weddings are outdated sure but marriage is a legal protection of your shared assets.  If you‚Äôre not yet sure you‚Äôre never going to break up then you must have a legal plan in place before you buy this house with your partner.
hmaubbg,Motobugs,11/27/2021,1,You havent paid yet. Wheres the rip off? Dont be too dramatic.
hm9lvsy,Danny0Shea,11/27/2021,3,OP being anxious about a big decision like this is totally normal even in your financial position. Youve done everything right and are prepared to buy a house but you need to get comfortable with the decision.  Ill just add quickly that dont feel like you need to buy youre at an age where flexibility is valuable. Opportunity at work in another city? Woman of your dreams lives in another state? If you can keep the cost of renting below your interest expense property tax insurance HOA fees and annual repairs and maintenance then renting can be a great deal.  If you buy keep all those expenses in mind in addition to the mortgage principal. Put as little down as you need to make your monthly budget comfortable. Your cash is better used in an emergency fund and invested rather than essentially earning your mortgage rate in the house.  If everything somehow goes wrong for a long period of time your worst case is living with your parents again. But for most Americans over a long period of time buying a house has been a net positive to their finances.
hmaxhh8,Interesting-Brief202,11/27/2021,1,You might be able to give/sell it to a neighbor or the states land conservation trust. Theres likely some endangered lizard or something there and the states wildlife preservation trust would take it off your hands. Might even get tax benefits out of the deal.
hma5wlq,Macluawn,11/27/2021,1,I also overlooked OPs employee only matches 50%. 401k matching also usually comes with gotchas e.g. have to work for the company at least N years. There‚Äôs an opportunity cost.   At worst his dad‚Äôs advice is irrelevant since the final numbers are close.
hmbgjtq,skiitifyoucan,11/27/2021,1,IMO spending more for the right house on the right neighborhood is probably worth it. Not moving for a long time is a good thing
hm9wts7,fabulousfred,11/27/2021,1,Is it worth a half million (plus) to you to stay 5 years?
hmad6y5,rtraveler1,11/27/2021,1,As long as your name is in the deed you are fine. You are also married so it will be a joint asset. $375k is not a lot in NJ. Maybe you can find a starter house. What county are you looking in?
hma566g,DiggingNoMore,11/27/2021,1,OP is 24 like it says at the top which you admit defeats your argument.
hma4c3g,Annonymouse100,11/27/2021,1,Yep you are just going to have to do the math based on your two potential properties using one as a rental and paying interesting on that amount of unrealized equity on your new home. Don‚Äôt forget the hassle of maintenance/ being a landlord (does you current home have large expenses coming up in the next 5-10 years?) and future capital gains on the eventual sale of the rental. No one is going to be able to give you a standard formula as there are to many variables based on the properties.   California also has a few base year transfer options for those over 55 disabled effected by natural disasters etc.
hm93nq6,DeluxeXL,11/27/2021,4,Whole years income is aggregated.

hmacx9i,Riza101z,11/27/2021,1,Ya I think fully combining finances makes more sense than keeping it separate and I feel like it would make managing finances easier.
hma7sd2,AndPlus,11/27/2021,1,Im invested in ESGV (Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF). Its done fairly well in the period I have owned it (less than a year). However when you look at the top 10 portfolio holdings you see that it resembles that of VOO VTI or VGT. So it makes sense that it is doing well when youre holding top performers of the SP500.   Be careful what is sold as ESG. Its a vague term. If it is truly your goal then you might have better luck with individual ESG-focused companies rather than buying a basket.
hmb388y,MrLodus,11/27/2021,1,Land will become more valuable the more humans that are on the planet. Sit on it pay taxes. You could sell it when its closer to development

hmaagg1,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,Being married is no different than cohabitating as far as expenses go.    Marriage just provides a orderly structure for dissolving the relationship along with some other legal benefits such as unlimited ability to transfer assets spousal privilege the ability to make end of life decisions for your partner etc.
hma30eb,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,> I thought it had to be taken out of paychecks.    401(k)s have to come out of paychecks but IRAs you can contribute to at-will but only up to as much as your earned income throughout the tax year. So if your earned income is $4k your IRA max contributions is $4k. If its $6k or higher your limit is $6k/yr....but you can 100% fund it in Jan as long as your earned income by year end is $6k or more.
hmaukux,youngsimba320,11/27/2021,1,Ok got it thanks
hma4l8u,meamemg,11/27/2021,1,It depends how out of balance it is. If just a little bit you can rebalance but just putting more of your money into the one that has lower value and less into the one that is too high.
hmb96mp,brimacki,11/27/2021,1,I dont have much help to offer on the root cause but if youre out of the house in the middle of the day you should just drop your temperature to the minimum amount needed to keep the pipes warm. I had the opposite problem in California (really high electric bill over the summer due to cooling the house) and when I shut off the unit during the day (when everyone was out of the house) the bill was cut in half.
hmas4no,JKiesewetterPhotos,11/27/2021,1,Awesome! Thanks so much for the advice!
hm999ku,okiechuckd,11/27/2021,1,Good point.

But I also don‚Äôt want this to bite me in the ass somehow.
hm9sol0,Ross11988,11/27/2021,2,Question is what‚Äôs your current expenses and how much do you need to live off of in retirement. Doing rough estimates it seems like based off the pension and retirement accounts you would have to live off of under 30K/year.
hm9c5bj,radwagonier,11/27/2021,1,Split decision. Say you sell one car and then you need a second car badly since the first one is broken down. You are in a fragile situation. Your cars aren‚Äôt overly expensive. I‚Äôd personally consider keeping them.

hm8v896,StiffHappens,11/27/2021,1,The bank has a record of whether the check was presented for payment. That means if the recipients bank requested payment. Normally that is looking at the image of the back of the check. If you used Chase Bill Pay they sent a paper check to the landlord. If the landlord PHYSICALLY deposited the check you should be able to get an image of the front and back of the check by finding it through the online activity search of your account.  If the landlord deposited the check using their mobile app or a desktop scanning device I dont know if there is a similar image constructed showing the deposit. However Chase does have a record somewhere of paying out the funds through the Federal Reserve to the landlords bank. If they cannot tell you and prove to you that the payment was completed ask them to return the funds to your account.   The primary method of YOU determining if the check was paid is to see where and when on your monthly statement the funds are shown as deducted from your account or as I mentioned above seeing and printing / downloading the image of the check in the online activity of your account.   If you dont get paper statements you can download a pdf from the Chase website. You can also filter all transactions for the amount of the rent payment or filter all payments to the landlord name and pdf that. Then email the pdf to your landlord showing that the payment was made. You can also go to a branch and have an officer do that then stamp it with their official stamp and initial it. Thats legal proof of payment being sent.  If Chase is unwilling to give you a certified record of the transaction tell them youll be complaining to the attorney general for your state AND to their primary regulator (possibly the OCC - Federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.) Youll have to look up the phone / email etc. for both of those.
hmaxgmr,invenio78,11/27/2021,1,There can be some financial risk.  For example if your spouse is sued they may now have access to their combined wealth and assets.  But overall getting married should not be a significant financial burden or benefit (presuming you dont go into debt to pay for some lavish wedding or something of that nature).
hmb1gbo,RonJohn223,11/27/2021,1,None that I can tell what-so-ever.  I would say it‚Äôs probably improved my score because I have to take a little more time to un-freeze and think about if I really need that credit.
hmak01j,kdavis37,11/27/2021,1,Two of my best friends are professional photographers. Both have found luck by being very specific in what they photograph. The one is a haunted house and RC car racing photographer. The other specifically does macro product photography. Both WILL do portraits weddings etc. but hate it.  The first actually worked for an architecture firm out of Atlanta for a while.  I wish that more art degrees (and arts degrees) included a bit of business with them.  As quickly as parts of Mexico are growing theres not any architecture work?  Are you in Mexico or the US since you mentioned immigration? I dont have contacts in Mexico but might be able to find something here
hmatrpm,BrockOli,11/27/2021,1,Thats great that they worked with you.   My argument isnt as strong as yours however my commute will be greater and I would have to pay to park my car ($18/day vs. $20/month currently). I aslo have some (~2 years experience) in the field.   Ill have to wait and see.

hmacgw4,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Regarding why it is in your name.   Reminder there are some folks who cash the check pocket the money and never get the damage fixed. Thats an OK thing to do.  Or maybe you take it somewhere cheaper and then pocket the difference.  The insurance reimbursed you for the value of the damage. You are under no requirement to actually go through with the repairs.  Anyway... They write the check to you so you can have control over all the above.

hmawqnv,TheQuaeritur,11/27/2021,1,Congratulations on your great job! Your plan and more importantly your desire to plan ahead are good.  A few things that come to mind :  Do you get health insurance through work? If not add it to your budget.   Do you have student loans or other debts?  If so prioritize paying these off.   And to avoid having a lot of disposable income without a goal every month which could lead to overspending  Id spread the $2000 between various sinking funds. The way it works you funnel cash (literally or on a spreadsheet) into various funds and you draw on the appropriate fund as needed. Sinking funds may include: shoes & clothes holiday break Christmas gifts electronics or large appliances giving property taxes... This builds expectation before spending  makes it more satisfying  forces you to plan ahead...
hm8vc8h,OnlyPostSoUsersXray,11/27/2021,2,For sure. My only thought was if its worth over complicating my upcoming tax situation even further for roughly 1 month of 401k. Thanks to this sub I now know its simply adding another line from my W2.  Gotta love PF.

hm9jpym,debtlady,11/27/2021,1,Yep thats what I did in regard the debt but the $40K earnings will only be for the initial six months after I graduate -- once I get a little experience at a more entry-level position I can then reasonably expect $55K rising to $75K over 3-5 years.   The long-term benefits will likely pay off but I do feel like a goon for getting myself into this stressful situation
hmbnd6e,Remarkable_Animal_18,11/27/2021,1,Heres what will happen. If you have too much credit available to you you then can become a liability and it will hurt your credit score more than help. More available credit doesnt = more credit score. Keep what you have and continue to pay off. Credit scores take time for a reason you cant  fast track this process all you can do is continue to be a good borrower and pay watch ur credit score grow.

hmanwl1,123456478965413846,11/27/2021,1,Only lawyer up if the other partys insurance fights you on paying AND you have injuries.  It is definitely not going to be worth paying for a lawyer to fight insurance over the payout on property damage alone on a car worth 4-6k.  And you will not be able to get a lawyer to take it on contingency without personal injuries so you will have to pay upfront.  You might not even be able to find a lawyer willing to take your case at all if it is just property damage.
hmayaqc,freya_246,11/27/2021,1,I would work one on one with her to fill out the applications then. That way she knows what your applying for not just out of no where.
hm9q2ei,roombataxi,11/27/2021,1,You have to look at your time horizon - how long until you want to have the money.  Over the long haul there are going to be significant ups and downs and you have to ride them out if you dont intend on using the money in the short term.  When you get closer to needing the money thats when you start transferring to a less risky / more safe investment like bonds or money market funds.   Think about your time horizon and that will let you know how much you should be considereing whether to move the money or not.
hm8ykb3,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,1,We will cash out on the rental when we move to TX to SC. The cost of living is cheaper there.   I see what you‚Äôre saying. After contributing to our retirement accounts I have about $4800 (sometimes more with quarterly  bonuses) a month to put towards savings and investments.   I calculate even if I contribute 3k a month to my Vangaurd brokerage account starting with the current point I‚Äôm at (50k) in 10 years I‚Äôll be at 660k. This is with an 8% return because I plan for the worst. The equity and cash flow from the homes in Austin for however long we keep them.  I‚Äôd be stoked to leave TX with $300k from equity in our properties. Just maybe getting greedy looking to upgrade to a DT more expensive property it sounds like‚Ä¶.  Why is what I was afraid of. A loan on a rental more than your primary residence even after putting 20% down is a little unsettling.
hmadci6,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Depends on the desired quality of life.    You too can retire today if you are OK living out on the street.  Maybe OP is moving back home to a developing country where the population survives on $1 a day. You would only need $17k to survive like that for the rest of your life.

hm9vx1t,0000GKP,11/27/2021,1,Think about why you wanted to leave. Decide if money is more important than that.
hmarxhh,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,As long as you pay (at minimum) the statement balance before the cutoff time of the due date is fine. This will avoid interest (on all but the most predatory of cards) and give you the paid on time mark.  &#x200B  You can pay for things as soon as they post (show on current balance) but that is unnecessary. Think back to the days of paying by check and mail and how annoying that would have been for everyone calling up every few days to check balance and sending out multiple checks each month.
hmaiag4,fawningandconning,11/27/2021,1,It makes no sense to pay it it literally can have 0 effect on your credit now and if you do pay it it can be put on your credit because youve reset the clock. Itd show as paid in full as a collection and can be reported for another 7 years.   Dont touch it or pay it.
hm9vbef,exconsultingguy,11/27/2021,1,You could pay $100/month for Visible (Verizon Prepaid) for all 4 of you or similar for T-Mobile postpaid.   I‚Äôd venture you‚Äôre paying upwards of $200/month right now with Verizon.
hm9q9vv,Jabrichmond,11/27/2021,1,A credit score around 600 is not going to get you ideal interest rates. If you‚Äôre not already I would join a credit union and talk about your options of opening a line of credit. They tend to have lower interest rates than a bank or online lenders

hmagpl9,Default87,11/27/2021,1,an emergency fund needs to be available as soon as today so a savings account is the only logical place to keep it.  your house downpayment will depend on when it is needed.  if you are buying a house in the near term (about 5 years or less) then a savings account makes sense.  if it will be a longer time until you buy then market investments would be an option.  also I would recommend you dont think of these two things as a combined $60k.  you have an emergency fund that is $X and a house downpayment fund that is $Y.  buying a house is not an emergency so you wouldnt use your emergency fund dollars to buy a house.
hmajqpl,RoastyMcGiblets,11/27/2021,1,Taking out a heloc beats a high-interest credit card. But these are not big items you are talking about. I would just save up the money for each thing and pay as you go.

hmazeh1,unbalancedcheckbook,11/27/2021,1,There are certain marriage penalties in the tax code so dont expect to save on taxes unless your income levels are wildly different.  Anyway dont do it or not do it for financial reasons. IMO  the main reason to get married (as opposed to just moving in together and agreeing to share everything) is that it legally codifies your relationship.  If youre legally in the grey zone between single and married things can be a lot more complicated when it comes to property ownership children medical authority etc.   That said Im not saying to rush in either... Just that the idea that you should be financially independent first is not really that relevant.   Sharing living expenses is a great thing to do financially however.   If you have one dwelling instead of two you will make a lot more headway in your financial goals.
hmb9nnd,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,Generally people are referring to gross income in the situation you describe. However when actually sitting down and writing out a budget you should consider your net income after taxes to make sure everything works.   I think the reason we speak in terms of gross income so often is that many personal finance decisions will impact your tax burden.   Eg. How much you allocate towards your 401k HSA IRA. Potential taxable investment events like selling part of your taxable portfolio. Roth IRA conversions etc..
hm9o8iz,RebeccaDSM,11/27/2021,4,There is no help with that  banks have their rules.  Also how do you know for sure his bank never received his money after you cancelled the dispute.  He could be conning you with that.
hmbapdl,lig710,11/27/2021,1,Unfortunately like others have said it sounds like time is the main factor here.  Based on what you‚Äôve said you are doing the right things but don‚Äôt have a ton on your credit history.  As for the large swing in your score could be inquiries on your credit causing that.  I recently had to apply to apartments and they did the standard inquiry on both my credit and my girlfriends.  I have multiple loan accounts related to my student loans 3 credit cards and a score around 740 with about 8 years of credit history at the time.  My score dropped a couple points from that inquiry.  My gf had a score around 800 but had never had any loans or credit cards thus her credit history didn‚Äôt have much there.  That inquiry temporarily dropped her score 40 points.

hm9003t,karlito1613,11/27/2021,2,Does your local new stations have a consumer division that may be able to help?
hm8y1er,BankEmoji,11/27/2021,296,Yes this is how it actually works. The lawyers will ask a bunch of predictable questions such as:  -	How long has this been going on? -	Have there been any other victims? -	Have these activities cross state lines? -	Are there other malicious insiders? -	Has this scam been successful? -	If so how much money involved? -	Are credit cards affected (PCI)?  If HR goes in and just fires the malicious actor right away the investigation could be seriously impacted.   Allowing a criminal to continue committing crimes under your watchful eye is the best way to both create the air tight case you need before referring the case to the USSS or FBI for LE intervention (which may be a requirement) but also to determine the scope and impact of the activities.   Scope would be things like ‚Äúhow many users were contacted how often did the scams work how many insiders are doing these things‚Äù.   Impact would be ‚ÄúHow many dollars are involved which government agencies must be notified will this have material impact on the brand/business‚Äù.   Watching a criminal commit crimes while you are collecting evidence is just the best.
hmacljs,Bert_Skrrtz,11/27/2021,1,You should aim for the 50/30/20 rule at a minimum.  We make better money but live in a very high/mid COL area and have managed to hit 50/20/30 (so more to savings than wants).  I‚Äôd recommend YNAB as well. It‚Äôs a total game changer when you stop spending money you don‚Äôt have yet.
hmaiipk,iheartnjdevils,11/27/2021,1,As mentioned several times on this thread when you set up autopay with chase the money is immediately deducted and a cashiers check is send to the recipient.

hm8wp22,assertivelyconfused,11/27/2021,1,I think you may have misread- his or her company only matches 50% up to 6%.  His or her fathers strategy only has him miss out on 1% free money or $520 per year.  Since his or her father presumably has access to the information we do not - interest rates living expenses vesting period 401k expenses 401k investment options - it‚Äôs hard to say that he or she should definitively contribute to 401k.     Post is not to disagree or present strawman argument just to clarify your post above as I am not sure the 50% match was factored into your rationale.
hmb8idr,arisaulrich,11/27/2021,1,Would it not be immediately accessible if held in a Roth IRA uninvested (basically a money market account)?

hmb62h8,NewlyMintedAdult,11/27/2021,1,Here are some approaches that may be worth trying.   * Think in terms of spending time rather than spending money. For example if you earn $20/hr picking up those fresh strawberries might be worth 15 minutes of work-time rather than $5. * Think about certain types of spending as investments. You arent just spending money - you are buying health or life satisfaction or experiences or what have you. * Decide on a threshold below which worrying about money doesnt make sense to you. Anytime you find yourself dealing with differences smaller than that threshold tell yourself that youve ALREADY decided not to worry about it. It doesnt matter if you could have gotten a better deal somewhere else or dont *really* need whatever the item in question is or whatever other doubts you make have - even if the doubts are correct youve already decided that the money in question isnt worth worrying about. * Go over your finances and decide on some amount of $/week that you would be comfortable spending on frivolities. Then if you are worried about whether a purchase is justified you can choose to pay for it from that budget and dont need to worry about justification that money was budget for literally whatever so you can spend it here guilt-free.

hmauq1c,NoodleDoodleGirl,11/27/2021,1,The old rule is you shouldn‚Äôt buy a house more than 3x what you earn but this is dependent on the your other debt and the taxes and cola in the area you are living. Without knowing your situation I would say $450k price based on your total income would put you in a position of being stretched too thin unable to continue to build savings and in a position of imminent default if you have an interruption in your income stream. This is coming from someone in the mortgage industry for 20+ years.

This would be the most profitable for you but again depends on a few factors.

hmb6bqs,ionlydrinkIPAs,11/27/2021,1,When people talk about a ‚Äúthick‚Äù credit file they aren‚Äôt just talking about the number of credit cards you have. They are also talking about the length of your credit history (which you can‚Äôt do anything about) and your credit mix. A good credit mix will come with time and includes credit cards student loans auto loans mortgages etc.   You‚Äôve already opened 4 new accounts of the exact same type in the last year or so. There really is no need to continue to open more CC accounts. You have a good score already and certain banks don‚Äôt like to see people opening a ton of accounts in a short period of time (e.g. Chase will automatically deny your CC application if you have more than 5 new accounts of any type within the last 24 months).

hma9lg7,Quirky-Ad-3400,11/27/2021,1,IMO There is nothing wrong with most target date funds. People don‚Äôt like them because they use bonds (typically a higher percentage the closer to the target date) but bonds can be useful as part of a diversified portfolio. The closer to retirement the less people can afford to wait for recovery and the less risk they should typically take. A target date fund attempts to do this automatically for you.  This site has many expert designed portfolios that you can consider if you want to be more hands on.

Cancel any subscriptions youre not using. Increase your income either working more hours or finding a different job that pays more. Sell stuff you own and down use anymore (clothes whatever). There are a lot of youtube channels on finance look it up and study a lot.
hm9mom5,decaturbob,11/27/2021,2, - depends on location.  - most people who comment on mobile homes have never lived in one or bought one/  - I bought a brand new one when I was in the USAF and owned it for 3 years and sold it for practically the same price I paid for it.  My cost of housing then boiled done to the lot rent and the utilities and I was way better off than all those who rented. My guess at the time. I spent less than 25% on OWNING and living in a mobile home than those who rented. The other 75% went into my pocket
hmb9n2q,FutureBarrySeal,11/27/2021,1,Only expensive if it fails. Generally more so for guys anyway. Being married has its financial benefits as well as dual income to go towards your financial goals.
hm9tbh3,Its-a-write-off,11/27/2021,1,50.00 for extra lines is high. Maybe you all need to shop a new plan together. But generally its better financially to all be on one plan.  A credit card is a better way to build credit.
hmaur2c,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,They probably dont have enough cash sitting in the branch safes. Some banks require 24 hours notice for cash requests of certain large sizes.  Its also possible he was just trying to help you. I would probably do the same. Young OP why do you want so much cash.... Wouldnt a cashier check be better? Having so much cash is risky to you and annoying for my branch.
hmb8evn,alto-sun,11/27/2021,1,Im afraid of something terrible happening (cancer natural disaster parent illness recession) and spiraling losing my emergency fund and really struggling. I have struggled with mental health in the past and as a result never feel like any job I have is secure even when it is on paper. So I feel like I need to stockpile money in preparation for the worst.   My parents pull in decent money (I think) but are also frugal and never spend it on for fun things. As a kid I was used to not asking for things and assuming what I got was all we could afford.
hm9wols,robertoblake2,11/27/2021,1,It‚Äôs more that if something were to happen to me I would want to know my siblings have the house üè° and don‚Äôt have to worry about that. I do have 2 life insurance policies and I‚Äôm looking at a policy in case I was only injured or incapacitated.  However I do also have some recurring passive income from SAAS maybe $5000 reliably per month from that regardless of ability to work.   Just tying to get as many perspectives and as much information as possible.  Didn‚Äôt expect to be in this position for a few more years.

hmaxum7,OhMyGodTheyKilledBri,11/27/2021,1,I‚Äôd disagree tbh. An emergency fund is intended for emergencies meaning they shouldn‚Äôt be needed but once every 2-3 years. The penalty for withdrawals from a 401k is 10%. The rough math says put the money in the retirement account and if you really absolutely need it pay the penalty. In most cases you can borrow it as a loan without paying the penalty. Unless you‚Äôre using emergency funds more than once a year you‚Äôre losing money watching it decay in a bank account. As far as the loan debts move from highest risk to lowest risk.
hma6ax7,_c4rli3,11/27/2021,1,Provider A told me they only did rollovers via check they wouldn‚Äôt give me the option for direct deposit. They said the check would be addressed to Provider B but they wouldn‚Äôt mail it directly to them they had to mail it to me or my company. I had it mailed to me and then went through HR because I‚Äôve never rolled over a 401k before and needed guidance on how to go about doing it. I feel like even if I was the one to mail the forms and check directly from my home they still would‚Äôve had trouble‚Ä¶ they seem extremely disorganized and it‚Äôs really frustrating.

hmb2kxe,Ok-Grapefruit-1072,11/27/2021,1,Being homeless sucks especially difficult if you want a shower and dont have access to one. Defiantly fix your car first because that is your home ticket to work and the only thing you have. If I might also give homeless advice sinks at laundromats are great places to bathe. In the cold weather find a 24 hour restaurant like Dennies and chill there for the night. I would hide a sleeping bag and sneak in the bathroom to sleep so you dont freeze to death in the car. In hot weather keep your deodorant and soaps in a plastic grocery bag and tie it to the handle outside your car while your not driving because the heat will melt them and stink up your car.
hmacl3k,Default87,11/27/2021,1,Its a waste of time and money that doesnt actually help achieve the stated goal.  if you really wanted to actually contribute to change invest normally and use some of those profits to support the cause.  Exxon doesnt care whether or not you are investing in them and not investing in them doesnt change their decision making.
hmau324,dleskov,11/27/2021,1,I would still argue that money on average can buy time. One can die prematurely in a car accident or otherwise but if they dont would not better quality of life and access to better medicine usually result in a longer lifespan? And money can certainly buy you free time.

hmbi5rb,Ok-Grapefruit-1072,11/27/2021,1,Its understandable to feel this way because you work so hard for your money basically trading hours of life for dollars and you dont want to spend it.
hmbdh9u,CQME,11/27/2021,1,I dont have experience with these but I understand the concept and what the super wealthy do with these kind of positions - they borrow off them and use loans to pay for things so that 1) they dont have to pay any capital gains tax and 2) they can still fully participate in their companys hopefully bright future.  In fact they could probably write off the interest if set up to do so and offset income.  Depending upon how much you have a wealth manager at a big bank could probably get you started or at least familiarized with how your situation works no commitment necessary for a consult.
hm93iji,SnooCauliflowers3903,11/27/2021,1,Do you guys typically use mutual funds or ETFs?
hma230t,silkysilkk,11/27/2021,1,I wouldnt worry too much about that. Having worked for a Honda dealership for a while these things happen way more than you think.   One of two things happened. 1. Honda Financial services have all these metrics in place that automatically flags any potential risks. 9 out of ten times all the dealership needs to do is rehash the deal(finance manager calls Honda financial services) and this will be resolved in less than two minutes. Since you said you were current before getting this new vehicle the system did the initial diagnosis and pushed it through but the secondary check pulled up your missed payment and the system rescinded the approval. This is merely optics  2. The dealership did not push your deal through but assumed you would be approved based on your history with Honda. This is a very common practice. They probably got a conditional approval from either Honda or another bank and they took that and ran with it. Sometimes these banks would come back and request additional information or more documents. I doubt that is your situation since you have history with Honda.  I wouldnt stress. The worst that could happen is that they may bump you down form Tier one rate to the next level down which might make your payment go up about $20. Honda values loyalty so as long as you are current with them they will push you through. Goodluck and enjoy that new vehicle.

But it‚Äôs the truth and it‚Äôs what most people think. ***  Check your school manual for rules and disciplinary action on plagiarism.  You usually have two options here:  1. Get ahead of it. Talk to the teacher or individual about the situation. Explain to them you were extremely busy with school work regular work and frustrated so you needed help.  Admit wrongdoing pout a bit and you have a 80% chance of just getting ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù and promising you won‚Äôt do it again.  2. Let them send your info let the chips fall where they may then deny deny deny. The school is not going to hire some lawyer to rummage through your bank transactions because of plagiarism.  * Remember schools need students. They care more about the government money you bring in to pay their fat salaries and sports teams.  I have never cheated on homework myself. But I have issued plenty of chargebacks!  * Bottom Line - If the product or service was not up to par chargeback.   Honestly I wish cars and homes had a chargeback policy. With the amount of surprises you find it would force buyers and sellers to make sure everything is fixed neat and tidy.   The guy didn‚Äôt do a good job with your homework anyway so you need your money back period. And don‚Äôt feel sorry. He should have done it correctly per your specifications in the first place.

hmbc4x4,frozeninjpthrowaway,11/27/2021,1,I would say what sets the first two apart is universality- my friend working in the UK doesnt have to worry if his bank supports Faster Payments or not they all just do. This is still an issue in the US with Zelle because its operated by a third party unconnected to the ACH operator and banks and credit unions have to apply to join with all the complexity that entails.  And the problem with Venmo and Paypal is that its only instant within the ecosystem- want your balance in your actual bank account? Youre beholden to ACH again.
hmaxthn,SolutionLeading,11/27/2021,1,I would just go with whatever works best for you and your life. You know that using 40% of your net income will put you in a tight position so maybe shooting for 20-30% of your net would make more sense for you. Personal finance is very personal and many of these guidelines don‚Äôt work for everyone :) good luck!

hmb8rl1,Delta080,11/27/2021,1,The only advice I can offer is that you should make credit card payments and payments for your bills immediately as you get your paycheck deposited. Set up automatic transfers so that way the money doesn‚Äôt stay in your bank account long.

hm9v94k,AmIRadBadOrJustSad,11/27/2021,1,Be worried when you need it in the next three years.  Aside from that try to retrain your thinking. The cost going down means youre getting your current contributions at a *discount* from what you would have paid. Index funds are great because they reflect a much more diversified approach than individual stock picks.  If you started buying at $100 and now it costs $50 unless you genuinely believe that the global economy is melting down forever then that $100 is going to come back eventually. And in the interim youre buying 2:1 with your money.  Im so much calmer with index accounts than investing in individual companies or crypto where you never know if youre getting out too early or too late.

hmabs7q,digitalhelix84,11/27/2021,1,Chase absolutely 100% can tell you of the check was cashed and provide proof.    If they say they cant email the CEO and tell them they say they cant.  The executive relations team will call you in a day or two and will actually research and solve your issue.  If you need the CEO email use Google Id give it to you here but was banned from another sub for sharing.    If it wasnt cashed ask them to put it back in your account and also show proof it was sent.  Share this with your landlord offer to pay and if they want to give you fees show them its their error.  If they still want to charge you fees Id probably complain to a local regulatory authority.  In my state id complain to the attorney general.
hmapw9h,spoonraker,11/27/2021,1,Thats not what DCA is either.  DCA just means taking investable funds you already have and intentionally spreading the investment out over a period of time. Thats it. It doesnt matter what you invest in what the price is or even what the period of time is or the number of installments DCA just means you have money to invest now but youre intentionally not putting it all in the market right away and instead are spreading the investment out over some period of time.  Imagine I gave you $1M right now to invest.  If you take that $1M and immediately invest it all thats a lump sum investment. Not DCA.  If you decided to invest 1/24th of it monthly over the next 2 years thats DCA.  If you decided to invest 1/12 of it monthly over the next year thats still DCA.  If you did 1/3 of it monthly over the next 3 months thats still DCA.  If you did half now and half in a year thats still DCA.  DCA just means you have the funds now but intentionally spread investing those funds over time.  Also its worth understanding that DCA is *not* an effective strategy for... basically anything.  DCA produces worse returns on average and it doesnt meaningfully reduce risk over the long term.  DCA does reduce risk *during the period of time in which youre investing* however that term should hopefully be relatively short compared to the overall time in the market. DCA either guarantees you miss out on a lot of time in the market or that you dont actually reduce risk much in the long run. This is why its not really good for anything.  Its also worth understanding that investing in multiple different index funds that are basically identical doesnt do much of anything either.  You seem a bit worried about risk so think of it like this:  1. Invest everything now dont wait waiting gains you nothing but 2. Reduce risk based on your risk tolerance by buying less risky funds with some percentage of your investable assets  Anything in the stock market is relatively risky even index funds. So if youre worried about the risk of index funds maybe buy some bonds in proportion with how much of that principal youre not willing to risk.  So for example: take 80% of your funds and dump it all into VTI right now then take the other 20% and dump it all into something like VBTLX right now.  That way youre not wasting your time playing mental tricks on yourself with DCA but youre still protecting 20% of your principal by investing in much less volatile assets. Hell hold some of it in cash if you want. Especially if you dont already have a sizable emergency fund.

hmb8pei,Nicedumplings,11/27/2021,1,As a land manager who is on the receiving end of wetland parcels like this I have a few words of advice.   Donate it to the local municipality or conservation agency (town/county/state). You‚Äôre allowed a tax write off of up to $5000 WITHOUT AN APPRAISAL for donation of property per the IRS.  You could see if there is anyone in the area that buys and sells land like this for hunting purposes or for development rights purposes etc. often times there may be underlying value in the land that the general public doesn‚Äôt know about. Maybe call your local municipality and see if they can give you information on the rights the land may have and their value. There are lots of people that will buy land off people like this for cheap and flip it for thousands more.   You can hold on to it. It‚Äôs $25/year and there‚Äôs the potential it could have higher value in the future. Maybe the state/town/county is buying up the land around it and yours will be a key piece.

hm9pl0t,nanaroo,11/27/2021,1,Are your parents in poor health?  Do you know if they have done any estate planning or have a will?  Late 50s is still fairly young and pre-retirement. Its entirely possible they have a plan of their own. Maybe you should approach them and ask them what their wishes are.  If theyve done estate planning theyll likely tell you. You. If they have not this could be a good conversation to get them thinking about it.   Doing anything else is sticking your nose where it doesnt belong.
hmbbnkz,jayhawk23ball,11/27/2021,1,Lot of people here talking about donating it to a land trust etc.etc. Im an attorney and trust officer/administrator for a corporate fiduciary. You really cant just donate the land unless the terms of the trust allow for you to. Typically you can either distribute out the land to the beneficiaries it stays in trust or you sell it. These things will require an appraisal if not already done.  It sounds like its going to be a pain and probably going to cost more than the land is worth but you really need to retain Wisconsin counsel and have them advise you as to what is allowable under the terms of the governing document.

hmbfoz1,throwaway43234235234,11/27/2021,1,Nuke the car loans and other debt asap and maintain your vehicles so they last and youre not swapping out unnecessarily when youre bored.Then try to max the other tax advantaged accounts. You can always lower them if you find it crippling but this is a nice way to put the squeeze on yourself in a good place if you feel like youre being wasteful. Crank that 401k % withholding up a pct or two beyond the employer match. Its still tax advantaged. It sounds like you already diversify so continue to contribute any leftover funds to brokerages etc.Lifestyle creep happens when youre wasteful with your money rather than smart.  Buy higher quality things that last instead of cheaper ones that break isnt creeping if they last and make your life better.  Plan a nice trip with a budget and feel like youve got a milestone or something out of it. Make it a semi-local one if you want to be thrifty but youve done well and earned the right to have some nice things. Just dont be ridiculous about it because youre not rich yet and itll go just as quick as you start realizing how enabling disposable income can be.  Is it creep if you splurge and spend a night out on the town every once in awhile to enjoy time with your friends/family? no. Doing it weekly without a budget? yes.  Depending how much to spend on house/projects you can always find yourself wishing for more.  Source: Bought a 300k house on 130k in income.Equivalent rental would be 1500-2500 atthe time now its 2500+. Rent keeps climbing.  Mortgage was 1700/mo tax/ins/escrow fixed for 30yrs (tax portion increases yearly)   \+ 500mo/ sewer/water/trash/elect/gas\~ utilities.   \+ 500/mo at least in seasonal projects/fixes/repairs/painting/etc.       (Add up all the projects and little parts and pieces you spent to get it done and then /12. You can save a lot here but also spent a ton real quick buying dumb stuff like trashcans and planters.

hma1lz1,wickedkittylitter,11/27/2021,1,Dont buy a house with a girlfriend.  Its messy when/if there is a breakup.  If you insist on going ahead with your plan use your first couple of months extra cash to pay a lawyer for a legal agreement detailing what happens to the house if there is a breakup.  You also need to specify how expenses will be handled while you live in the house.  Some points to include:  how maintenance costs will be split how any home improvement costs will be split how the monthly mortgage payment will be split who gets the house if you breakup a requirement that the loan be refinanced after the breakup within X amount of time or the house must be listed for sale at a reasonable price.  Your lawyer should have lots of other suggestions.  Its impossible to tell whether you should move into a higher price range because you havent listed any income or debt obligation information.  You also need to remember that houses come with more expenses than the mortgage payment.  Your utilities could be higher and more numerous than you are currently paying.  Youll need to buy lawn maintenance equipment and basic home maintenance equipment.  Youll need to occasionally replace/fix something like the water heater we had replaced last week.

Once the private loan is payed off put that minimum towards your student loans.

In this case Id say get some gig work like doordash and pay it off quick with a snowball.

hmb4cj1,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,Simply getting married isnt expensive just a nominal fee for the paperwork at the courthouse.  Getting divorced can certainly be expensive though. Many people change drastically in their early to mid-20s.  Its not a reason to avoid marriage necessarily but certainly a factor you should consider. Make sure youre ready to get married in general. Money religion children family involvement where you want to live conflict resolution etc... the list goes on and all of it is important in a marriage.   Id recommend pre-marital counseling and taking it seriously. There are paid services like traditional counseling but you can also run through question lists online. Good ole Reddit supplies a decent list in the thread linked below. Sit down individually and write out your answers slowly and thoughtfully over the course of a few weeks. Then come together and compare your answers.

hmabzla,badlero,11/27/2021,1,Yeah I agree the police could probably light a fire under the bank‚Äôs ass to provide the proof the check was cashed or say they screwed up.

hm9vuj9,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,The market closed higher yesterday than it did 6 weeks ago. Stop worrying about small dips.
hmah4jr,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,They dont need someone to pay off the entire loan in order to be profitable. They need them to just make interest payments for a short period of time.    Lets say someone takes out a $2000 loan from a scummy company. They pay $500 a month for 6 months. Most likely they have barely touched the principle.    Right about now the customer is catching on that they will never get out of this debt hole.    So the customer already paid them $3k of Interest on a $2k loan. The company has already made back its original $2k and made $1k of profit.  Customer can default now and they still made a profit.  They are predatory... They find desperate people and suck them dry just long enough to hit their profit goal.
hmbgzjl,jvdizzle,11/27/2021,1,Yes! I work in the ag and conservation space and word in the industry is that the federal government is looking to budget billions towards a carbon program. This could include money for land preservation.   Even if you arent interested in the grants someone else bigger than you may be willing to purchase that land to qualify for those grants.  Of course this is speculation. But OP mentioned $25/yr in property taxes so it wont really cost much to simply sit on it.
hma0h0k,jonsonmac,11/27/2021,1,It could be helpful with lower interest.  I personally took out a debt consolidation loan about ten years ago.  It helped in the short term but I didn‚Äôt change my spending habits.  My credit cards got maxed out once again and I filed for bankruptcy last year. I just wanted to chime in and say this: if you consolidate your credit card debt please do yourself a favor and cut up the credit cards or put them on ice.
hmb4a83,reyrey1332,11/27/2021,1,Are you serious about it growing in the bank???  Youre actually losing money when you count for inflation.
hmaxcyi,Ok-Grapefruit-1072,11/27/2021,1,Trust me you will never find a reliable car for 3k. Youll find one on Craigslist for that much but it will be old high milage and penny you to death for repairs. 10k is a good amount to spend on a car. Keep it for as long as you can.  This situation sucks I have the same problem but with student loans and medical bills & dental bills. How many hours a week do you work? What is your monthly income? You might benefit from working PT in retail or fast food around your doordash gig and dedicate that money to your debt without sacrificing your income but I cant say %100 because I dont fully know your situation.

hmbkqr0,baddad49,11/27/2021,1,probably not...at your age insurance rates are based primarily on your age...sucks but its true  you dont mention what kind of car but that does play into it a little bit sometimes...i.e.: muscle cars trucks and other flashy type vehicles will garner a higher premium  after 25 you should be able to get a lower rate if you continue to have a clean driving record and a modest car

hmaxiyw,nothlit,11/27/2021,1,You do not necessarily need to liquidate anything in order to do the transfer. Assets can be transferred in kind (without selling). However once the non-Vanguard funds are in your Vanguard account you may have to pay fees to sell them through Vanguard assuming you dont want to keep them forever. Check each fund here to see what transaction fees Vanguard charges if any: https://investor.vanguard.com/other-funds/

hmbjr3b,footballer2323,11/27/2021,1,Its divorce thats expensive.  If you are going to get married and *stay* married (everyone thinks they will) then marriage can be a big boost to your finances.  If you married too young or married in haste and reconsider then you will have to get divorced and that will be a financial disaster.  Dont get married unless you are *sure* this is what you want for the rest of your life.
hm9pqh6,unchinhairs,11/27/2021,1,If you dont have a 401k or similar employer plan you can deduct the entire amount of your contribution making it pre-tax.

hm9sc48,nothlit,11/27/2021,2,TreasuryDirect does not require that you have a relationship with the bank that stamps the form.  However good luck getting a bank to stamp it for you if you are not a customer of theirs.  This form is one of many reasons TreasuryDirect is a pain to work with.
hma9zpl,PriBake,11/27/2021,1,Just something to consider maybe now maybe in the future. Every time I get a raise I take about half of it and put it in my 401k so if I made a 4percent raise before I even see it I take 2percent and just add to my 401k that way I still get a raise but also still save without seeing it so I don‚Äôt miss it.
hmbldip,Stoic_Chief,11/27/2021,1,Youre right. Here is the excerpt form my current lease:  >A. Automatic Renewal.

hmafyji,FindFIREsomeday,11/27/2021,1,If my investments are worth 4x as much as my mortgage and growing I could sell investments if I experience job loss.  If the stock market craters and I lose my job there will be so much chaos and financial upheaval it will take a good long while to foreclose on me.  Also that 6 mo emergency fund ought to provide a little bit of breathing room dont you think? üòâ   Im pretty sure Ill be fine.
hma2hl7,Annonymouse100,11/27/2021,1,I know you didn‚Äôt ask this but you seem to feel trapped in this business and I think it‚Äôs worth taking a step back and looking at the overall picture.   Just because you are an owner does not mean you need to be an employee of the business. At 20k a year you are living in poverty and certainly not supporting a family. You have expressed a desire to get out of the business. Yes you have 70k in personal debt but there is a good chance that given supply chain shortages your equipment is also worth a good bit. You can always approach your business partner/brother with a buyout plan. Or put your foot down and remain an owner (with the liability of the debt and joint decision making) while working a job that is bringing in steady money. Throwing more hours at a business were every hour is losing money/unprofitable will dig you deeper into a hole and there is no reason in the current economy that a well run construction contractor would be losing money. And having one of you working the business instead of working for it is your best chance at turning it around.   The great thing is you have been living on 20k a year. Go get an 80-100k a year job doing structural metalwork for another company. You can pay off the debt (assuming the equipment isn‚Äôt liquidated to pay it off because your brother refuses to give up) in less then a year if you live on 20k. The best time to clean up a mess is now.
hmal1ye,el_rico_pavo_real,11/27/2021,1,So maybe I dont understand DCA. My plan for VTI is to simply buy once or twice per month and hold for 10+ years.
hmav9jv,KarlClausewitz,11/27/2021,1,Ask if they‚Äôll month-to-month lease. It likely will cost more in the short term but should allow you to find a new place and not lock you in for another year.

hmafsbu,ASDF0716,11/27/2021,1,Same.  I switched from BoA to PNC in 2011.  Nothing but good things.
hma9eiu,Cjkust,11/27/2021,1,I think what you think and what is happening are two different things. You have a balance now which shows me you are not good with credit cards. I would focus on fixing that before you go down getting another card with rewards.  Just my opinion you do you.
hmas7in,R0cketdevil,11/27/2021,1,Please consider this the land may not have much financial value today but wetlands are some of the most valuable carbon sinks in the northern hemisphere.   On top of that theyre an increasingly rare environment which makes them more important for biodiversity. Direct ownership of land is one of the most powerful tools for conservationists

hma2fqi,Pretty_Swordfish,11/27/2021,1,This at least put some of your raise into retirement especially if you arent maxing out your accounts yet. After that if you can carry the more expensive house on your own go for it. But keep in mind extra costs. My house mortgage payments are mandatory of $975 a month but total costs with all utilities ends up closer to $1800!! Houses are way more than just the mortgage.
hmadycz,OathOfFeanor,11/27/2021,1,Yep the ideal way this is handled without that tax is a rollover directly from one 401k to another.  That way they can verify that it is going into the proper type of retirement account for tax purposes so they are allowed to bypass withholding the taxes.
hmah1tk,kjblank80,11/27/2021,1,Which each raise I get the additional money that clears in my paycheck is diverted to a private investment account. This diversion is after 401k and other withdrawals.  In a way I havent had a raise at my current job for 6 years.  I just divert $1000 each paycheck into my private investment account.  This means my budget for weekly/monthly expenses havent changed.
hm8un2k,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,1,Would that mean maxing out the 401k/403B with no match?   I feel like putting everything into those accounts pulls away from our short term goals. I feel kind of uncomfortable having a majorly of my investments in retirement accounts that I can‚Äôt touch until I‚Äôm 59.5. I think what if my husband and I want just stop working at 39 and 43 but then can‚Äôt lol not sure how people divvy those investments up if they retire so young!
hmb9622,primarycare2b,11/27/2021,1,OP is a essentially working as a travel nurse. They make up to $10k/week but just chose to be cheap. Most physician residents only make $1000-$1500/week working double the hours. OP is not getting shafted
hmb545k,InteriorAttack,11/27/2021,1,you dont need to pay someone 1% to pick stocks for you they will under preform the market anyway. you also dont need someone to gamble your money on crypto either.
hm90bhv,DamnAlreadyTaken,11/27/2021,18,Because he already does have the information. And we/OP doesnt know how far would he go?    -Ask for money from client  -Next day hes out of a job.   **IF** bank teller is not lying and desperate for a hand out. He is now desperate and jobless. (and likely fucked to find another job).   ...whats next for Bank teller?  -- Not saying OP shouldnt report it but I would consider all those things as well. OP might need some steps in place to lookout for himself/his family before the next move. Some people out there are at the edge waiting for a push.
hmb3q4l,kalli007,11/27/2021,1,In our state Texas documenting the expenses has zero effect if you are married (or if someone is trying to prove you are) as it‚Äôs a community property state. A contract would absolutely be beneficial in this situation as the lack of written agreement has been used to imply common law marriage. Fortunately the bar is set pretty high in Texas courts since the addition of the third criteria in 1989 - but the vast majority of the common law suits brought in the state boil down to property disputes due to lack of written documentation/contract.  I don‚Äôt say all of this to be argumentative I say it having experienced it as a bystander and watching someone go through a six month long process costing thousands of dollars and wishing they had taken proactive steps to protect themselves in the beginning. People can get really shitty when they think they can get some money.
hmawiwo,fuzzythefridge1280,11/27/2021,1,Never been to the woods in northern WI have you.
hm9qx4k,roombataxi,11/27/2021,2,It seems like a fair split to save 1/2 and then spend 1/2.  That way youre pursuing two important goals at the same time.
hma83oz,DeluxeXL,11/27/2021,1,[Ubiquity](https://www.myubiquity.com/401k-resources/rolling-over-your-401k-follow-these-steps/) isnt a plan custodian. It uses Charles Schwab Matrix or TD Ameritrade to actually hold the funds. Thus you would have the rollover check payable to one of these.  401k is a complex machinery behind the scenes where administering holding paperworking/compliance can all be outsourced to different companies.

hmalsyr,_releaf_,11/27/2021,1,Thats good thats just investing. DCA means that the longer you do what youre doing the more beneficial your investment will be not just because youll have more money in the account but also because the cost to youve paid to buy your investment over the years will average out and be less volatile.  I think youre making it more complex than it needs to be! Just buy something that youre comfortable with and hold for as long as possible. Then keep doing that easy as pie!

hmawl9y,1hotjava,11/27/2021,1,Rarely does filing separately make sense. Ultimately we can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs too complicated and you really need to run the numbers both ways  What burns most people is that you two have to file either standard deduction or itemize you can‚Äôt file itemized and spouse file standard deduction. Plus tax rates are higher per person.
hmav4xt,Getmybaby,11/27/2021,1,They would have to re write the loan but many lenders will entertain your request because they know that they will lose your account to someone else if they dont work with you.
hmafdmb,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Did the agency say where your account went?   Did they close it out as settlement broke... Or perhaps accidentally closed as settlement paid?  Yes call GM.  See if GM will honor the original terms of the settlement and not make you start over with a new settlement.  You already reset your statue of limitations when you paid the first penny towards settlement. Not a big deal as long as you finish the settlement.
hm9tpn2,JKiesewetterPhotos,11/27/2021,1,Possibly...Might need to take a closer look at our Verizon plan and examine it a bit more closely.

hmaufnc,youngsimba320,11/27/2021,1,do you pay it off minutes after making the purchase or wait a few days for the balance to hit your account?
hmbr5un,Ok_Employee_9612,11/27/2021,1,You didn‚Äôt give people much to work with.  The simple answer is yes but like everyone else said if you don‚Äôt change the behavior it‚Äôs pointless.  I was you in my 20s and 30s.  Had a ton of CC debt paid it all off with a real estate transaction then found myself in the same situation 5 years later.  I finally said enough is enough got after my debt and focused on raising my income.  Now in my 40s I basically have a mortgage and that‚Äôs it.  Not sure how old you are but the sooner you make the change the better your older self will be.  I would call myself really good with money now but in my younger days I was a train-wreck!  My wife had to change too so you need to get your GF on board too.
hmau9gt,Withoutthe1,11/27/2021,1,There must be an alert on your account. Banks usually won‚Äôt do much about <10k unless there is reason to suspect possibly illegal activity.
hm9iikh,PersonalBrowser,11/27/2021,1,The Citi Custom Cash card is good since it gives you 5% on a specific category so you can use it to supplement your suite of other cards. For example if you eat at restaurants then having 5% back in restaurant purchases is pretty good if you were otherwise only getting 2-3% back for that category of spending.   That being said anybody that churns credit cards for points and benefits can tell you you aren‚Äôt supposed to carry a credit balance. And the fact that you‚Äôre primarily focused on getting 0% balance transfers and moving debt around and putting off repayment highlights that you are the perfect type of prey that these credit card companies are hunting for.   From this brief post it doesn‚Äôt look like you‚Äôre the type of person to responsibly use credit cards to be honest. I‚Äôd pay off all your balances and then use one credit card for all your purchases and pay the full balance off monthly.
hma9ojz,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,If you are not doing anything illegal you will be fine. The bank has to report these things so they can try to find the real bad guys. Nothing to worry about

If it‚Äôs a no to any of these you should NOT buy a house. Renting is perfectly fine while you save. You‚Äôre asking yourself if you get divorced are you protected when you really should be asking yourself with all the debt aren‚Äôt you liable?
hmayp48,mrisuckwithmoney,11/27/2021,1,At least ur bills are legitimate. I racked up all my bills from horrible decisions. Much easier to spend 12500 then pay it back. Doordash is a good job for me I just ended up in my spot because the last year I would spend and out everything on a credit card and just not work telling myself ‚Äú I will just doordash really hard for a month and pay it off‚Äù then the debt just keeps rising and I‚Äôm drowning :( I‚Äôm so ashamed of myself
hmax2v5,S1ren35,11/27/2021,1,Depends. Do you already have a savings account? First off would be to give yourself a few months expenses worth in savings. But youd definitely also want to drop as much as you can into that car note. Depending on your interest rate you can save a ton of money by paying it off early

hma0def,krustymeathead,11/27/2021,1,mortgages require usually 2 years of W2 forms or 1099 forms for contractors. so cash jobs wont help there. unless you can buy a house with no mortgage youll need an over the table job.
hmajsj6,3rdIQ,11/27/2021,1,Did you mean to ask Which fund?    There are thousands upon thousands of mutual funds and hundreds of brokerage companies that sell mutual funds. A mutual fund is not a silver bullet they are only one option investors have to choose from and their share price goes up and down with the market.  Investors have to have a comfort zone so they dont worry about their investments so they need to choose funds stocks ETFs etc very carefully to balance risk and safety because even good fund managers can have a bad year or the economy goes south or like we saw today a new COVID outbreak caused a dip in the market. But to answer your question here are three funds that have similar objectives and returns. They all have the same big tech companies making up 40% to 50% of their holdings.   APGYX  TRBCX  FBGRX
hma6v4a,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,> It would have been better for you to sign Provider B‚Äôs forms to allow a direct transfer of funds from A to B  You are describing a Direct Rollover.  There are a few ways Custodians can choose to execute Direct Rollovers.  One of those involves checks.  A check is issued from the Old Custodian that is payable to the New Custodian For Benefit Of (FBO) _c4rli3‚Äã.  This is a process that is not uncommonly encountered in the 401k/403b world.  OPs statement indicates that this was the method used.  >> check that would be addressed to the proper contact at Provider B.   Thus the 60 day rule does not apply in this case.  That rule is only for indirect rollovers where the check is made payable to _c4rli3.  > Why didn‚Äôt you send the check to Provider B yourself?  The process that OP has described is a normal one that can be expected from some HRs.  Some HRs have processes that require them to be the ones to submit/mail the rollover checks/forms to the custodian.  The problem here is not with the OP.
hmabif6,joeshmo39,11/27/2021,1,The non negotiable travel expense may well need to be negotiated but your budget needs a bigger makeover.  Where is your money going? Youre grossing 8k a month so maybe 5500 a month net. 2600 is essentials where is the other 3k going? A few hundred a month to travel but you have credit card debt so youre living outside your means. You need a line by line budget you need to pull and review your credit card and bank statements.   Youre also not in a good spot cash wise. 10k total liquid cash with a mortgage and maybe a kid is not nearly enough. Youre substantially behind on retirement unless theres a government pension in the mix and maybe even then.  Throw in daycare expenses or a parent leaving their job to stay home with baby and youre broke.  Sorry I know the advice on this thread has been positive but I view this as more precarious. Im 34 with young kids so do consider this perspective.

More than made up for by the people who pay in full. Theyre making their money from the near usurious level of interest they are charging people. In many cases over the life of the loan if you have a 16-20%+ interest rate youll pay about half of the principle in interest nearly doubling your cost of what you borrowed.
hmaa4ci,bassclarinetca,11/27/2021,1,Wow you Americans need to get interac e-transfer down there. It sounds like your banks are even more sleazy money grabbing bastards than ours!

hmaaw39,VoteyDisciple,11/27/2021,1,Take the best mortgage you can get. Who cares which partners are or arent on the mortgage!  The mortgage is a question of whos *paying* for the house. The deed is a question of who *owns* the house. My wife isnt on our mortgage so shes not technically responsible for paying the bill (a silly distinction without a difference since we have exclusively joint accounts) but she is still on the deed.  If you have separate finances and its going to matter who is actually paying the bill make sure you have a clear written understanding of that before signing with the bank. If your finances are combined then who gives a darn which name is on the banks paperwork.

hmatp8t,Scr0bD0b,11/27/2021,1,Coming from someone with zero risk or knowledge of her actual career maybe she should start saying No more often.  Managements lack of ability to staff properly shouldnt be her problem.  Once-in-awhile coverage is fine but long term is probably taking advantage of her.  If shes getting paid hourly and gets OT maybe its *more* worth it for her but...idk.
hma3brn,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,They match your Roth contribution amount. So if you contribute 10% of your pay into Roth and the matching is 100% up to 5% max they contribute 5% of your pay into your Traditional.
hma31gg,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,Yes for my employer its actually listed as safe harbor on my paycheck.   Yes the match is only for a traditional.  Im confused how can they match your Roth but not pay into your Roth?
hm9z3kj,FishnMagician,11/27/2021,1,It will still show it went to collections but would possibly be listed paid in full. Depends on the agreement
hmasoq4,Birdy_Cephon_Altera,11/27/2021,1,Because most people **do** pay them back.        Every lender makes loans based on various risk factors.  For a certain group of people they may calculate that only 1-2% of them will default on their loan so that group of people gets a great interest rate.  For another group of people they might default on their loans 10-15% of the time and that group gets a terrible rate.      Interest rate goes up the higher the risk.  For predatory lenders an extremely high percentage of them are at risk of defaulting on their loans (like 20% or even 30%) so the rates offered to that group are raised to offset the losses incurred from deadbeats.
hm9abir,bearjing,11/27/2021,2,Assuming the company match vests immediately it is still better to max out the 6%. Sucks to pay the penalty if he needs to withdraw but he will still end up with more money in the end.
hmb62fc,atx78701,11/27/2021,1,there is something called the rule of 72. Divide 72 by the interest rate and that is how many years it takes your money to double.  Historical returns are around 10% in the market so your money doubles every 7 years. At 25 and a retirement age of 65 you have around 5 doubles of any money you invest today. Every dollar you invest right now will be worth about 16X at 65.  If you save and invest 30% of your pretax income in the S&P 500 in about 25 years your money will be making as much as what you live on (about 50% of your pretax income).  If you dont want to do research just put your money into an S&P 500 index fund.  You do want about 6 months of expenses in cash in an emergency fund.
hmasw0n,kalli007,11/27/2021,1,Be mindful if you live in a state that recognizes common law marriage - because if you do this can definitely become an issue for litigation down the road. One of my close friends went through this nightmare a year ago arrangement was exactly as you described breakup after a decade and her ex filed divorce claiming common law marriage - attempting to be bought out of the house. Six months and $5k later it was tossed but it was an extremely stressful situation that could have been avoided.
hma8jfk,bbh42,11/27/2021,1,Get disciplined.  Your an adult so act like one.  Get on a written budget figure out where your money is going and cut out wasteful spending.  Shelter food and clothing are basic needs.  Utilities and the ability to get to work is next then everything else is probably a want that you need to cut.  Nobody needs to eat out take your lunch and learn to cook for example.    For years we still had a land line.  My wife and I always used our cell phones.  I finally canceled it and immediately found $115 to throw at debt.  When I realized what I had been wasting a year on a stupid landline I got mad.

hmadxx3,DasCapitolin,11/27/2021,1,Your expectations seem well underestimated to me. Unless you desire a very small home with limited yard space expect to pay more than $500K. In my city (Northern Nevada) the median home price is $575K.  Additionally I would never consider moving without already having gainful employment. $80K will be depleted by a home purchase so it wont be accessible for living off of. While you may want to live elsewhere you should resolve your income issues first.
hm96uqk,islangmemes,11/27/2021,1,I would say you could maybe swing it if you were very conservative with your money but with such little in savings I‚Äôd say no in this case. 10k in savings will not get you far at all. Barely will cover your furniture costs. You would literally be house poor if you have nothing else besides the 10k (I know you have retirement funds but you should never take those into consideration for non-retirement purposes). I personally wouldn‚Äôt want a high payment and zero cash in reserves if something major happens like you unexpectedly lose your job. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre eager to get into a place to call your own but don‚Äôt rush into it and make a decision you later regret. Keep saving that savings account and you‚Äôll be there soon enough.

hma91ty,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,We just paid off all of our credit card debt using a bonus my husband got from leaving his previous job in August. We were both credit card debt free in the beginning of October. So right now we only have our student loan debts since we dont have a mortgage under our name yet. Now were running small debts that we pay off immediately to build our credit. We are currently both above 700 because of it but the mortgage broker says he has to take the middle score I guess and mine is around a 660 or 670 because of some delinquency issues I fell into 5 years ago.

hm97d5x,Magnusg,11/27/2021,1,If your company provides a Roth 401k option it might be smart to contribute to that you usually still get the match into the 401k and the benefit of the Roth is that in an emergency you can actually pull out your contribution tax free (not the gains) because the money has been taxed already.    A Roth emergency fund is a good idea.

I recently received a 13% raise and before it became effective I raised my 401k contribution 10% which after my year end raise will have me maxing for 2022.  Do you have a Roth IRA? If not you can open one and put it 6k a year. This money will grow tax free and your contributions (not your gains) can be pulled out anytime to be used for anything. If after a couple years you want it for a house go for it. If you keep receiving raises and don‚Äôt need to touch that money even better!
hm9kup1,Morepaperplease,11/27/2021,1,Illinois is the state she lives in.  I called the police because I didn‚Äôt know who to call.  They put her in a mental health facility but she had been in a hospital before. You need social services and express that this person is not capable of taking care of themselves.  They will ask if you want to be responsible and I declined- as difficult a decision as that is. But seeing her washed and not living on a urine soaked couch and not eating or going outside - it‚Äôs better now. She can go outside every day she goes to eat with people with prepared healthy food they do the laundry and give her medical care when needed. They took all her assets but who cares when the basics aren‚Äôt there- I didn‚Äôt need her to have her house- she needed help.  I let all the money 14k her car and her house which was a giant disaster and behind on mortgage and taxes anyway.  She is better off. And she‚Äôs okay.  Edit. She was in a mental facility until they could find a spot in the nursing home -4 weeks.  FYI. That‚Äôs just a place that they use to assess to sort this out then to the best place for their abilities is used. They did consider assisted living apartment but the self care just wasn‚Äôt there.

hma5pwz,MHGLDNS,11/27/2021,1,If you aren‚Äôt disciplined enough to follow the Dave Ramsey plan then if you roll your CC debt into your house a year or two from now you‚Äôll have new CC debt AND owe more on your house.  A question to ask yourself is if you really want to pay for your past take-out pizza Amazon purchases etc for the next 30 years?     Also the best gift you can give your fianc√© is to get your financial house in order.  She needs to pay her own bills until you get married.
hm9joon,FN2187_JEDI,11/27/2021,1,I think if you read the wiki youll have a good the baseline of what we all recommend here. I agree do not share this with anyone. Keep it between us strangers here on PF. Remember just like they tell us to drink responsibly were allowed to enjoy life just the same. Do the things you love. Get a house youre comfortable paying. I dont think 400-500 is out of reach given you have no debt and can put a decent down payment (your choice of course) to manipulate your monthly payment. Best of luck to you.
hma14e6,WolverineTherapy,11/27/2021,1,Think of a mortgage like a necessary evil.  You have minimum payments sure.  You want to own the house outright as soon as possible though.  Its easier to pay off $250k than $280k.  If your payment is $1500 per month you should pay extra toward principal each month to own the house faster. Lower minimum payment leaves more cash for extra principal payments.  You also want to avoid keeping up with the Joness.  Who cares if the Joness hae quartz countertops and a sub zero freezer?  Do *you* want those things for *you*?  I would also caution you against buying a house with somebody not your spouse or business partner (in an LLC).

If you have any other significant debt (student loans car loans CC debt)...then no.  ETA: Most lenders will not want to see you paying every last penny you have saved on a downpayment either. This is a default risk when the house needs repair or an unexpected expense pops up.  > I also have a partner  Dont buy a house with someone youre not married to.

hm9zfwb,fullactualization,11/27/2021,1,Do you think you‚Äôll make more money in the future than you do today (I would hope so)? If so Roth IRA is the most logical option to choose - the money that is contributed into it will GROW and not get taxed far in the future at the (hopefully) much higher amount. I personally contribute up to the annual limit - I had sufficient amount of money outside of my paycheck so I was comfortable contributing 100% of my money earlier in the year and then scaling that down after I approached the limit (my employer keeps matching every paycheck as well) I wanted my money to be invested earlier and thus grow faster. It‚Äôs up to you how much you want to invest - how much do you have saved up and are you planning on any major expenses? (Eg. Buying a house? Medical expenses? Car? Children?). After you think through that decide on how much you think makes sense for you guys.

If youre not reasonably comfortable inspecting a car or fixing it yourself you may find yourself in a pickle going that route.
hm9hhwt,UserName4lreadyTak3n,11/27/2021,2,Depends on the virus that you think you have. Head over to r/privacy r/privacytools and have a look in their FAQ/About and stickies threads for anti-virus guidance.   If your concern is that is has read/accessed your saved credit card details then sure get them re-issued. You‚Äôre on a sub that debates  retirement plans and money management not cyber security. Getting new cards issued is free so no harm done if you do.

hmb4nm4,iamedreed,11/27/2021,1,find the payroll manager and email them directly (I assume you have a company directory or some way to search names and emails?) if that doesnt work find the controller if that doesnt work CHRO/CFO.  what is your manager doing to help you? if this happened to one of my employees I would be doing all of the above for them.

hmavc2k,x_driven_x,11/27/2021,1,Im a software solution architect at the moment so STEM / good salary which helps significantly.   Im also trying to get some side hustle websites going that will bring in some mostly passive income as well to contribute as I plan to leave traditional work later. I have 1 making revenue pre-covid was just getting up to $3000 profit a month but now I sometimes pay myself $300... hopefully it will grow again. Ive started on a second that is more of a hobby but has potential to general small revenue later.  Ideally these sorts of ideas bring me anywhere from $3000 - $10000 a month later.  Doing a lot of sailing stuff as a hobby and will to the point I could get a captains license in case I want to work a bit / charter my own eventual boat out etc... and if not  I enjoy it anyway!
hm9xh39,strsystem,11/27/2021,1,Even if you have a good relationship with them I think your dad telling you to get your savings up is a signal to try not to rely on them. Haha.
hma547u,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,You mention you have $67k net after deductions....whats your taxable income? Im guessing youre below the top of the 12% bracket ($83550 for married filing jointly)?    Traditional vs roth is a funny thing roth sounds great - and as long as they dont change the rules on them before you reach retirement they can help protect you from other tax changes in/before retirement but generally speaking traditional is better for *most* income levels.    Look at it this way with todays brackets you have to make more than $109450 to pay more than 12% tax as married filing jointly (this is the top of the 12% + standard deduction). So even if you defer tax (use traditional 401k) you have to withdraw more than $109450 *while in retirement* to be taxed higher than your contributions are being taxed today.    However theres more than that....when you contribute to a retirement account those dollars come off the top. Youre comfortably in the 12% bracket which means every dollar you contribute is taxed at 12% (if Roth) or deferred (if Traditional). When you withdraw money in retirement the first $25900 is tax free (standard deduction) then the next $20550 is taxed at 10% only. Only after that do you start paying 12%.    So even with say $85k gross income married filing jointly all your contributions can be deferred via Traditional contributions and you pay *less than* 12% tax on all withdrawals up to $46450 per year. Only then (for the next $39k you withdraw to hit that $85k number I said first) do you start to pay 12% tax which is the same as you wouldve paid if you used Roth from the beginning.    tldr - Having a mix of both is best for maximum flexibility but as far as paying taxes go Traditional will most likely be better for you *on average* unless you plan to have $150k+ in retirement income or so. So yes Roth IRA + 401k is too heavy on Roth IMHO....go with Traditional 401k to get a 12% tax break now (and keep maxing the Roth IRA) and barring significant tax reforms (it could totally happen but cant be predicted this far out) youll be better off in retirement.

hmayncq,HolyGig,11/27/2021,1,Yeah but you are just buying time you already have a finite quantity of. Take advantage and enjoy life while you are still young dont skip on going out with friends and family or taking a vacation here or there or ignoring your hobbies just to put a few more bucks towards your retirement.  Most people I talk to who plan to retire early plan to do so with a very frugal lifestyle. Man whats the point of having all that time if you have no money to enjoy it with?

hm9d6p0,aliwalas,11/27/2021,1,My tip know your why.   Think about why you want the money in the first place? Financial freedom sure so why is that important? To retire early ok but then to do what? What do you envision yourself do if you do retire early? What do you envision yourself do with all the money you accumulate?  I mean dont answer me but just food for thought. Know your why because when you do make that mistake as you will its what life is all about then you wouldnt regret your decision... Or at least not as much lol.

hmb6xbx,RO489,11/27/2021,1,Good luck! The marriage rate is declining so we need to adapt advice to adjust for the fact that more people will be entering into financial partnerships before or outside marriage. Instead of dont do it I think do it wisely makes more sense. My personal experience is my bf at the time (now husband) had the mortgage in his name and we divided expenses by income. Once we were married it became joint property.  Regarding money you cant take it with you. Im not trying to build generational wealth or retire at 40 so for me its a balance between a well funded retirement and enjoying the life I have now.  For what is worth at your new income that 401k tax benefit is going to be even sweeter (as will the mortgage interest deduction).

hm8vyy9,Tony_M13,11/27/2021,1,I dont but they are still common. The worst is that when you want to rent an appartment in a big rental complex in my area they only accept money orders for the first payment (so you have to go to grocery store or a place like western union and give them cash (or debit card) and they will give you a piece of paper that works like a check but less secure. And those have low limits so you need 2 or 3 of them for that payment and they charge you a small amount for each of them.

hma1x2i,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,Thank you. I appreciate your response! I had kids while I was a married SAHM to someone earning $80000. He became physically abusive (in other ways too) and nearly killed me one night. That was the last straw and we separated soon after that. (Yes I should have left him much sooner.) He was highly opposed to me working (He wanted me to be completely dependent on him just to control me.) and I will always regret that I didnt pursue my Masters degree or other educational/career paths earlier.   I agree that I need more income but how? I just spent two hours this morning searching entry level jobs on Indeed. Probably 90% of the jobs I saw pay as much as what I currently make teaching preschool. Others like recruiting engineering banking etc. pay more but I dont think I would get hired for any of them because I literally have no qualifications experience or interest in those jobs. I did see something about becoming a behavior counselor for kids with autism and they seem to want people in the evenings so maybe I can try that as a second job but childcare is an issue.   Also one of the major reasons I teach preschool is because this school gives me an enormous childcare discount to bring my own kids with me. In the past I worked in a public school but then my childcare expenses were triple what they are now (and I would not have qualified for any assistance) and I was basically in the exact same boat. In addition this preschool transports my children to their elementary schools which would be almost impossible for me to do myself if I had another job. And I dont have any friends or family who can help me with babysitting or transportation. My kids arent old enough to stay home by themselves.   Im working on a Masters degree in education. Where I currently live Ill start out earning $76000 once I graduate and the salary increases by about $2000 - $3000 per year after that. Is it the best path? Im not certain but considering that I have NO other experience besides teaching and caring for kids...it seems like the best way forward for now. I have considered trying to get some IT certifications in the future as another career.

hm903dm,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,I dont think its too much. Personally Id probably increase it a little bit if I was in your shoes. I have the same thought of just wanting to save more and more though (also 29). I figure front weighting my retirement savings is a lot less stressful than playing catch up.   That said its a reasonable amount and if youre happy with life meeting other saving goals and comfortable with retirement projections at the current rate.... just keep on chugging.
hman7ka,doktorhladnjak,11/27/2021,1,Very true. At least you can live in a house. It has utility beyond its monetary value.   I can‚Äôt find it right now but there‚Äôs an interesting paper about house prices on the Herrengracht in Amsterdam. This has been a prime real estate location continuously for over 400 years.   The authors found that over these very long timeframes real estate more or less matches inflation.   However they also found prices go in waves on long 50-100 year timeframes and short timeframes. Basically over 10 years prices may go up or down in a cycle (like the downtrend we saw around 2009 or many up trends) but across a 50-100 year window prices will consistently be above or below inflation.  We‚Äôve been in a ‚Äúbeats inflation‚Äù mode for several decades in the US but this will probably eventually change to a ‚Äútrails inflation‚Äù mode that will last several decades. This is likely connected to human psychology of a couple generations believing real estate is a good investment or just a place to live.

Every now and again (like 1 in 5000 deals) the dealership guesses wrong and isnt able to get it approved at all after letting the car out. In my state at least (Maine) the customer should have been notified that the deal wasnt approved yet but Im familiar with every state so it is possible that you wouldnt know.

hm999sr,roombataxi,11/27/2021,2,Assuming car prices are 10-20% overpriced then youre looking at an extra 2000-4000 youre paying that you wouldnt otherwise pay.  So for your $20K you spend youll be getting $16K worth of vehicle.  Its not ideal but it will get the job done for what you need. Shop hard for a good deal but get it done so you can have wheels when you need them.
hmaks9c,_releaf_,11/27/2021,1,Dollar cost averaging is a byproduct of continually investing it should not be the foundation of your investments. Decide on which type of investing youd like your risk tolerance and just continue to invest into that strategy. No sense in making things too complicated!
hma6z7t,wickedkittylitter,11/27/2021,1,Time is your friend...and a budget.  Set budgeted amounts for every expense category included an entertainment/fun expense category.  Start your budget by figuring how much you want to save every month then set the other categories by how much youve been spending on rent/utilities/food/etc.  As each month passes and you realize that you are able to meet your savings goals and still cover all your budgeted expenses your anxiety should decrease.  If it doesnt a few sessions with a therapist might be needed.
hmbilpl,sciguyCO,11/27/2021,1,As long as you are not also covered by a non-HDHP plan and not claimed as a dependent on your parents‚Äô taxes then you can have and contribute to your own personal HSA. And since you‚Äôre in a family plan you get to use the higher $7200 per year contribution limit independent and separate from however much your dad contributes.
hma1iet,Dignam3,11/27/2021,1,Sounds like he wants you to have an emergency fund first which is good.  But IMO you are leaving free money by not contributing up to max match.  Note the following is not ideal: but you \*can\* use your 401k (vesting dependent of course) for an emergency until your more liquid cash fund is big enough.  You will pay a early withdrawal penalty but you can do it if absolutely necessary.  I dont think your dad is wrong necessarily but if it were me I would most definitely contribute 6% first then focus on e-fund and loans.
hmajw1r,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Zombie debt!   If you pay a penny it will reset the statute of limitations could bring it back onto your report and could open you up for new lawsuits.  Dont give them a penny.

hmaptdg,AlphaCurrency,11/27/2021,1,Being on the mortgage doesnt matter. That just liability for the loan. You need yo be on the DEED to the house to have partial ownership.  Also if they allow use and  or incase of death because they will make you pay if its just and( its evil and stupid) example - john doe and or jane joe. Cus if john dies john  Doe and jane doe no longer exist and they will make you pay more and jump hoops for your house to get it in just your name. (From experience) That or makes a huge diff.

hmaoqpb,Peelboy,11/27/2021,1,Yes you can and actually they should send it back.  My wife just had surgery and paid $1500 too much and we just got the check back last week.  Talk to their billing to let them know you know and things should start to happen.  If they dont start to dig and if you live in the US talk to your insurance and let them know what is going on.  We had a doctor that was double billing our daughter and my wife called up the insurance and they stopped paying out to that medical office and they fixed the issue real quick when the money stopped.coming from every patient with that insurance.
hm9746z,vgacolor,11/27/2021,5,For everyone else. Learn this lesson from OP. Employers have their payroll online and once you leave their job access is cut off. Before you give notice go in there and download the last paystub.  It might not be complete since you are probably going to get one more but it will give you an idea and help you reconcile.    Do this in case they let you go immediately if you give notice. And if they dont let you go and you have access until the real last payment is made then download the updated one.
hmacb7j,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,Ive heard putting down 20% isnt as common in this economy anymore and that (with a conventional loan at least) its just a matter of accepting that you have to pay PMI toward the loan until you reach that 20%. We know a fair amount of people who have bought houses with less because in New Jersey at least 20% usually means 50 to 90k from what Ive been able to tell by researching houses in the areas around us. We are both first time buyers so I know I dont know everything. We are going to be putting the money from selling this house toward the mortgage. Our original plan had been to rent between selling and buying to be able to use the money from selling as a down payment but when we looked into renting after being asked to start house hunting the rent wed be paying for much less space was more than wed be paying for a mortgage because we have animals. We cant move out of New Jersey for family and job related reasons and we dont have 20% saved up but its also not as if buying a house will break us.  My main concern isnt so much the down payment. Weve come to terms with having to pay PMI. But my concern is/was whether or not I should be included in the mortgage. Id love to be debt free. Right now were both credit card debt free. But Im not paying off 90k worth of student loan debt anytime soon and we need to move.
hmag7le,FindFIREsomeday,11/27/2021,1,Ooooh youve now ventured into territory where I dont care enough to have an opinion. Im sure either is fine.

hmb35ld,frzn_dad,11/27/2021,1,Will that still be true for both of you as you start college. If one of you has a college fund or scholarships and the other doesnt there is about to be some lopsided debt.
hm8zbe9,LookAroundAndViewIt,11/27/2021,1,If you are sure this is the place for you then go for it. If you don‚Äôt love everything about this place don‚Äôt do it for the FOMO.  It sounds like you have enough money and discipline to make it work. There is some more money coming in (raise/bonus/renter) that may help build up a bigger emergency fund for things that can go wrong when you own.  Maxing your 401k is great but if you cut back to contributing 10k a year for a few years and get to live where you want for the next 20 years will you be happier?
hma3hwh,HemingwayHuxley,11/27/2021,1,Yeah like I said there were some poor financial decisions that had led to the poor savings. My wife works for the govt and her coworker didnt pay anything out of pocket for medical expenses when she gave birth. I also shouldve mentioned $7000 in HSA. Im trying to fix the savings. What is a realistic monthly amount to save in our situation assuming that weve trimmed the monthly budget reasonably well ourselves?
hmayswh,codemonkey14,11/27/2021,1,I was literally in the same situation as you a few years ago almost down to the exact numbers.    My advice: prioritize what is a lifestyle improvement you consider worth the money and also take a fixed % of each major income raise you have and use it as your increased savings and use the other for lifestyle enhancements.    For example let‚Äôs say you agree on a fixed 50% saving rate of any new income going forward from your previous income level. If you start taking home an extra $1000/mo put $500 of it towards savings and use $500 toward stuff that makes your life better (mortgage on a nicer house vacations eating out new gadgets etc). This in my experience has led to the most amount of having savings keep up with new income while still being able to enjoy the success I‚Äôve had and not waste my life living without the things that I dreamed about when I wasn‚Äôt earning as much money as I am.
hmbh0ab,Yakb0,11/27/2021,1,The nice house will still be there in a few years it will just have an extra $200000 added to the price tag.

hmawat8,Breakfasttimer,11/27/2021,1,I want to echo the others here and say that budgeting software can be very helpful in keeping track of your money.  You don‚Äôt necessarily need it to limit or regulate your spending but having a full picture of how you spend and how much money you have available can ease the anxiety.
hmahatg,Calm_Cod_5266,11/27/2021,1,Right from what I can tell many ESG index funds are similar to market ETFs but just screen out oil and gas companies. Which I guess is good that it still tracks the market but doesn‚Äôt support a few companies that are bad for the environment. Doesn‚Äôt do much outside of that it appears. They do have ones with stricter guidelines but they are smaller funds with less history.   I do feel motivated to allocation at least a portion of my portfolio to ESG but trying to figure out the right mix. Thanks for sharing.

hm9haz6,trollreign,11/27/2021,1,He is giving you excellent advice! Your first step should be creating an emergency fund of a couple grand then getting rid of the student loan debt. Then you can start saving for a house and retirement. Your student loan debt and lack of savings is holding you back a lot more than your money saved for retirement puts you ahead.
hmau8ei,veloharris,11/27/2021,1,Why are you involving HR? You can do this directly with your 401k provider many providers have an app that allows you to deposit by taking a picture of the check.

hmaatm7,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,Theres a misperception that the courts can decide who gets the tax break (deduction) for a child (or children).   The IRS doesnt care what the court says. Do your own research (can start with below link) and consider confirming with a short consult with a fee-only professional. Generally the parent who has custody more than 50% of the time is allowed to claim the child as dependent.    Also filing first matters in that if you file first your refund will be processed. Should he file a return later using the same (childs) SSN as a dependent that will trigger a review before issuing the second credit.  Finally if you are getting that much of a refund stop loaning the government your money interest free adjust your withholding (if you havent already).

hmafnbe,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,Houses come with a hidden liability: maintenance. You need to have an emergency fund that can cover an unexpected major expense or risk losing the house.    Thats on top of 3-6 months living expense.   If you dont have this make that your goal. How you do it is flexible. Can be any of/combination of: more work use more student loans roommate.   Being a landlord is a job you have all the liability in covering expenses (even more so it is a contractual obligation to maintain the habitability of the house) so if you dont already have experience with this and dont have guidance from family who have done this its risky.

I know so many American families living in $500k+ houses driving $70k cars and always being fucking broke at the end of the month. If a sudden minor bill pops up they go into serious stress-mode

hm9oa4c,trollreign,11/27/2021,1,Extremely bad advice in my opinion. Personal finance is not a math problem. It‚Äôs 80% personal and 20% finance at best. Life will mess with you you lose your job or you get a divorce or you lose your parents etc. Shit happens.  It‚Äôs way better to set up an emergency fund and get rid of student loans first then you can start saving for retirement and investing. Financial stability is the basis of both a satisfying life without worrying and building wealth.  You need to be stable in the present before you can work on making your future stable
hmad8gq,Earthquake14,11/27/2021,1,Fianc√© and I are both 25. I‚Äôve had a slower start since I‚Äôm not a US citizen (scheduled to become a permanent legal resident summer 2022) and had a lot of restrictions with the types of accounts I can open but on the other hand I have no college debt so it balances out.
hmas9my,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,> But isnt the beauty of a Roth is that all earnings are tax deferred too.    Earnings are tax-free with Roth not tax-deferred....traditional = tax-deferred earnings.    That said the benefit stays the same as I mentioned because when you contribute with Traditional (instead of Roth) you can afford to contribute 12% *more* (assuming your tax bracket is 12%). That higher contribution means your money grows as a higher rate. So not only does Traditional = higher balance but the tax implications are still equal (in my example) *at worst*.    For example lets say you can afford to contribute $1000 and it grows at 7% for 30 years (somewhat conservative adjustment for inflation).    * Roth: $1000 contributed because its post-tax = $1000 less dollars in your pocket after 30 years @ 7% = $7.612.26   * Traditional: $1136.36 contributed pre-tax = $1000 less dollars in your pocket (if you didnt contribute this $1136.36 you would be taxed at 12% and only bring home $1000) after 30 years @ 7% = $8650.26    In both situations your net pay is $1000 lower than if you didnt contribute at all. With Roth you pay $0 tax so you have $7612.26. With Traditional you pay 12% (assuming the previous hypothetical situation). $8650.26 - $1038.03 (12%) = $7612.23 (the $0.03 difference is from rounding errors as I rounded to the nearest cent for each figure).    So even though Roth grew tax-free and traditional was only tax-deferred you **still** end up with the same amount if youre being taxed at the same amount...doesnt matter if youre taxed now or later.    But heres the thing if that $8650.26 was withdrawn as part of your standard deduction your tax-deferred growth in the traditional account is taxed at 0% which means your contribution to traditional came out to a *larger* number than it wouldve in Roth **and** cost you less in taxes.    tldr - If your highest tax bracket *during retirement* is equal or less than your current tax bracket Traditional will **always** be identical *or better* than Roth regardless of tax-free vs tax-deferred. The only time Roth is better is if the amount you withdraw during retirement from traditional accounts pushes you to the **top** of your marginal bracket *during contribution*.

hm9zpxv,ASHAKANTASHARMA,11/27/2021,1,It depends on the priorities and medium and long term goals and plans of your life.
hm9aglc,radwagonier,11/27/2021,3,I‚Äôm guessing a 401k or traditional IRA or even a taxable brokerage account would be superior to a Roth IRA.   Choosing Roth means you believe she may be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. I‚Äôm going to say at this point that‚Äôs impossible.   Increasing 401k contributions or investing in a traditional IRA would give her tax savings now which she could use to save more.   She likely will pay no taxes in retirement no matter what she does now.   The zero long term capital gains bracket also roughly overlays the 12% federal income bracket. So taxable investments are on the table also - tax free!  Roth is a bad choice in my opinion. You are locking in the highest tax rate of her life.   In terms of asset allocation I‚Äôd stick with a target date fund or a ‚Äúlife strategy‚Äù fund.  If she can save ~150k before she retires that‚Äôs $500/mo at a 5% withdrawal rate.
hmah973,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,Theres a book called Lifecycle Investing that is tangentially related to this. They show that by investing heavily early on you get a diversification benefit due to diversifying your exposure to the market over time. This makes your outcome more reliable and raises the lower bounds for what youll end up with.   Projecting 5/6/7 percent might be too optimistic. Were you projecting that 1.7M in todays dollars or adjusted for inflation? Global stocks returned around 5.2% adjusted for inflation since 1900. Presumably youll be adding bonds in at some point which will reduce returns at a time when you have the most invested. Further 5.2 is an average and there were many 20 periods where real returns were worse.

hmae28i,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,15k in savings on 1M worth of property seems too small though you may be counting on equity in the case of needing large repairs. The 1.5% rule says 1M of property produces 15k of property upkeep leaving you with no personal savings in case of job loss.   By forgoing 401(k) or other retirement savings in favor of real estate investing youre allocating money to a small real estate business you own. That business is already a the majority of your net worth with a little split between the personal home and 401k.  Since your income might lapse with the career change risk I would prioritize paying down expensive debt (vehicle loan %?) and building up liquid savings. Once that is done look at the career change and increasing retirement savings.   Heres a ten minute video discussing real estate investing verses other assets - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rvY2rIxdsA
hmaah5q,raznog,11/27/2021,1,Most banks just call it ‚Äúbill pay‚Äù and for major businesses they can ACH the funds otherwise you put in the address and account info/name and they mail the check out. It‚Äôs very handy.
hm9h1sg,yut777_,11/27/2021,2,I live with my parents so I dont really *need* the money. Im mainly working to gain experience and to save a bit for my studies
hma88ru,ronald_mcdonald_4prz,11/27/2021,1,You don‚Äôt have a combined income with a gf. You each have your own income.
hmabj5c,MDfoodie,11/27/2021,1,Did you just arbitrarily determine $950 as the maximum?  A budget is based around personal goals income need etc. None of that has been offered here.
hm9sw7k,520throwaway,11/27/2021,1,Ditto in the UK and Spain. The American system looks like the 90s comparatively.
hmac1fn,MathAndCS_Nerd,11/27/2021,1,Ill let others that are more knowledgeable speak on best things for you to do but I can offer some basic definitions to get you rolling on your own research.  * 401k IRA ROTH traditional - these are terms meaning and/or generally used with retirement accounts. These would be accounts you add money to now but you dont access the money until youre retired.    * If you dont stay in the US this might not be something for you to care about. Or you might have a lot of fine print to read up on. Again others will have more knowledge on this. If your goal is to become a US citizen (or maybe even permanent resident?) and retire here in the US then these are things you would definitely want to learn about.    * Also if youre sticking around and becoming a citizen learn about our Social Security. There can be a lot of debates/discussions/etc about things with this but we do have a tax system everyone pays into that allows retired people (and permanently disabled people) to receive a monthly benefit check. It depends on how long youve paid into the system and how much youve earned. But again not a thing youd want to spend as much time on if youre not sticking around. * Savings - this is generally just your own cash on hand.    * HYSA - High Yield Savings Account - This is a bank account (like checking but instead called savings) that has a high interest rate compared to the market. Most people put their emergency fund and sink funds here.    * Emergency fund (EF) - This is cash quickly available (think: immediately or less than 2-3 days). This is cash set aside for nothing but emergencies. Usually people have X months of living expenses (X = 3 6 12 depends on who you ask). If your car breaks down you lose your job etc you want to not also have no money for food/rent/etc. This helps cushion any blow.    * Sink fund (SF) - This is saving up for a planned expense. Buying an expensive sofa going on vacation down payment for something like a house etc. Large planned expenses get put in their own bucket.    * Some people put more savings into things less quickly accessible like bonds CDs etc. They may consider this part of their EF or a SF but its understood this cash isnt immediately accessible or it is but with a fee. For example someone might have 3 months of their EF in a HYSA but then another 3 months in a CD. Or someone trying to buy a house but not for another couple years might put their SF in a bond.    * Anything other than those two are usually just savings and different people have different rules for their own accounts. But savings is rarely/never the same as the retirement accounts above since the retirement accounts are considered inaccessible until retirement while savings can be accessed at any time. * Brokerage accounts (aka securities accounts) - These are investment accounts for stocks bonds mutual funds and ETFs. This is separate from the others above typically. Although you also invest your retirement money so it grows as you work these are immediately(ish) accessible like savings.
hma0d0f,beets18,11/27/2021,1,If you have a Fidelity branch nearby you could try that too. You‚Äôll probably need to have an account there but you could just open one especially since they have a free $100 promo right now.
hmb5rus,o2msc,11/27/2021,1,I think a factor would be how much do you have in those retirement accounts at 50? If you won‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúneed‚Äù the ‚Äúother‚Äù $200000 for retirement then you could definitely pay off your primary residence. Or you could sell the investment property likely pay off your current house and truly be 100% debt free without touching your investments. That‚Äôs what I would do.
hma9m8c,ThunderDrop,11/27/2021,1,The main drawback to an FHA loan is the mortgage insurance you will have to pay lasts for the entirety of the loan instead of eventually falling away when you reach 20% equity.  This means you will need to refinace at some point in the future to stop paying an extra $200 per month.  Or move of course.  This sounds like a good situation for a starter home anyway.  Those dont really exist anymore but you can get more home for your dollar moving into a lesser school district and just plan to move in five years time.

hm9rbp2,KReddit934,11/27/2021,3,You should be able to move it into 401K or open new IRA but I believe (someone correct me) that *you have to add back that tax money so the full 901.74 amount gets into the new home*...If you do that you will get the tax money refunded at tax time.  If you dont...well its a partial withdrawal and a mess.
hm8uz4f,assertivelyconfused,11/27/2021,33,$50k in gains?    If so that makes quite a bit of sense.  A low effort $50K at 20% is a useful bit of change either for a luxury purchase or compounding interest in the future.    As an aggressive saver I‚Äôm able to save $36k/yr in a $140k/yr job.  The idea of making that in an instant?  Attractive.  Ppl sometimes forget how much stress jobs have at this pay range.  I also do not know if I can do this much longer much less forever even when pay increases are involved.    Anyway integrity matters to me so I‚Äôd never do such a thing.  I am also glad this guy got caught.  I can understand why he may be tempted tho.    What I really don‚Äôt understand are the six-figure gov‚Äôt employees who sell secrets for $6000.   Sometimes it‚Äôs bc of ideology or ego and not money - but still - those aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.    Anyway glad those ppl get caught too.

hmafxlx,tyclune121,11/27/2021,1,I have a taxable account online with them but don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a branch nearby I‚Äôll look into that though thanks!
hm9j77r,PersonalBrowser,11/27/2021,1,It‚Äôs definitely better to have multiple accounts. The person recommending a single account is factoring saving a couple minutes of setting up the account over everything else including being able to take tax advantaged distributions down the road since the account can only have one beneficiary.   On top of that most accounts these days allow you to have an external link for family and friends to gift money to the 529. So it‚Äôs helpful for the kids to each have their own.  Also people say that you can change the beneficiary no prob and that‚Äôs true that you can absolutely change it but in my experience it‚Äôs an annoying process and takes time and a hassle which outweighs the ease of having a single account.    It also helps you keep track of whose money is whose. For example when the kids are in high school if they work and put money into their 529 but the single 529 is for three kids then are you really going to be tracking how much of the account is whose and calculating the individual investment growth and returns of each kid? Doubt it.

hmaoh27,420throwawayacc,11/27/2021,1,Gotcha! I stand by my suggestion to use gig work and pay as much towards the loans as possible. In my eyes thats really the best option and will serve you better long term than taking another loan.   Good luck!!!
hma1xfm,Stable-McCafe,11/27/2021,1,Came here to say exactly this.   Also we arent disciplined enough is not a good excuse. Get disciplined if you wanna keep the house and keep your CC under control.
hma8xim,ZenGuruji,11/27/2021,1,I know everyone here is suggesting a budget but that would drive me mad.  What I would suggest is to simply pay off your bills and pay yourself for investing and savings and then just set aside the remainder to spend on yourself. If you end up not spending a lot no worries -- just the throw the remainder into savings or investments.  All these budgeting apps and spreadsheets would drive me mad. Its like counting calories when youre trying to lose weight. It works but usually also leads to headaches.

hmaks5f,styrofoam_cups,11/27/2021,1,If you stick to general funds/ETFs long term investing lowers the risk to pretty much 0. Has to be long term tho.   Completely understand your situation. I would put the 30k down payment (as I would consider that an investment). I am extremely weary on buying property in this market as a lot of property are selling over value so be careful
hmapfva,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,I dont want both.  I just have the Roth 401(k) through both our employers.  If I open up a Roth IRA Ill stop the contributions towards the Roth 401(k).
hmbb1ip,CPLeet,11/27/2021,1,1st off.. that 8% 401k match is great Pay!  Pay off the mortgage with the higher interest first. Sell the home at the higher marked up cost of how much are nowadays.  Then you can pay off your home and pocket the rest.   Work for about 2-3 more years to just save up and invest. Then retire before you turn 55.   The time you get in retirement is limited. Life is so short and you should spend as little of it as you can working. And as much as you can traveling vacationing or just sitting back taking daily naps.
hmas9pi,Joy8181,11/27/2021,1,Renting cheap isn‚Äôt a thing in high cost of living areas. You really don‚Äôt seem to understand that some things would be great to do but are not always possible for everyone  so adjustments can be made elsewhere to get similar end results.

hm9qiuu,nowordsleft,11/27/2021,5,Your time horizon with a 401k is probably 40 years. Stop looking at it. Daily movements are going to happen. It will go up and down.  Thats the market. Over the long term it will go up.  If you cant handle a $20 drop what is going to happen when you have $200000 invested in it in 10 years and it goes down $10000 in one day?  Stop worrying over it.  You should be looking at it a couple of times per year to make sure your asset allocation is still where you want it to be and to increase your contributions. Thats it. Youll give yourself an ulcer or do something stupid like sell low if you look at it too often.

hmajtpx,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,Others have suggested putting 10 or even 5% down for a house. With how expensive cashing out stocks are relative PMI that might make the most sense.

hm92ck1,WhatIsQuail,11/27/2021,1,Read the wiki. Are you missing a match by not investing in TSP? If so then you need to start contributing to get the match. You can always move out of the TSP if you EAS.  Other than that a Roth IRA might be a good call assuming your have low enlisted income. Youll have to judge for yourself on youre savings balance but if thats just an emergency fund then I imagine its pretty high considering you shouldnt have rent or many other expenses right now. You might think about using some of that to fund your IRAs.
hma78x3,football35249,11/27/2021,1,You should practice zero based budgeting. Every dollar from your paycheck has a purpose. Every line item in your budget should be accounted for.

hmb4gel,PurpleParrotFish,11/27/2021,1,I‚Äôm a 22 (almost 23) year old who got married at 21. Marriage is cheaper than being single in many ways. For one rent can be combined and you can easily get a 1 BR apartment instead of a 2 BR typically used in roommate situations. Food is also combined which is cheaper. You can also pull from 2 incomes for big purchases like one car needs replaced or one person has a medical expense. My husband and I recently got a house with a mortgage which we never could have been approved for individually. Plus you will still have one income if one person looses a job or looses income in some way. The advice your sister gave of making sure the other person can support themselves is what my mom said too though. My husband and I did it for a year and it wasn‚Äôt worth it. We spent so much extra money on rent just to spend all our time at one apartment or the other. My mom said it‚Äôs good to make sure the other person is responsible enough to help provide for the family which is hard to tell if you were both supported by parents before getting married. I do have a cousin who got married at 20 after never living alone before and her husband has never worked consistently since and used his degree. It‚Äôs been a huge money struggle for her. They are 30 something now. I think this is the type of situation my mom and your sister worry about.
hmax8kt,PieceofTheseus,11/27/2021,1,That sound really wrong price for that type of an ER visit.  The visit should cost around 2.5K with the CT being around 1-5K.  For Gallstones mine was 3.8K with CT and ultrasound.

hm997dm,outroot,11/27/2021,1,In addition to some of the good comments as to why use multiple 529 accounts I do separate accounts because Ive calculated for each child to get the same amount by the time they reach college (inflation adjusted). Obviously this could be off due to varying inflation and market performance but I want to be as fair as I can be.
hma8tjo,t-poke,11/27/2021,1,> Does anyone have an opinion on ESG funds as part of a portfolio of index funds?  The top companies in ESGV Vanguards ESG fund include shit companies like Amazon Facebook Google United Healthcare Comcast PayPal Bank of America McDonalds and AT&T just to name a few.  If ESG funds are supposed to invest in ethical socially conscious companies then theyre picking the wrong companies to invest in.  ESGs exist so people who dont actually look into the underlying investments can feel warm and fuzzy about their choices but theyre still investing in the same garbage companies that everyone hates.  Thats why I stick with total market index funds. I know most of my investments are in some truly terrible companies whose disappearance would make the world a better place. But investing in them is a necessary evil and I get the added diversification of the whole market.

hmaesv4,FeistyNeedleworker55,11/27/2021,1,I was actually wondering if theres a clause that protect the customer from what merchant promise to them even verbally or over the phone.
hmab9kp,ErikRogers,11/27/2021,1,I think theres a couple of things at work here...bear in mind  Im not an american and have only visited a handful of times.  Some companies especially among lower paying companies push employees towards receiving pay via some kind of cash card. It must be cheaper for the employer than doing direct payroll deposit. These cards arent *quite* bank accounts but likely work for most of the employees needs (can use it at the store or an ATM). Transfering money from one of these cards to your bank account is possible but the cash card company charges a fee for that...and its not instantaneous..  Heres the part where Im really speculating: at a Walmart Money Services counter you can get a cheque/money order to send your landlord and pay for it using a card. Is it cheaper than transferring to a bank account and writing your own cheque? No...but its faster and your rent is due and you didnt have enough on hand until payday.  Also if the cash card is good for 95% of your needs and it costs money to transfer to a bank and many chequing accounts are not no-fee you begin to wonder why bother with a chequing account?

hma9ucl,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,I know ideally wed have more money saved up for a down payment but we also were expecting to have another year to save for it. Weve done the math and can handle the monthly mortgage payment but its mostly the guilt of not having the money presaved like we had planned before buying a house. His mom kind of surprised us with asking us to start house shopping sooner than later. And we had originally considered renting between selling and buying but when we looked into it an apartment where we can bring our 3 animals and have enough space for us and the baby is going to cost us more monthly than a mortgage payment. So weve cut our budget as low as we can go for the last couple months and for the next few to save as much money as we can for a down payment. Were not in a horrible shape financially we just dont have a ton of savings besides our down payment right now.
hma88xi,wild_b_cat,11/27/2021,1,But those companies are already in VTI.

hm9nrou,decaturbob,11/27/2021,1, - the rate of tax growth on existing property really can not be compared to tax on NEW PROPERTY.  Assessors use actual purchase price on the new property which resets the tax assessment base. This has little to do with market value of existing properties except in a very remote way.  - we have owned our house for 27 years (1927 house) and being a longtime owner our taxes have gone up insignificant vs say the people across the street who bought their house 1 year ago ( 1929 built) who pay 2.5x the taxes we do.

hm9h38p,eggbirdegg,11/27/2021,1,I think the issue is with these hybrids theyre all selling before they even hit the lot. All say 10 of my quotes are cars in transit or order because none on lots. Maybe I will wait.
hmamc4y,chzsteak-in-paradise,11/27/2021,1,You should also file a police report for stolen package - many places let you do that online. You can give the report # to your CC company and the merchant.
hm90cpw,TreTrepidation,11/27/2021,-61,While further people are victimized ...is just the best. See what you want to do is allow him to commit more crimes that way when we finally stop the crime more crimes were committed so we can punish them more. ugh.      Edit: Oh yah fraud ring. LOL. Give me a break.
hma5jxm,FutureMagic444,11/27/2021,1,This is one of the many reasons I use credit cards exclusively. I have to submit my bank statements yearly where I live and they can verify my income just fine without knowing where every penny I spend goes. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business but mine. My statements are particularly short because all they show is my income and credit card payments. I have severe privacy issues üòÇüòÜ

hmagd8o,Legosmiles,11/27/2021,1,I‚Äôd like to point out that you being on the mortgage and you being listed with your husband on the house title are usually separate and that‚Äôs final word should it come to a divorce.
hm8vo47,SkepticAquarian876,11/27/2021,1,Can it all be held in a trust fund with out it being taxed again when they are older? Trust fund sounds better.
hmaxdr0,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,> the more beneficial your investment will be    This isnt usually true for DCA. Lump sum investing beats DCA in terms of investment growth around 60% of the time meaning lump sum investing will be more beneficial in the long run *on average*. DCA though as you point out is about reducing volatility. It does reduce volatility but on average it returns less over the same amount of time as lump sum does.
hmaizb8,IMovedYourCheese,11/27/2021,1,This particular scam probably goes back a century or more. Nothing new about it.
hmb643w,FellowConspirator,11/27/2021,1,(In the US) Marriage is not expensive in its own right. The cost of a marriage license is nominal and thats actually the only part of the process (and returning the signed and witnessed document to record the marriage) is the only real expense -- cheaper than dinner in a fancy restaurant. Anything you add to that is your own business.  Theres no real difference with regard to expenses and in fact some expenses can decrease (for example employer-sponsored benefits are generally cheaper for employee+spouse than they are for each employee too separately get benefits from their respective employers). Once you are married you are a team. You tend to have joint responsibility for your household (finances and otherwise) and enjoy a litany of legal rights with respect to property powers of attorney and other things which can be financially beneficial in many circumstances if they come up.  Whether or not you combine your finances explicitly or not you should be mindful that they become legally intertwined in various ways by marriage regardless (in some states more so than others). The extent to which you keep things separate is really a matter of personal choice and discipline. You will increasingly take on shared responsibility for debts and regular payments together.  My wife and I have our finances joined aside from tax-advantaged retirement accounts which dont support that (though we are primary beneficiaries of one another on our respective plans). All of our bills are paid from a shared pool our investments are in a shared pool all of our real estate is shared etc. In 25 years this has worked pretty well.
hm9b4ke,Julia_Kat,11/27/2021,1,Yeah throw that fact in too. This WOULD have been our 4th car we bought here. Shame were gonna have to find a new dealership. I dont think the what? $180 over the course of 6 years is worth losing a customer over.
hmaskpu,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,An IRA is an excellent place to start. Paperwork is minimal simple to setup and manage. She can do up to $6K for 2021 and has until April 15 of 2022 to contribute for this year. She can then contribute up to $6K (maybe as $500/month) starting 1 January 2022 for the 2022 tax year.   Schwab Fidelity or Vanguard (mine) are often mentioned as being easy to work with low fees and solid investment options. Almost anything she could do with a brokerage account she can do with any of these three. I stumbled into Vanguard and have no reason to switch but each has small pros/cons that even out.   Oh and its not a 25 year retirement fund its a (up to) 50 year rest of life fund. Very long term and doesnt change substantially just because one day she starts calling herself retired. Food clothing shelter and enjoying life shift a bit but its a shift not an earthquake.

hmb4b7i,Its-a-write-off,11/27/2021,1,1031 exchange yes. Where they dont take the profits they just buy another commercial property.
hmakihr,WolverineTherapy,11/27/2021,1,Call them and negotiate.  No insurance company pays that much.  Medicare takes a machete to bills like that.  They make a profit nonetheless.  Theyll offer you a payment plan on $35k.  Tell them you need the bill reduced.  Get them to reduce it twice before considering agreeing to a payment plan.
hmb6349,ack154,11/27/2021,1,Are you using your credit cards - like buying something and paying them off each month? Doing that and demonstrating on time payments and responsible credit usage is probably going to be more helpful than another credit card. And you really only need to do that with one of them.
hma7i9l,matto_2008,11/27/2021,1,Also how old are you? You seem to be making a lot of the right moves and it‚Äôs amazing how much upping some of those contributions can be in the long haul. I started my 401k @ 20 Bought my house at 23 and just started maxing my accounts at 31. My retirement is at about 150k and my NW about 275k. Majority of this has all been time in the market as I‚Äôve never been a ‚Äúhigh earner‚Äù.
hm9fdt9,Naive-Inspection,11/27/2021,1,never appled for it and I think Credit One has a way to find out when someone applies for a Capital One and sends them one of theirs w/out anyone applying for the card
hmacdgv,ahas-dubar,11/27/2021,1,i dont know you and im not judging you. i would give this same advice to anyone including my own children.   wait until 25 to marry. a lot of things happen in your early 20s.. if things go the wrong way the legalities of marriage only make it harder to move on.   listen to me or dont. just think about it.
hmagjlg,TK_TK_,11/27/2021,1,You should have her info as well and make sure that you are on your way to 1x your combined income by 30.   That income will almost certainly be higher by then so some of every raise should go to retirement until you reach a 15% contribution level. Some people count company match toward that % and some don‚Äôt I‚Äôve seen.   Also because I know more than one person who made this mistake 5% from you and 4% from her doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre contributing 9%. (I know it‚Äôs really obvious but I just have to throw it out there.)   I started with 6% at age 24 and just upped the contributions with every raise and promotion and am now in the position of retiring early if I want to. So it‚Äôs definitely doable to save more than adequately without even feeling it‚Äîbut do pay attention to it over time. Be sure to get your partner‚Äôs info and get on the same page (also see whether either of you has access to an HSA?) but it sounds like you‚Äôre off to a good start.  I wouldn‚Äôt add more to taxable accounts until you‚Äôre maxing all your tax-advantaged space. Remember that you can access your Roth contributions (not growth) without a penalty if you ever need to so you don‚Äôt have to worry that all your money is locked away until retirement age‚ÄîI know that‚Äôs a common concern when retirement is decades away.
hma28ka,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,I spent two hours this morning searching entry level jobs. Probably 80% of the ones I saw pay the same as what I make teaching preschool or just slightly more like $2 more. There were a few others like recruiting banking etc. but why would they hire me when I literally have no experience qualifications or interest in those jobs? I mean I could fake interest but Im also not a bubbly charismatic person who would be good at convincing people to buy cars or something like that.
hmajlzx,Riza101z,11/27/2021,1,Ya I‚Äôll be interested to see where her relationship goes (currently has a bf she really loves) because it doesn‚Äôt sound like she wants to get married till her late 20s but she also doesn‚Äôt want kids at all so that will probably work best for her life.  My bf and I want to get married but we‚Äôre way too young and don‚Äôt have the capabilities rn so we are aiming for after college.
hm8zqu8,blackmambasniper,11/27/2021,2,What do I tell them though? Like wouldnt they say im at fault or I would get penalized for having an accident?
hmao5j7,MasinMadasHell,11/27/2021,1,Your sister is not wrong but neither are you. Its two different perspectives. I didnt get married until 30 and by then I had been on my own and managed my money. We had a few hiccups with merging finances but were fine now. I have a friend who got married at 22 and they had years and years of adjusting and disagreeing about how to manage money. They are fine now however.   Keep talking to your boyfriend about money and how youll manage it together shared financial goals etc.
hman9tx,el_rico_pavo_real,11/27/2021,1,What are some of the key benefits of VXUS? Would you recommend I add that to this simple Brokerage account for the exposure to international markets? Dont worry I am just picking your brain not taking your response as formal financial advice. I personally like the idea of exposure to the international markets.
hma0ysn,Stable-McCafe,11/27/2021,1,You doing good. Boost your liquid savings to about 6-9months especially as your expenses increase with a child coming in.   Make the CC balance go away as fast as your can.  For 529 ask yourself how much would you like to contribute for your kids education. With tuition rates increasing 5% per year.. 18-19 years later youll be looking at a very different tuition and fee landscape for college students. Do that calculation for total sum and work backwards.  P.S. good for you to have a non-negotiable travel budget. So many people save and save and save and forget to enjoy life. Proud of u.
hma1c5a,my_new_throwaway106,11/27/2021,1,Thanks.  We each have retirement accounts but what I gave is the total.  My spouses income is rather small currently about $20K per year part time work while shes been focusing on other things.   Once the real estate gets back on track the two that we have will give about $2500 per month in additional income above the expenses.  COVID put a dent on the plans to raise the rent as a tenant who was projected to move didnt and the other tenant also got behind on rent.  We are waiting for a $8K check from the government to cover that.  They are both in areas where the rental market has gone up substantially but we cant raise the rent where we want it until we get new tenants.   I dont recall hearing that particular number before the 6x salary by the time youre 50.  Thats a solid chunk of change and we hadnt been shooting for that kind of goal.
hmaotd9,squishyfibbins,11/27/2021,1,Awesome going to call them Monday.
hm8x2w9,neilsarkar81,11/27/2021,1,$500 limit is only for instant transfer. For regular transfers the limit is $5000 daily and $10000 monthly.   (Source: I have an Ally account and regularly use Zelle to pay our Nanny.)
hma8iob,psalm139x,11/27/2021,1,Also Michigan here.   First your budget is awesome. Nice job! Im impressed with how dialed in you are.   The two things I noticed is that your gas/electric with most likely be higher than $70. I have a pretty small house and keep my thermostat low but in the winter my gas is at least $70 alone. In the summer its the air conditioning. Factor in Christmas lights for a few months and it might be more like $120 together.   You also might want to add a Charity category.  There is always something to give money to. I see the gift category but I have found that setting aside some money every month for others makes me less of a miser.
hmae5a0,FindFIREsomeday,11/27/2021,1,In my opinion you missed a few steps. But personal finance is personal of course.  My thoughts:   1. $1000 or $2k buffer 2. Company match for 401k 3. Actual emergency fund 4.  HSA (if applicable) 5. Roth IRA ($6k/ person) 6. Max 401k  ($19.5k $20.5k next year for each person with a traditional job) 7. Maybe house? But probably non tax advantaged investments would be better.    Mortgage rates are insanely low currently.  If your rate is 2.5% to 3.5% youre really not giving yourself much of an advantage by paying it off early.  Thats below current inflation.
hm9yovm,boolda,11/27/2021,1,There is no advantage of Roth 401k over Roth IRA. In fact in many ways company Roth 401k is different and worse than RIRA. I will do company match with pretax money fully fund a Roth then go back to company if I have more money.
hmaqysb,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,I understand what youre saying and I appreciate the time youre taking to respond. Im not sure I would agree that 20% means youre absolutely sure and that anything less than that means the opposite. My husband and I have been together for 13 years come January. Well have been married for 3 lived together for 6 and were positive that buying a house together is the right step for us. But he was a child of divorced parents and my parents were not happily married despite being in a marriage until my mom passed in 2015. We have friends going through an ugly divorce right now as well. While I love my husband and neither of us can see getting a divorce anywhere in the future and I would say we have a healthy good marriage I dont think its unreasonable to ask what would happen with the mortgage if we were to ever get divorced. Youre correct that I have a lot more student loan debt than he does. To be fair up until we paid off all of our credit card debt in October he also had a lot more credit card debt than I did. Weve accepted our debt levels and I would love to pay more down on my student loans. That will be our goal after buying a house. I dont necessarily think its fair for him to take full liability on the mortgage or the full brunt of the debt to income ratio from it just because my student loan debt is higher. I was simply curious if it was a reasonable thing to do take myself off the mortgage for those reasons and what that would mean if things ever go south years down the road from now and we do wind up divorced. Shit happens ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

hm90u1z,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,This is actually one of the better real estate investment examples we see here.   OPs potential rental passes the 1% rule has a cap rate of ~8% and cash on cash return of over 40%.  Do this with 3 rentals and your investments are earning what a fulltime minimum wage worker earns in a year. Plus the equity thats building up.
hma3ifi,Ionic_liquids,11/27/2021,1,I dont understand these archaic systems. Why is it not direct debit transfer? Its kind of simple.
hm9vlz4,ASHAKANTASHARMA,11/27/2021,1,I depends on the net saving you are having and the non monetary benefits you are getting as a result of the informal job. These also needs to be considered.   You seems like confident have abilities and skilled who can dive into a more formal job opportunities.  You can register at Job Forums side by side looking for a better change.
hma29pt,wickedkittylitter,11/27/2021,1,Youre behind on savings.  A total of $27k in retirement for a couple of 30/32 year olds is low.  And if your only other savings/investments is $10k youre even more behind.  Before you plan an international vacation for 2022 check with your insurance plan(s) to see how much of the cost of pregnancy/birth/after care you will be responsible for paying.  You may find that youll need to use the $7k to pay for the baby rather than take a vacation.  Its all about priorities and which is more important.  Posters here are good at pointing out where improvements can be made in budgets so list all your income and all your expenses and youll get good suggestions on how to cut your budget to save more.
hm9w5ac,yeah87,11/27/2021,1,This is the reason you want to do what your doing now: your expenses are likely to raise over time. Im in a similar boat but have 3 little ones and I know as sports and activities and college come into the picture the maxed 401(k) is less likely to happen. Youre doing the heavy lifting now so you have wiggle room later.
hm9ryw3,yut777_,11/27/2021,1,I am in fact not paying taxes. My income would probably be too low but doesnt justify this nonetheless

hm8uf76,kbeezie,11/27/2021,3,Pending someone with much more experience chiming in. The route I would have taken is disputing the charges with the bank with PayPal being uncooperative in addressing fraud/theft which might lead to some movement on PayPal side (usually they start with locking your account as a response and going from there).   Because the way I would word it with PayPal is that they helped facilitate criminal activity by failing to respond to a complaint of breach on their end the time wasted likely also means the impossibility of getting the money back.  Since bank transfers tend to take days (held in PayPals system before being deposited on the other end) they were at the most effective stage to stop it if you contacted them the day the money was requested to be pulled out of your account theyre also in the best position to identify which accounts the money was being paid to. If nothing else might escalate to a higher tier of support.  Can probably look into a formal BBB complaint at the same time though they are not required to respond to mediation by them.
hm93is9,DeluxeXL,11/27/2021,22,> Can I call the HR departments of my old job and find out how much I made before I left?  Why? This information is on your paystub. It should have a YTD column.  > Also it‚Äôs really busy and I could work a few extra shifts but if it puts me into a new tax bracket that would be a bad idea right?  Only the income in the new bracket is taxed at that new brackets rate. If you are $50 into the 22% bracket only $50 is taxed at 22%.
hmaw6lz,Tiafves,11/27/2021,1,Plus at 6% for 52k a year thats basically 3000 a year.  If you cant build up an emergency fund and contribute that at the same time your emergency is things like you lost your job like 2 months in so basically paid nothing into your 401k anyway or had a medical emergency that would deplete your savings no matter how large they are.
hm9ow71,FinsterFolly,11/27/2021,2,Invest it is pretty direct. If you are looking for more detail try one of the prioritizing investments guides. The wiki hear has a good one.

hm9pkmx,jmfsn,11/27/2021,1,Id recommend you to open the account. Theyll also ask you to fill a W8-BEN certificate to claim that youll be paying any capital gains/dividends in your country and not in the USA (most European countries have a treaty for that). If you share your specific country I can probably point you to the right place. After youve taken ownership of the shares you can do as you please. If you need to sell them it can trigger capital gains but thats another issue.

hmacrsb,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,Maybe it has to do with the lack of available checking account?
hmac5a8,JhihnX,11/27/2021,1,No it isn‚Äôt arbitrary it‚Äôs based on the USDA‚Äôs (generally) liberal food plans and some rounding.  I‚Äôve bothered with rounding and adjusting for household size which puts the estimate at $1002.44.  But a budget for groceries really does not need to be so complicated as to need every detail.
hmak77d,EhhWhateverr,11/27/2021,1,Close it before the fee hits. Might bump your score down 10-15 points but I promise you‚Äôll recover within a few months.   Option 2 is to try to get the fee waived. Call the credit card company and say you‚Äôre considering closing the card but ask if they have any ‚Äúretention benefits‚Äù available. I do this for all of my cards that have fees and they waive it 75% of the time. The other 25% of the time I close the card.
hmanesz,aim4harmony,11/27/2021,1,Thanks. What is HELOC? I consider a gig work and seek for a new permanent job too. Honestly my student loan was delayed for a few years and recently I got a letter from collectors which means the institution was not satisfied with the proposed payment plan. The student loan is the only type that haunts all the time and does not expire.
hm95q49,skinnedalmond,11/27/2021,0,Thanks! We did we went through our states web system that manages government employee pensions. It allowed us to calculate his pre-tax pension based on when he plans to retire. I‚Äôll triple check though if this seems extraordinary
hmau7g9,Joy8181,11/27/2021,1,Because I have a family with kids not sharing with random roommates.  So rent is what it is in this area and it‚Äôs not cheap. I‚Äôm not sure what you don‚Äôt understand about housing costs in this area central north Jersey. We saved for years to be able to have 20% down payment emergency fund and maxing our retirement and now we do own a home that cost more than three times salary because three times my salary would be 220000 and there are literally no suburban homes that price here. You‚Äôre really just being obtuse and smug at this point.
hma243s,russ257,11/27/2021,1,There is no issue with this as long as he pays you back. My wife and I share a phone plan with her parents. MIL just writes me a check each month for their portion of the bill.

hm8z3zu,Mental_Tax_2653,11/27/2021,2,I think it really depends on where you live. Mobile home are like cars in that they are SUPPOSED to depreciate. However I have witness in my market mobile homes have been going up in prices in the past 6 years. My in-laws bought a double wide for 40k in 2015 and everything double wide around them is selling over 100k no land just the trailer.  Now with that being said I would proceed with caution as they are harder to finance and insure. Also the rent price on the lot affects how much or if they appreciate.

Btw suggesting your dad reduce his SS *for the rest of his life* so he can buy a house today is a shit move and a good indicator that maybe dad should be talking to a different broker.
hm948qc,islangmemes,11/27/2021,1,I always get a loan I know I can easily afford and then make extra payments to pay it off early if I have extra money laying around. This will help account for things such as layoffs or any unexpected financial occurrences.   Ex: I took a 5 year car loan out paid it off in 3.  I took a 30 year mortgage and started making double payments last year when I drastically increased my income.   You won‚Äôt see drastic changes to your credit because of the length of the loan you take. Nor will you see that great of a credit improvement for paying it off early. But it will look good going forward to underwriters when they see you‚Äôve paid off loans on time or early with no delinquent payments. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to make sure loan terms are realistically obtainable. Over committing will only hurt you.

hmabrrc,robb0995,11/27/2021,1,I mean‚Ä¶ sorta?  You are correct that only dollars that fall into a given tax bracket get taxed at that rate and that it absolutely doesn‚Äôt hurt you to go into a higher tax bracket.   However nobody is taxing you throughout the year. Your employer (or yourself if self-employed) withholds estimated taxes but you‚Äôre not actually taxed until you file your return when everything is known. Your withholding just deposits money in your ‚ÄúIRS account‚Äù and it‚Äôs settled up at tax time including earnings from all sources deductions credits and other adjustments.

hmaqcbl,ronnevee,11/27/2021,1,Well if you get more pay you have more take-home. That its bonus pay doesnt change the scenario though since its taxed the same. I think entering your salary amount minus the pre tax deduction sand then just adding in the fica taxes mentally would be your best bet then. Smartasset would show your marginal fica rate on your last dollars to that would help.

hmagsg7,ploetzlichbanana,11/27/2021,1,Thats good general information thank you. I dont think we will be able to leverage exactly the same structure as US trust-funds here in Europe so my next move will be to have a look on how one can setup an investment account on behalf of someone else. Again taxation might be a show-stopper here. But from I gather from your post in any case I should seek legal advice and make sure that the person giving it is competent in the various jurisdictions.  Another option could be to trust the parents to set it right in their respective countries of residence but I like this option less.

hm9n9iq,sir_richard_head,11/27/2021,1,First off they should not have done that.  If your balance was >$1k they were obligated to roll it into an IRA instead of cashing it out.  You need to contact them and tell them to fix this immediately because the amount was only under $1k _because_ they took out taxes.  You need a check for the full $1086.61.  Whether it is this check or the correct check open an IRA with a financial institution of your choice.  The type of IRA depends on whether you get this corrected or not.  You should be able to sign the check over to them directly but get their advice on it as every institution may want something different.  Some places may have a minimum balance to fund an IRA so you may need to combine it with a little bit of cash to meet a minimum.  You need to have the money in an IRA within 60 days in order for it to not count as a withdraw.
hm9u18f,woollywhelk,11/27/2021,1,Thinking about taxes in retirement today for some reason just curious. So with a traditional 401k the disbursement amount is fully taxable since the contributions themselves were tax deferred. For after-tax investment accounts (not Roth) only the earnings (not contributions) are taxable. Are those shares sold in a certain order like FIFO by default or how does that work?
hmap1xx,aim4harmony,11/27/2021,1,Thank you. That makes sense. My father has almost repayed a house loan by doing small gigs (mainly as helping hand with construction) besides permanent work.

hmai5hf,peacefulhectarez,11/27/2021,1,First the withholding rate for supplemental income is 22% not 45. No one pays 45% in Federal income tax (the top marginal rate is 37% and starts at over $500k). If OPs tax rate is less than 22% s/hell get some back in April.  Second actual relocation expenses--shipping your stuff mileage and hotels for driving etc.--used to be deductible until Trumps Tax Cuts and Job Act killed that deduction in 2017. Previously your employer could pay for those expenses tax-free. Now its income even if the employer hires and pays the movers themselves.

hmatfrw,TheJoshWatson,11/27/2021,1,Personally I would just hold onto it.  I live in an area that just a few years ago was considered to be kind of useless undeveloped land. It was dirt cheap and no one wanted to buy here.  Then suddenly several tech companies built new campuses here and now it‚Äôs booming. The  lots here are selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars per acre some for millions.  So it might take a long time even more than your lifetime. But land is a finite resource there‚Äôs only so much to go around on the earth. So eventually that area will probably be developed even if it is  a hundred years from now.  So personally if someone left me some land I would just hold onto it especially for $25/year.   Another relevant story: my friend purchased 30 acres of undeveloped land to put a vacation cabin on. He bought it three years ago for like $25k and now that land is worth around $300k. He just had it appraised recently when land in the area suddenly went up in price.  He‚Äôs going to keep it because the prices are still going up and he still wants a vacation cabin.  My point is you really never know with land. But it will basically never go down in value. Land is a really really good long term investment.
hmaf7gc,kittenbomber,11/27/2021,1,Probably high. Although my wife and I (plus two kids) went through one of our cards lately and there was $3k on restaurants there.

Once the money is in my landlords hands it is not my responsibility for what happens to it.  If he deposited a cheque and his girlfriend stole it from the account that would be his problem not mine.  Is there any reason it would be different with Venmo?  >Something like a credit card has security features to get your money back promptly (a la charge back) which is essentially what youre paying for using a credit card.  This makes sense thank you.   >Tldr: need to pay with verifiable proof? Pay with someone elses money (the banks) not yours.

hmbbs61,Pleasant_Carpenter37,11/27/2021,1,Counterpoint:  Paying extra on the mortgage merely reduces the principle owed it doesnt prevent a foreclosure in the event of a job loss.  An extra $150/month will shave about 5 years off a mortgage so the job loss risk is still there for nearly 25 years instead of 30.  Your suggestion would save people who bought in the early 90s from losing their house in the Covid recession assuming they hadnt lost their house in the dotcom crash or the Great Recession.  IMO better advice would be to put that extra principal payment money into a HYSA or I-bonds for ~10-20 years instead then make a balloon payment when you have enough to end the mortgage.  In an emergency youll have part of that mortgage-buster fund available to keep making mortgage payments.

hma8f5h,SeaworthinessOk4046,11/27/2021,1,Some hopefully useful insights to deferred compensation plans:  * youre deferring compensation from this year to some future years(s) that you get to pick.  Note that you pay payroll taxes on this compensation the year its earned (social security medicare)-- the tax on this compensation that you are deferring is the federal income tax.  the net here is that it reduces your income this year-- and hence your tax burden. * in my experience (private sector) you can not access deferred comp until the previously picked distribution dates.   * check out what investment options you have for DC Ive seen some where its a fixed percent per year and others where one can choose between a couple of investment options. * the DC grows tax free (like a 401k) until it gets distributed.   * You pay federal tax (and not payroll) when its distributed. * Id double check on these:    * If you are still employed with the company the year  some of your DC might be distributed you can choose to again defer it    * If you are let go of the company you may have the ability to further define how your DC is distributed one last time.  Just one other comment on the kid entering college you might considerI  bonds.  Youre limited to 10k (15k if you get tax refund) per year and the interest is adjusted for inflation.  right now its paying 7.12%.  The downside is you cant access for a year you lose the last 3 months of interest if you cash it in before 5 years and the interest rate is adjustable.   But you pay no state/local tax and if you use it for educational expenses you pay no federal taxes on it.

hm9c3ai,CollateralSandwich,11/27/2021,1,OP Im even going to ask that you consider staying in longer and making it a career. If you truly are rudderless you can do far far worse than a career in the military. Just make sure youre not in a position to be a bullet-stopper. 20 years in and you can start collecting a pension at 40% of your rate. 30 years is 60%. Taking yourself to the private sector at 40 with training connections and a resume will likely catch the eye in good ways while collecting a bit on the side is nothing to sneeze at.  I went National Guard and didnt re-up. In middle age and with hindsight I wish Id gone full time and stayed in. With the right MOS you could do well for yourself. Dont let your recruiter talk you into anything. They just want the spiff for getting you into a shit MOS they need filled.

hma7m5j,Frozenlazer,11/27/2021,1,You need to talk to an attorney . Or at least whatever type of professional deals with these things in your country. In the US it would be an estate planning attorney.  You are likely going to run into the need to reconcile the laws of the different nations at play here.   In the US at the most basic level trust funds are about how the account is controlled. From there what the trust does is only limited by the law and your willingness to spend money on lawyers.it could be as simple as cash in a bank account or as complex as shares in a company owned by a private indivudyal that have a pre determined valuation schedule etc with 10 pages of limitations on how and when the money can be used.  For most families the value of a trust is related to control. For example an 8 year old has no business inheriting 200k directly. A trust can direct how that money is spent. And thats what most people use a trust for. The other value of a trust is usually related to the tax treatment of the money in the trust. In the US gift tax laws are related to the value of the gift when it is given  so if I give you shares in a shell company that are basically worthless now Ive not given you much of a taxable gift. But then if those shares are worth 10M when I die and you get control then Ive avoided making a taxable gift . ( That is a dramatic over simplification)  Source wife is estate attorney.
hm9f4ph,krystalina28,11/27/2021,1,You live in NYS you have the SUNY system at your disposal. Low income students can apply to federal and state grants that could cover the entirety of the tuition costs if granted the full amount. Any extra money left over is yours. If your income is too high to qualify for Pell or Tap you can also be eligible to the Excelsior Scholarship (income <$125000). You dont have to go into debt to go to college especially if you reside in New York.  You dont have to start at a 4-year college either. If you dont have the best grade out of high school start at a community college and transfer out after a year or two into. Do all that within SUNY/CUNY and youll have no problem with credit equivalencies. If you were to live at home while in school tuition and books would be the only college related cost you would have and provided you get the grants even if just a percentage that cost should be relatively low if not inexistent. There are also other grants fellowships and scholarships you can apply to while in school to help you fund career experiences and widen your professional network. You dont have to graduate without professional experience or job prospects.  Idk what got you thinking of Alabama but if you were to go through with that route youd be enrolling as an out of state students thus doubling your tuition. Adding in relocation room and board youd end up getting into debt. I strongly suggest against that idea unless theres more to this relocation plan were not privy to.  Just know there are financial resources available to low income students. Also college is one of the best places for career exploration and networking youll have at your disposal.

hm8uhgx,savagemonitor,11/27/2021,14,Ill have to ask my family as they were in banking for decades at all different sorts of levels short of executive.  I would be a little surprised if it didnt happen but back then Im betting that people did things like steal from the till or short change customers they thought wouldnt catch it.  Mainly because Id have to think that was easier than trying to randomly reach out to a customer since that was harder.  Today though most deposits are likely done via machine (either ATMs or computers) so the tellers dont have the same opportunities they did in the past.  Mix that in with the begging culture that companies like GoFundMe have fostered and the people that had no qualms about stealing back then are the ones that are trying to rip off customers directly now.
hm9w5dc,DesignatedVictim,11/27/2021,1,Do you have an emergency fund equal to six months of your expenses? If no I‚Äôd build that e-fund first then contribute to the Roth.   In theory you can contribute to the Roth IRA and consider that your e-fund but generally speaking the funds in that Roth should be invested aggressively for decades until retirement. Meanwhile it may not be prudent to invest one‚Äôs e-fund which depends on one‚Äôs financial situation and risk tolerance.  The other thing I‚Äôd consider is the monthly cost of the PMI and how soon you can remove it. Create an amortization schedule in Excel/Google Sheets and project when you will hit the LTV ratio that will allow removal of PMI using the current mortgage payment. Set up a second schedule with an additional $100/$150/$200 in principal paid. How much sooner will you get to PMI removal with the accelerated payments and how much more money will you be able to contribute to your Roth after the PMI is removed?

hmanywt,ThunderDrop,11/27/2021,1,The closest thing I know of is buying a rental in an opportunity zone to defer and minimize capital gains taxes.  Your income isnt capital gains though so this doesnt help you.
hmayhdk,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,> What leverage do I have in this situation?    Pretty much the only leverage you have is they wouldnt have to look for a new tenant. However if theyre anything like the lessor Im using a new tenant would pay more than $1196.02 anyway. For example Im paying around $1350/mo after a $70 increase...but if I were a new tenant just moving in it would be closer to $1500-1600 for the same space. Literally the only reason my lease increase is less than that is because it saves them lost rent from waiting for a tenant and such.    So the only leverage you have they may already be accounting for (by charging a new tenant $1400 or something instead of the $1200 theyre charging you). They may be viewing the raise to $1200 as a break to you for remaining a tenant - which means you effectively have zero leverage outside of any state regulations in place due to Covid.    You can always try negotiating with them just dont think you have some automatic unquestionable way into getting out of the increase. Unfortunately thats the risky side of renting....you could always buy and your mortgage itself will stay static for 30 years or so (depends on the term) though there are other costs associated that can change from year to year.
hm9iymp,Distributor127,11/27/2021,1,I know a young woman hat bought a salvage title car.   It can be a risk.  Ive seen them blow fuses forever.  But this woman put the savings toward buying a house with her boyfriend.   Worked out great

hma85ry,SilverTanager,11/27/2021,1,If you want to protect your family more without shutting down the business you should focus on improving your and your partners recognition of the LLC/corporate formalities.  Its not enough to just set up an LLC or corporation you also need to be careful to keep the businesss and your personal finances separate.  For example pay yourself a regular salary dont use the businesss bank account to directly pay your personal expenses or vice versa keep clear records of business expenses and make sure those are being paid through the businesss account keep the businesss assets in its name and your assets in your name etc.  States generally have a way--like an alter ego action--for creditors to ask a court to disregard the LLC or corporation and go after an owners individual assets if the owner didnt respect the LLC/corporate formalities himself.  By meticulously keeping your and the businesss finances separate you are more likely to have a court respect the existence of the LLC if you are sued and be able to keep your personal assets safe.
hm8yabb,assertivelyconfused,11/27/2021,13,I‚Äôm not I meant that a $50000 capital gain would be taxed at 20% netting him $40000.    $200k/yr in California ~37% of paycheck goes to taxes.  Edit: the capital gain rate he‚Äôd pay is actually more likely to be 15%

hm9ouve,sleevelesspineapple,11/27/2021,1,I work in payroll.  It‚Äôs just good sense if someone is missing an ENTIRE paycheque to issue a wire transfer as soon as the funds have been returned to the company bank.  I assume the employee is living pay cheque to pay cheque in those situations.  However if it was only one or two missed shifts due to the employee failing to clock in (as an example) we would advise the funds would come through on the next pay cycle unless they come back and say they are in financial distress or it gets escalated otherwise which is rare.

hm9da1d,radwagonier,11/27/2021,1,A few thoughts:  If you had instead inherited $300k cash would you have bought a big old house with that money? Probably not.   The upside is that a 24yo inherited a house instead of cash. Most 24yo‚Äôs who inherit that much cash end up living with a lot of regret.   One thing you could do is sell the house buy a small starter home in a place you‚Äôd like to live and spend the proceeds putting yourself through school to enter a lucrative career.   Do not buy the next house with your girlfriend. It‚Äôs your house.

hmaetd5,FindFIREsomeday,11/27/2021,1,VTSAX is just a fund name.  You can buy it in a Roth IRA or in other types of investment account.  VTSAX is also the vanguard version of a total stock market index fund. If your IRA is with vanguard VTSAX would be great.  If your IRA is with Schwab youd want to figure out what Schwabs version is. Same is true for fidelity or other financial companies.  You might be charged a premium for buying the fund outside of their institution.  But they should all be pretty similar with low fees.
hma00c6,OlympusAmateur,11/27/2021,1,Bump it to full match - 6%. Your looking at just over $1000 annually on your side. Or about $20 bucks per week. Shave the $20 from pocket money. Work a part time job to build savings or add to school loan. Im 72 years. My wife and I were educators never making large salaries. But I always maxed retirement funding even with children in college. We just got back from 3 weeks in the Mediterranean and travel like that several times per year only because we lived below our means and maxed retirement funding. Youre young and have time on your side. You can always scramble for extra immediate money needs. In the senior years scrambling for extra cash often means would you like fries with that burger sir. Bump that 401K to full match.
hmbbklg,rella_or_not,11/27/2021,1,I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre in distress. Regarding your skin I think that is a worthy thing to spend money on. Scarring is serious. Go to doctor if you can but in the meantime make sure you are being gentle with your skin and you keep it clean. Chronic acne can be like an open wound that just is in a vicious cycle if it never heals. I go to a really pricey esthetician and she said that she recommends Korean skin care products to people on a budget or just starting out. You might want to do additional research but I would recommend just focusing on getting a cleanser and a moisturizer. I really like [Soko glam](https://sokoglam.com). You deserve to live in a healthy body your skin included.

hm9u7cy,txholdup,11/27/2021,1,Please stop thinking of 401k IRA 457b as retirement accounts and instead think of them as tax sheltered wealth building accounts.  See problem solved you can never put too much into wealth building accounts.  And your Roth IRA especially isnt limited to retirement.  You can pull out your contributions when you are 40 or 32 but in the meantime all of your earnings grow tax free.   And dont forget your taxable stock/mutual fund account.  They will be your godsend if you decide to quit work early.

You shouldnt be worried but you should be properly allocated as youre closer to retirement.   >  It‚Äôs definitely scary not knowing if I‚Äôm invested in something that can rebound.   If youre invested in broad market index funds they can always rebound. Just as an example Apple is like 5% of that blackrock fund right now. Apple makes lots of products that millions of people buy. They make lots of money and lucky for you you own part of them! Now repeat that for Coke Microsoft American Airlines Auto Zone and Keurig and another 900+ companies.
hmb9zpo,wild_b_cat,11/27/2021,1,I bonds are good when you have medium term investing horizons. The 1 year lock up makes them a poor choice for money you might need in the near future but the long term returns aren‚Äôt as good as general market investments.

hma93g2,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,My advice is both simple and hard.   What purpose does your over spending especially using cc serve? Answer that and youll be half way to being to able to make better decisions AND follow through on them.   You say not disciplined enough but in my experience in the world doing something even when you dont want to do it is usually indicative of an underlying issue.   If only knowing the right answer were enough in life wed all be the perfect size for us super fit and have a bitchin savings account right?   Interrogate what it is youre actually buying. Is it a new feeling? A look good in front of others? Affection? A distraction?   Are you in fact simply living a lifestyle that is currently beyond your means?   In answer to your question I judge it to be unwise to do anything else financially until you get your arms around the underlying drivers for your repeatedly choosing unwise cc spending.

hma36j8,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,I agree but I just worry about paying them back. Based on my calculations if theyre correct then I think I would end up with at least $10000 in savings and still have no debt IF I keep working both jobs until I graduate. Meanwhile if I only work one job and take out more loans Ill just have more loans and nothing in savings... But theres always the risk that Ill fail a class from running out of time to complete an assignment fall asleep driving etc. so Im not sure if the other job is worth it. Maybe if I can find a PT job with a better schedule. Thank you!
hmaepw0,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,This is fairly common. Happened to me also.    I think the finance companies do it to keep the dealers honest.

hmac086,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,In a 15+ year time horizon taking risk is what investors are compensated for. With a historical spread of 5.2% real global equity returns verses 1-2% real average home appreciation the compensation is absolutely worth the risk. In the case of an individual home the variance is much higher. Besides OP has liquid funds in the form of emergency funds two incomes and stocks in a taxable brokerage.   Owning a single home is a risk due to the risks of credit real estate sector country city and individual property risk. You dont get those uncompensated specific risks with a globally diversified portfolio of stocks. A medium sized natural disaster you arent insured for would knock a global index down perhaps 5% and a home down 100%.  Paying down a mortgage is equivalent to buying a bond that pays the mortgage interest rate. Why would any young person planning for the long term want to buy such a low yielding asset?
hmacfoh,Neatguyonline,11/27/2021,1,500k loan on a 125k salary is a bit of a stretch but probably doable.  Why are you moving?  If it‚Äôs for work I would expect a COL raise of some kind.

hmbd41r,Abductedllama,11/27/2021,1,I switched within the last year from PNC to Chase. There really isn‚Äôt much difference between the two. One feature I missed from PNCs virtual wallet was entering checks into the system that would update your account. It was a nice quality of life feature that I don‚Äôt have in Chase (at least the type of checking I have).  I only switched from PNC to Chase because I was repairing my credit and really wanted specific cards from them. I figured building a relationship with them would help me get to the card I wanted and I have the card. So I guess it did.
hm9wr3g,iamnewnewnew,11/27/2021,1,>Even accounting for discounted cash flows or simple interest it would still be greater than the 1st NPV. What gives? Why would anyone choose the 1st investment over the 2nd?  The issue is youre looking at 2 very different comparisons.
hmb84qo,jellicle,11/27/2021,1,Haha no.  If banks were interested in helping the customer they would process credits to the account first followed by debits.  But they do the opposite.  It is 100% designed to maximize the fees charged to the customer.
hmavts7,ooglieguy0211,11/27/2021,1,Okay so Im glad people are trying to help you out here by telling you not to leave it at the tow yard. I can give you some information as to why you should leave it there. I know people assume that tow yards are a scam I can assure you that they are not most anyways.  As a former towman for over 10 years I can offer this advice. By leaving the car at the tow yard the insurance company will be more inclined to get to your claim more quickly. If its sitting at your house or some other place where its not gaining storage fees they dont see an immediate need to get to it. At a tow yard the insurance company has access to it if they need any more info instead of having to schedule with you to meet them (this applies more to accidents that require investigarions). If they choose to send out an adjuster to the vehicle to see assess it to know if its totalled or just needing repair they can get to it easier. If they just want to repair it its in a place thats easy for them to get to it to have that done with minimal hassle to your day to day life.  I get it you dont want to pay more fees. It depends on how the accident is handled as to what you would be responsible for. That $12 fee is usually handled by the insurance company when they do the assessment and often given to you if you request it. It also depends on whether or not you live in a no fault state or not. The insurance companies are often tasked with assigning or building a case to assign fault when the officers on scene arent allowed to.   All of that being said you do whatever you feel that you should do. If you choose to leave the vehicle at the tow yard to help speed the process up make sure you call the tow yard and make time to go down and get your belongings from the vehicle.
hmavtim,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,Lol I hate to break it to you but the US government specifically the Patriot Act has eliminated any right to privacy at your bank.  Quite the opposite is happening. Banks are getting huge fines for KYC/ AML violations.    The government wants the banks to be all up in your business so they can pretend no money is going to our enemies.   My bank takes your complaints about this and uses it as evidence that we are strictly adhering to the government requirements.    Hate the game not the players. Your fight for privacy should be in DC.    https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer  Edit: The future of KYC/AML will be artifical intelligence where machines can get up in your business at a mass efficiency low cost

hmaxc52,rb1_man,11/27/2021,1,If you know how much you pay each month and you know how much you use each month it should be pretty easy to extrapolate your rate. Figure it out over a few months and see if the rate fluctuates or stays consistent.

hm9up58,lala614,11/27/2021,1,Was in a similar situation with a parent. I opened him a traditional IRA since he won‚Äôt really be earning more than now. Maxed it out at 7K and he will be doing this going forward. Made him a budget for this. Put some of his  other savings in a an I-Bond (though know it can‚Äôt be touched for at least a year). Lowered/negotiated some bills like phone internet and car insurance. And looked into his social security savings situation to see what that will look like. There‚Äôs a website where you can login and see how much you‚Äôve been saving for retirement there super important to review in case of mistakes!
hmatv8a,blacklassie,11/27/2021,1,Since you say you want to hire a management company you should look into the costs associated with that. Those costs can eat into your profit enough that renting may no longer look that attractive.
hmakpsf,93195,11/27/2021,1,This one‚Äôs going to get messy.    Merchant will say they delivered it with signature required (which I‚Äôm assuming Fetch provided) so ‚Äúnot it‚Äù.  Fed Ex will say they got a signature so ‚Äúnot it‚Äù.  Fetch will say they provided a service that you probably are automatically opted into in general from the apartment complex so ‚Äúnot it‚Äù.  And you are definitely ‚Äúnot it‚Äù.  So dispute it with your credit card company let them figure it out.  If you never got it they usually land on your side.
hmawg2m,ooglieguy0211,11/27/2021,1,So the insurance company has more time to make a decision or takes more time to get to it since its not building fees that they will have to pay for?
hm9l8ze,chaoticneutral262,11/27/2021,1,Investing in yourself especially when you are young is one of the most important things you can do.  That said most books are only read one time so it is a waste to own one if you will not use it again in the future (such as a reference guide).  In most cases the best thing to do is borrow a book from a library if they have or can get what you want.  A quick search of my local library shows that they have dozens of books on Korean as well as CDs where you can hear it spoken to you.

hmaggx0,AJimJimJim,11/27/2021,1,+1 from someone who dated his wife since high school but got married at 28. There are some tax advantages to marriage if you dont make similar incomes but otherwise really no reason to rush in to it straight out of college IMO.
hmb8e5u,Topher_86,11/27/2021,1,It‚Äôs not expensive‚Äî just risky.  I would see marrying that young as a financial risk. Brain development continues to around age 25 or so tying financially to another person before this point could be disastrous as there is ample room in the development window for a person to change. Upsides are minimal as at such a young age the majority of people will likely have few assets if not in debt already.  It‚Äôs a reasonable conclusion to think the most someone will take on is the others‚Äô debts at such a young age. Essentially the risk-vs-reward isn‚Äôt there.
hmba1ea,snorkleface,11/27/2021,1,Yes 1000x yes sell the crypto to pay off the debts. Especially if you can knock two cards out immediately by doing so.
hmapsiv,MFSHou,11/27/2021,1,Be sure to check your bill against your Explanation of Benefits (which is a document that your insurance company will send to you after any claims are filed on your behalf). The EOB will tell you for sure what was paid by your insurance any charges that are discounted or are not applicable under the contract and what you may owe.  A lot of providers will try to talk you into taking any money owed to you as a credit towards future services. Up to you whether that‚Äôs acceptable or not.
hm9uyx1,Bandit_the_Kitty,11/27/2021,1,Depends on your goals but vanguard target date funds are useful because they rebalance their asset mix as you approach the target date.

hmbo42s,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,Roth IRA is an account not an investment. Mutual funds are investments not a type of account. Mutual funds can go inside Roth IRAs.  &#x200B  Also VTI is an ETF not a mutual fund. VTSAX is the mutual fund version of VTI.
hmb6qff,ionlydrinkIPAs,11/27/2021,1,There is no benefit to having a score above 760 (or 740 depending on the lender) when it comes to getting a mortgage. You will be getting the exact same interest rate at 760 as you would at 800+.   And no a secured card isn‚Äôt going to improve your credit any faster than an unsecured card will. In fact the low limit on a secured card would be less beneficial than getting a larger limit (and better rewards/benefits) with an unsecured card.
hmbi0ax,OperaticIguana,11/27/2021,1,Yikes. Heat pumps dont work as efficiently if the temperature is below 40 so I think theyre generally not recommended as primary heating for northern climates.  But it definitely sounds like the backup heating coils are running all the time.
hmbgf59,AllTheyEatIsLettuce,11/27/2021,1,>The PA I saw told me the imaging center would be in network  Unless PA in this instance means *personal assistant* to the insurance seller what PA tells you about insurance seller networking is meaningless at best.  Exception: you were at the VA and didnt know it you were a traditional Medicare enrollee under some very specific conditions and didnt know it or you were told by PA whose employer and the facility and the insurance seller itself were all sporting the same vertically integrated operating brand: the insurance sellers.  Its 100% end-use health care customer responsibility to verify the networking status of health care services/goods vendors prior to contact 100% of the time.

Yes. End-use health care customers are the default payer in payer pole position #1.

And you did consent to that financial responsibility.  >what to do  1. ~~Fight the insurance seller to increase its reimbursement to the vendor.~~ Bell already rung round already over.  2. Fight the vendor to decrease its payment demand from you.  3. Hire at your sole expense 3rd party fighters that will do one the other or both on your behalf for a cut of the savings. Step #1: invoke itemized/super bill spell and save your fighters a first punch.  4. Do none of the above and wait for the vendor to offload its receivables to a 3rd party debt servicer/buyer and fight that entity.

hmbc40l,red_river_wraith,11/27/2021,1,Getting married is the biggest financial decision you will make.

hmao8sj,el_rico_pavo_real,11/27/2021,1,Makes sense. I have $10K sitting here and I want to buy VTI. So instead of buying $10K worth of VTI today I will watch the price action and buy X amount over time so in the event of a bearish downturn I dont get bagged AF.   Thanks a lot for helping me better understand!
hmb6476,pownedju,11/27/2021,1,Sorry if it was unclear. My insurance is like $90. Car is about $240. I shopped around and that was the cheapest for my 2016 Scion FR-S with a spotless driving record for 12 years.
hmacu9q,RO489,11/27/2021,1,I think you should bump up that 401k. As others say houses come with more expenses than renting.    And ask that being said I dont think theres anything wrong with lifestyle creep. Isnt that kinda the point of earning more (unless youre a FIRE early retirement type)? Some the housing market is high I would buy a house you are comfortable to say in for 5-10 years. Following the 3x salary rule you should be comfortable increasing a bit but that depends on your other spending habits whether you plan to have kids (and whether youll have daycare expense or drop to a single income) etc.   The point is that your spending should match your priorities. If you enjoy travel and eating out or expensive hobbies you probably dont want to stretch for your mortgage.   Regarding the dont buy a house with gf just make sure you are clear on how rubs will be divided if you have to sell or break up and how expenses will work. You might want to get an attorney involved just to formalize things
hm9m5eq,CyberVolks,11/27/2021,0,Did you check your bank statements? The money gets debited from you somewhere. You can send a rent check through the mail and it could end up lost or stolen. Just because you sent the check doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre paid up. Auto pay is drawn from where you make your deposits. Chase is just proving the service. Check your bank.
hmazvmx,SAugsburger,11/27/2021,1,I would say if the match vests immediately then absolutely but if not I think you have to consider the long term probability of working there.
hmaslf7,ThekingofShibauni777,11/27/2021,1,Yes this a a common thing they do control you bank account pass off fake checks and transfer the money to there account and you get blaimed if that makes sense but if thats true that should be all on your bank for not catching it lawyer up if you need to
hmbdfuh,FutureBarrySeal,11/27/2021,1,Not a good idea‚Ä¶ especially in this market. If your bills are less than $500 a month and you can‚Äôt manage to save or pay down debt selling the car is only going to enable that behavior. Even if you did pay it down you‚Äôd just get yourself back in debt because you have no control. Here‚Äôs something you can try‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure those apps let you do instant cash out right? Every day you work and make Money cash out and put 70-80% of it towards debt immediately. Toss the other cards for now so you aren‚Äôt tempted to use them. You‚Äôll see the progress within a month and hopefully be motivated to pay it off. Take it from Some of us older folks you‚Äôre going down a bad path and you‚Äôre young enough to catch it young and fix it. You don‚Äôt want to wake up and be 40 one day with severe debt and no savings. Good luck

hmaw8ft,ThanksSoMuchTangelos,11/27/2021,1,If money was spent to improve the investment does that change anything? I.e. wed remodel the kitchen. Im guessing that is also considered an investment but wondering if it changes anything that it runs through as a business expense?

hmb3zc0,cahphoenix,11/27/2021,1,They did not. That is a common misconception. Clearances are paid for by the government.  Here is one source but if you search you can find many more. You cannot find sources that corroborate what you are saying. I was also employed at a couple federal contractors before moving to startups.  [https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs](https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs)  >How much does it cost to get a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL)?   >   >With very limited exceptions there is no direct charge to federal contractors for a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL). Government agencies receive appropriated funds to cover the cost of adjudicating security clearances and to pay an Investigation Service Provider like DCSA/NBIB for security clearance investigations. DCSA receives appropriated funds to pay for federal contractor clearance investigations and adjudications under the NISP. DCSA also receives appropriated funds to pay for security clearance adjudication for the military service departments and other DoD agencies.  Where ever you got that information it is almost certainly wrong as over 99% of all clearances are not paid for by the company (contractor). The company only incurs costs for maintaining the division/organization which keeps track of the clearances and clearance processes.
hmb9hjm,kjblank80,11/27/2021,1,The donation doesnt even have to be to a state agency.  There are likely private groups that buy land to keep it undeveloped/preserved.

hmb4j4e,reinvestments,11/27/2021,1,No it‚Äôs never too late. Some people don‚Äôt start until much later or never at all. The reason to invest your money is because of compounding interest. If you just save all of your money in a back account then you will be losing buying power due to inflation and missing out on potential gains from investments. Go read about the bogglehead approach to investing if you want some good and easy informing about what to do with your money.
hmbbbim,taku2472,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for this.  The lease document does not clarify the exact formula other than: sub-metering of all electric/water use and that 3rd party billing company if applicable: Conservice.  However at least it seems clear that my usage is not based on number of persons residing/occupancy/size of the unit (it is a small unit anyways)  In my lease document all it says regarding utility bills are the following:  water/electricity bills will be billed by the service provider to us and then allocated to you based on the following formula:1  Metering/allocation method key  1- Sub-metering of all of your water/gas/electric use  2- calcuation of your total water use based on sub-metering of hot water  3- Calculation of your total water use based on sub-metering of cold water  4- flat rate per month  5- Allocation based on the number of persons residing in your apartment  6- allocation based on the number of persons residing in your apartment using a ratio occupancy formula  7- Allocation based on square footage of your apartment  8- Allocation based on a combination of square footage of your apartment and the number of persons residing in your apartment  9- Allocation based on the number of bedrooms in your apartment  10- Allocation based on a lawful formula not listed here.
hmazt7y,Pemi1099,11/27/2021,1,Im not sure a written contract gets you out of this case. Anyone can sue anyone for anything. Despite the contract she can still claim the the agreement was unlawful as they were married in the eyes of the law therefore she actually owns a portion of the house. It would probably come to the same result (nothing) but would still cost money.  I think a better protection would just be to document all expenses. That way if shit hits the fan you at least know what youve got into it and no one truly loses.

hmb3qs8,Earthquake14,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the perspective. Unfortunately anything lower than 200k in our area is either really tiny in a really bad neighborhood or will require a ton of work all of which are dealbreakers for us.

hmaa30d,silkysilkk,11/27/2021,1,Absolutely. The finance office at a dealership is a black box if you are not familiar with what goes on. The less information they provide you the greater the leverage for them. If you can provide details Id be happy to help. Im guessing they went over the money factor and residual with you? The good news is Hondas maintain their value so if the auto industry keeps trending the way it is you may be able to get out of your lease early and get another car that may be within the price point that is comfortable for you.
hmbb5uu,PurpleParrotFish,11/27/2021,1,Not really if you haven‚Äôt combined money it really isn‚Äôt wise to use both savings accounts for a new car to share for example. Also my religion does not allow for living together unmarried.
hmahma1,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,There is also a ton of hate about Chase BOFA etc.   Ive been with PNC for a few years and see them as any other mega-bank. They are fine.    I wouldnt bother switching from one mega to another mega. They are not that different.  I miss my local credit union.
hm9xgs7,Neatguyonline,11/27/2021,1,What starting salary are you using for the CS degree?  This looks like 6 years in you‚Äôre estimating 80k?  That is very very conservative.  A lot of CS majors make more than that day 1 out of school.
hmbcy0r,Hexcyn,11/27/2021,1,Drivable doesnt mean it wont be totaled. Source: my car was damaged while parked and I didnt notice until I had driven a few miles. I drove to the body shop and then called my insurance (learning experience - call them first). The car was still totaled. Cost of repairs was more than 75% of the value on a $6k car. Insurance paid for the value of the car and a rental for a week or two while I scrambled to get a replacement.
hmauad5,Lollc,11/27/2021,1,He totally has way more of an emergency fund than I and most of my peers had.  But its not under his control.  He could be cut off tomorrow for any reason or no reason.  Ive seen it happen IRL.
hmag01o,jaybetterman,11/27/2021,1,Again it sounds like your decision has already been made.   Rephrase - how do I get myself into a house with a ton of debt w/o putting much down but also I want the benefit of being on the mortgage just in case I get divorced.   The point of the 20% is also to make sure you‚Äôre both sure. It‚Äôs easy to sign some papers for 3.5% but actually saving sacrificing and THEN handing over the 50k means you‚Äôre sure. Even if you don‚Äôt pay down your student debt totally taking the time to get even 10% down would be smart.   Clearly you want to do this together but have doubts about being protected. That should be a red flag enough to hold off.    For example say a homeowner with a FICO credit score higher than 760 borrowed $100000 that equated to 92% of the value of the home they purchased. If their mortgage lender took out a policy to cover 35% of the $100000 loan amount the borrowers PMI premium would be 2.56% of that amount or $2560.

How old is the roof the ac/heater kitchen appliances etc.  You may think you‚Äôre getting a deal but with the way homes are selling some people could be unloading before they are hit with massive improvement costs. Need to look at that closely.
hmbasq4,ArianaGonerreah,11/27/2021,1,Glengarry Glen Ross. She filled out a sweepstakes card and was harassed by The Machine until she caved.
hmb3m47,Delta080,11/27/2021,1,Selling your car and using it to pay down your debt won‚Äôt help your problem of overspending. You need to learn to be responsible with your money and stay within your means.
hmaxfrg,Blah12821,11/27/2021,1,If you had asked for a cashiers check there likely wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue.   It would have also been good idea to give them a little notice. Especially if they are a smaller local bank. Banks don‚Äôt keep tons of cash on hand.
hmb0rka,Veertjeveertje,11/27/2021,1,Depends.   What is your current financial situation? Do you need the money or is it extra? What is your risk appetite? And so on.   Mostly investing is a trade-off between risk/ volatility and expected returns.
hma047b,yeah87,11/27/2021,1,What do you owe on the condo? Im assuming the $300/mo is after paying the mortgage because if its not you need to sell it immediately.
hmb42rg,Quality_Manager,11/27/2021,1,Is there any way they can avoid taxes?
hm9p568,52Lewis20Reed,11/27/2021,1,Yeah good point lol. Im just being extra stingy right now but youre right-- if Im not willing to pull out the stocks now when would I ever be willing? I got a long way to go before I hit that retirement age.   And thats a question I had that I shouldve posted- do I get taxed at all for the money I take out in retirement if I utilize the loan system? FWIW aside from the money Ive put into the account the gains Ive made on my retirement account are pretty insignificant.
hma7w7k,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,Youve done nothing wrong.  Follow u/DeluxeXLs guidance.  This commenter likely means well but is misinformed and thus is providing suboptimal advice.

hmaucw0,Orangesunset98,11/27/2021,1,I know door dash has certain requirements for cars you are able to drive  working for them I highly doubt you‚Äôll find a car with that standard at $3k especially in this market. My car with a broken bumper and high mileage is worth $6.5k right now so I do not think it would be the best option to get a car

hmamoqx,el_rico_pavo_real,11/27/2021,1,Ok so DCA is nothing more than the average price paid over the course of the investment. Makes sense.

hmbbthb,CQME,11/27/2021,1,>investing probably makes sense.  Im of the opinion that investing in something like TIPS makes sense...but if anyone is going into the stock market they need to understand that the stock markets performance over the past 12 years or so to say nothing about its performance since the early 80s is way above average.  Law of averages reversion to mean whatever you want to call it would dictate that in order to average out this multi-decade boom will have to be tempered by a multi-decade decline.  There have been several of these over the past 100 years so its certainly possible and we are long overdue for one.  The return on TIPS is probably going to be around where mortgage rates are today maybe a bit lower.  Its a better alternative to cash and it allows you to take advantage of current mortgage rates without getting hit too hard by inflation.
hmb7cmw,jorge1209,11/27/2021,1,Because you didnt set up a rollover so they dont know that you will roll it into an IRA. For all they know you will take that money down to the casino and blow it on the craps table.  You have a ticking clock on this and need to get the money into an IRA within 60 days so dont delay setting up your IRA and depositing that check.

hm9f2vl,k-tax,11/27/2021,7,Why? In my whole European life I have never had an issue with an instantly settled transaction. Why an outdated heterogenous system would be better than modern and unified system?   Credit card transactions are settled instantly and I dont see any issue here. But Ive heard that people in the US are giving their credit card details to be written down or even give them by phone so maybe there are differences here too.
hma31lc,invenio78,11/27/2021,1,We have 4 lines with Ting and its about a quarter of what you pay.
hmavxmt,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,Perfectly acceptable. If you need to manipulate your utilization (while it is a big part of a score it isnt a lasting part: most models only care about the last reported utilization from each account) you can make extra mid-cycle payments.
hm9yjm2,DeluxeXL,11/27/2021,1,> I have downloaded several apps. Schwab Fidelity Stash M1.   Those are real brokerages who publish software apps. They are not just apps.  > I really liked lay out of M1 however my credit union wasn‚Äôt compatible.   Its rare to have an [ACH blacklist](https://support.m1finance.com/hc/en-us/articles/220989888-Banks-that-M1-supports). Id say its M1 thats incompatible. Its also the only one in the list that doesnt accept check deposits.  For long term investing its probably better to go with an established company.

hma4u3a,altmud,11/27/2021,1,Equity participation of any kind (including RSUs) is inherently a gamble.  Thats the nature of them and everyone knows that.  I doubt youll get very far attempting to come up with some grand argument about how little they might worth.  This is no different than any other compensation negotiation.  Youre going to have to argue the great value you bring to the company or that you could get more somewhere else or how the offer is less than the going rate for someone of your experience in your position.  Things like that.  You can mention that the offered RSU amount isnt enough to compel you to join as part of that negotiation.  But I dont think focusing on doomsday events where the company is possibly going to fail and they will be worth little or nothing is going to be a very motivating argument (or endear you to them).
hma3a6i,tired_of_username,11/27/2021,1,Why would you want to make a 30 year commitment to buy a house together if you cant make a marriage commitment?  Someone in the relationship is living a lie.

hmapr7f,levans1717,11/27/2021,1,Land is absolutely one of the best things you can own especially with the low property taxes. That wetland might not be wetland later down the road but even so hunters might be interested in leasing it especially if it connects to conservation land.

hmbhnbd,red_river_wraith,11/27/2021,1,Most people dont understand the long term drag of fees over time.  Investment costs and advisor fees may seem miniscule at first blush however over time they compound just like your investment returns.  Not only do you lose small amounts from fees but more importantly you lose all the growth potential that you might have had for years into the future due to fees.  Find an online investment calculator and input your data with and without fees over a 20 or 30 year period I think you will be shocked at the difference.
hmavzl4,Getmybaby,11/27/2021,1,Never agree to an automatic renewal. If you gave that permission in the original lease then let them know that you intend to let the lease expire.  Next time you sign a less contract sign it all rights reserved. Hidden contracts are a real thing.  That being said call the lease manager and find out if you can negotiate.
hm91f3n,applepiecorgi,11/27/2021,1,I would consider special assessments. This happened to my parents after they bought a condo - I think it was a foundation issue that needed to be addressed/ wasn‚Äôt known at the time they bought.   Also increased property taxes. Our property taxes went up 70% last year which I‚Äôm honestly kind of peeved about because our school district sucks we have one street light on our entire street and no sidewalks. But it added a bit more to our mortgage.   Plus the possibility that HOA fees rise. In my home state most condos are already charging an arm and a leg for maintenance fees.
hm9fh9c,Naive-Inspection,11/27/2021,1,no because this cc has an annual fee Ive never applied for a cc w/ an annual fee
hmayctd,nothlit,11/27/2021,1,Have you tried using the [IRS withholding estimator](https://www.irs.gov/w4app) tool?  For the worksheet you should use your federal taxable income so number 2 in your list basically. Whatever would show up in box 1 of your W-2.

hm92mtu,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,1,Hi! 29f making 120k. This is exactly what everyone our age should be going for retirement. Please do not dial back.   If you are looking at short term success then opening a brokerage account and investing in index funds makes sense. Bitcoin is risky and uncharted. Cool for fun here and there though.   Good luck!
hmb2lec,Zootallurs,11/27/2021,1,Sell the current home and redeploy your capital to a proper investment property. The rent-to-value ratio is too far out of whack. You either won‚Äôt cash flow will have terrible Return on Equity or both. Bonus that your capital gains will be exempt if you sell now.
hm92gun,dequeued,11/27/2021,1,This is better suited for /r/Advice.
hmbgop4,toodlesandpoodles,11/27/2021,1,If your goal for saving is to save as much as as possible youll never reach it and always be miserable. You need to sit down and determine what you are saving money for the sacrifices you are making to do it and whether or not it is worth it.  I grew up saving money for college and spending very little and when I started working I shifted to saving money for retirement. Initially I didnt have a well-defined goal of what this meant. This made it difficult for me to spend any money. Once I decided the age I wanted to retire how much money I needed to retire at this age and what I would need to save for it to conservatively grow to this amount then I felt freed up to just spend any extra money.
hmalg5m,gar862,11/27/2021,1,20% down payment has nothing to do with both being sure about the purchase it‚Äôs what‚Äôs mortgage companies would willingly risk back in the day and times have changed thus now allowing lower down payment amounts.
hmaco4l,twilightmarchon,11/27/2021,1,I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily listen to the above advice. Target date funds begin to limit risk as you approach retirement age. This reduces potential reward (so you might not make as much with the money) but makes sure you don‚Äôt lose everything if there‚Äôs a crash right when you retire. You need to carefully consider your risk tolerance before making this change. That said you have 17 years before you intend to retire so have some time for the market to rebound if it falls.
hmay3js,hellohellos,11/27/2021,1,generally and i mean generally when people reference things as a percentage of income they mean before taxes. because thats the number you know. but often people build budgets and try and hit numbers with their post tax monthly salary.
hma3yat,Pezpal,11/27/2021,1,The ones I‚Äôve wored with do. I‚Äôve seen them question a buyer about the $80 he withdraws from his account every week and find out that‚Äôs his weed money. They didn‚Äôt care they were looking for an actual financial obligation but they ask about patterns of spending for sure.  That‚Äôs how they decide whether you‚Äôre a good risk or not. If you‚Äôre regularly spending money on hookers and meth you‚Äôre probably not getting a mortgage.
hmb18sr,SolutionLeading,11/27/2021,1,The amount depends on the usage of everyone in his community though
hma5rk5,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,VIG underperformed the total market so unless you have some specific portfolio goal I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôd pick it
hmbmjmu,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,Not sure how you pulled your scores but I just want to emphasize that a credit report is not the same thing as a credit score.   A credit report basically shows a history of any credit lines you currently have or have had in the past as well as your payment history for each. Credit scores (like the most often referred to FICO score) are calculated based on applying proprietary formulas to the data contained within your credit report. A 10-20 point difference between scores calculated by different agencies isnt that odd but I would be concerned seeing 30+ point differences.
hmaa34d,Mikemtb09,11/27/2021,1,You can do non-arms length transactions for $1 in most US states. There may be some tax but it would still be way cheaper than purchasing or dealing with cases of extreme debt.

hma76ac,TK_TK_,11/27/2021,1,This is the silliest view people have on marriage. Who cares if you have a romantic view on it or not‚Äîit‚Äôs a legal contract that confers a huge amount of benefits. If you have a partner you want to get a mortgage with you should get married first. If you don‚Äôt want to marry someone you don‚Äôt want to buy a house with them.
hmb7w28,terpischore761,11/27/2021,1,No you won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the nature of the industry. Just be honest and polite about turning the job down.   It‚Äôs business not personal.
hmaaii3,Mikemtb09,11/27/2021,1,10 years is insane. In US you can ‚Äúsell‚Äù it for $1 and pay transfer taxes/fees etc depending on the state. It would be called a non-arms length transaction but there are legal legit ways to do it that are far cheaper than purchasing it at market value and not being in trouble for fraud.
hmbict5,Joloven,11/27/2021,1,True. Say when you say signicantlu less affordable than what Im doing now what sort of math are we looking at realistically?  I think for now. My short term goal needs to be to earn more so our income is 3x our rent plus utilities. Once that is achieved if we are frugal we can save up.

hmb3ye0,Riza101z,11/27/2021,1,That‚Äôs very true I didn‚Äôt think about that. Considering we grew up in an abusive home my sister probably wants to make sure if anything goes wrong she can support herself.
hmaul0d,Legitimate_Youth_524,11/27/2021,1,In this scenario I would use a check.
hmawn49,Rubily00,11/27/2021,1,0% Apr credit card is not bad as long as you can guarantee youll pay it off completely before the 0% expires.  For most people getting a personal unsecured loan for $10k will be difficult if not impossible. And even if you can the rates are not likely to be as favorable as a loan thats backed by an asset. So if a 0% card doesnt work for you a home equity loan is probably your next best option.
hm952al,gammaradiation2,11/27/2021,1,Hmmmm I suppose the bill of sale should have said market equivalent value and the parents sent cash on a marry-go-round.
hmb6p87,shadow_chance,11/27/2021,1,Are you afraid of something specific related to money? I see your mindset with people who grew up poor(ish). Theyre just constantly in a scarcity mindset. If you have some harsh childhood trauma around money maybe you need therapy. That will obviously cost money so youd have to bite the bullet.   Your take home is what? 5K/month? And youre only spending 1000? Not sure how thats possible in VHCOL without 10 roommates.   Did you ever think that maybe you could make *more* money in your life if you had a calmer living situation? More confidence from better skin and clothes?   Finally most of the stuff you mentioned is really not *that* expensive usually. At least not if you just buy a bit at a time. Clothes? Youre in a big city Im assuming so Uniqlo is great for affordable basics. Banana Republic is almost always 50%+ off and has fine business casual office clothes. Skin? You probably have decent health insurance if you make 130K. *Go to a dermatologist.* Thats maybe a couple hundred if you havent met your deductible. For scarring a retinoid is your friend (probably). Differin is over the counter for like $12 and a tube should last a month.
hmb9qtc,memepeasant,11/27/2021,1,I second this. It sounds really interesting and something Id like to learn more about too
hma12j0,yeah87,11/27/2021,1,Also worth noting that this type of mortgage insurance becomes less valuable as time goes on because your payoff price goes down over time. Its generally advisable to simply get a standalone life or disability insurance product.
hmawf6z,shadow9494,11/27/2021,1,The tax benefits for conservation lands are incredible. Probably what I‚Äôd do but speak to a tax expert first.

hmar91c,Donzulu,11/27/2021,1,I‚Äôve just put all my raises into my 401k. 6 raises later I finally hit my max and my take home as been the same for a few years because of this.  That is a good start and you can go from there

hmabg75,not-now-im-redditing,11/27/2021,1,I haven‚Äôt looked at all of the comments so if this has been addressed then please forgive me. What does her debt situation look like? The investing advice so far sounds solid but if she‚Äôs buried in credit card bills those need to be paid off to free up her cash flow. Retirement funds should be based on her expenses. Reduce her expenses and you reduce the amount of money she needs.
hm9stvh,dadading_dadadoom,11/27/2021,2,Then likely they did a withdrawal. Maybe they have a less than $1000 policy.    Option A is to rollover you need documentation add exact missing amount to move to IRA within 60 days. At tax time net the tax amount (since tax on 401k already withheld you can expect that to be credited).  https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/rollover-faq   Option B is to take the hit penalty is 10% + calcated tax.
hma6umg,tired_of_username,11/27/2021,1,Thats what I thought.  You want the benefit of using someone elses money/credit to make an investment without a commitment.  Look I dont care how you live your life.  Just own it.  Such arrangements always end badly.  At least with a marriage the obligations when things fall apart is in a standard contract governed mostly by law.  If you arent living under a marriage contract you will one day be paying large sums of money to a lawyer to sort out the mess.

hmaxbq3,ricksebak,11/27/2021,1,I write this with the assumption that you‚Äôre looking to programmatically analyze your own data for your own personal benefit as opposed to programmatically analyzing data for a fintech startup that you are starting‚Ä¶  With that assumption in mind I suspect that what you‚Äôre looking for doesn‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôve looked around myself and haven‚Äôt found anything. It‚Äôs not really in the interest of a bank/broker to offer API access to its customers because doing so is 1) a lot of time/money 2) a liability that their compliance team doesn‚Äôt want and 3) won‚Äôt gain them any significant amount of customers because very few people even know what an API is and even less people will switch banks based on API‚Äôs.   There are API‚Äôs that offer the kind of data that you‚Äôre looking for such as Yodlee (which is what Personal Capital uses) but they‚Äôre marketed to FinTech‚Äôs not consumers.  Probably the best way to programmatically access your own data would be browser scraping (Selenium or whatever) rather than a proper API.

hma83h4,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,As the (twist on) old saying goes: best time to start investment is 20 years ago. Second best time is today.   Despite my best intentions and plans I found myself in a fairly similar position at about the same age.   As you help her (as much as she will allow) remember that she isnt really investing for the short term. Yes she might be working past 67 thats 14 years from now. Beyond that is the rest of her life which has a statistically significant change of being to age 90 (better than 20%).    Even 14 years is what most financial advisors would deem long-term but with a life expectancy of 25-45 years *definitely* taking a long-term mindset is appropriate. She isnt planning on just getting *to* retirement she is planning for the rest of her life.  She has until April 15th (or when she files taxes) to make a contribution to an IRA for 2021 so it isnt necessary to put too much pressure to do something NOW. Also what she does over next decade+ is more important that what she does this very minute.    Sounds like your Mom has set a good example for you now you can do the same by starting your own retirement you can share what you learn back to her. How to read a statement how to track investments etc.
hm9a5xb,contact_lens_linux,11/27/2021,3,Tell him youll only take it at the agreed upon terms otherwise tell him to cancel it.  Id rather keep the Lexus than deal with a liar
hmbehcd,blipsman,11/27/2021,1,He isn‚Äôt a registered charity it‚Äôs just a gift
hmb0wpk,Kickstand8604,11/27/2021,1,Agreed with many responses. Wetlands are very valuable and an organization such as The Nature Conservancy can help
hmau01r,nouseforanametoday,11/27/2021,1,Can you let parents know at the daycare you work at? I wouldnt care if someone brought their kids along to baby for me.  In my area- which is NOT a high COLA area babysitters are getting paid $15 an hour under the table for two kids. $12 for one.
hm91xec,russ257,11/27/2021,1,Do you have a car right now? What shape is it in?
hmaiurc,raznog,11/27/2021,1,Oh I have many great stories too. But they all stopped a few years back. As of about 4 years ago everything went from amazing to very lackluster but they still have their high prices. There was a time I was okay with the extra cost because I knew they were good for it. Not so much anymore.   And a bank returning money due to fraud is t exactly unique to usaa. That‚Äôs a bare minimum requirement for a bank.
hmagbcq,styrofoam_cups,11/27/2021,1,Would reconsider what you need for an emergency. Hopefully 60k is on the larger side. Invest some of that and keep on what you need in savings. With current situation regarding inflation - your losing money keeping it in a savings account
hmbbcf0,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,Sounds like a great trip! Southern Chile is breathtaking. Highly recommend the O Circuit in Torres del Paine!   A one night trip by bus from Puerto Natales over into Argentina to see the Perito Moreno is also worth it IMO.
hmbaiec,thememeconnoisseurig,11/27/2021,1,Absolutely- I put a subscription on each of them and I rotate through them when making daily purchases. The ridiculous APRs on all my cards would make it highway robbery if I let them get a dime in interest and I am too frugal to get into anything I couldnt pay off on my credit cards.
hmakiab,Salty_Peak8156,11/27/2021,1,Yea and just for reference the card hasnt even come in the mail yet. So I dont think itll hurt the average age of my accounts? And the limit on it is FAR less than my other card
hm9nuuj,knightofsolarisbos,11/27/2021,4,I dont know what country youre in but In most western countries its illegal for someone under 18 to work that late.  A lot about this guy seems wrong.
hmb9h9y,lig710,11/27/2021,1,This would depend on your family dynamic but it could be worth talking with your mom about the situation (even though it could be a fairly uncomfortable conversation).  Maybe the plane tickets are refundable or maybe someone else could use them?  IMO if you have a destination wedding you have to go into that knowing not everyone can spend thousands of dollars to come.  I make $35k/year and also could not handle an unexpected $2k expense without making a big dent in my savings something Im not very comfortable doing for a non-emergency.  It sounds like she is already aware money is tight for you and would hopefully understand.
hmauw4f,diatho,11/27/2021,1,This is universal. If you select Roth 401k the employer portion will go into a traditional 401k. The company can not prepay the taxes like you can for the Roth.
hmbdrd5,KCL2001,11/27/2021,1,Potentially but if you need to reduce that risk a post-nuptial agreement could help separate the assets again.
hmb9laj,baudinl,11/27/2021,1,The key is to have the money go straight to somewhere other than your checking account. You may want to consider contributing more to your 401k (5% isnt very much)

hm98yyu,okiechuckd,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for the response! So just text him back and say something like ‚Äòwe signed everything we needed to sign. Next time focus on the paperwork‚Äô?
hmae374,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,How would that work? Im just not getting this. Why wouldnt you max out a roth ira now at 12% when you could pyt more into a 401(k) when we eventually (ideally) just up a tax bracket? Why pay more taxes later on a 401(k)?
hmaku8b,Woody1918,11/27/2021,1,This is great stuff!! Thank you everyone I now have a new place to start and maybe make some positive changes!
hmavygm,DG_momma2,11/27/2021,1,This is pretty standard for most banks both for the cash withdrawal and the check.
hm9bmkz,PM_ME_YOUR_CALICOS,11/27/2021,3,This happens and it sucks that it happened to you.   If youre worried about them just doing this to switch the loan ask him how he messed up the miles. I knew our dealership finance manager well and it happened and he was the least malicious or sales-y finance guy Ive met. They are human beings and as such make mistakes which sucks when it happens to you but isnt malicious.  We had people type the miles in and I know of one sake where it was typed in like 53000 and the car had 56000. We caught it and resubmitted the deal before they signed but I know the bank bumped it from like 2.14% to 2.19%.  Any finance manager worth a damn would not risk unraveling a sale to get whatever the commission difference may be. If he wanted to shop this to banks the time was before you signed. Id chalk this up to be a genuine mistake.
hmbap2u,thememeconnoisseurig,11/27/2021,1,Income is high credit is still very low. Total credit limits are approximately 10% of income. I have been focusing on increasing my credit limits the last couple months.  Thanks for the reply!
hmaq6xw,veloharris,11/27/2021,1,Are you retiring tomorrow? You dont need that money for probably 30+ years you do nothing.
hm9pa7l,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,3,>but I guess I‚Äôd like to know when one should be worried about their investment.  If youre in a target date fund you shouldnt.  Stock market goes up in the long term.  Short term fluctuations dont matter.     >How do you guys cope?!  Dont look at it regularly.
hmawdqi,BlasphemousButler,11/27/2021,1,For $25/year why not just hang on to it?  Sounds like there is no upkeep necessary and you have a 5 acre plot in the middle of the country where you could have family reunions or run around naked or just take a nice quiet nap (Im assuming its very rural based on the value).  Even though nothing can be built on it it still could be used in valuable ways.
hmafp0u,zludderz4707,11/27/2021,1,That‚Äôs exactly the question I asked myself when I got this call - why let the risk roll off the lot before you even obtain the profits? Granted I was at a dealership that had papers signed and cars sold every 5 minutes.

hmbaa4x,taurusfeeling,11/27/2021,1,1. Call first and see if they‚Äôll waive the overdraft if you pay a certain amount toward the balance  2. Imo yes pay as much debt as you can now if it‚Äôs high interest debt (over 4-5%).  Paying off debt is almost like a guaranteed return. You can continue to average into crypto while paying off your remaining debts. It will be here for awhile and the market is just growing.  The mental ease from having little or no debt and the freedom to invest your extra cash as you see fit is worth it. Just my 2¬¢
hmbk131,PileofScrabbleTiles,11/27/2021,1,Yup just a discussion although the new account would start getting our monthly savings contributions.  We just moved into a new home this May and had to dip into the fund two weeks after buying when the 20 year old washer leaked into our first floor ceiling. Needless to say that scared us a bit so I think well go with the two accounts one for legit savings the other for easy access.  Thanks for the help!
hmat6x3,93195,11/27/2021,1,Either way.  I like paying it off right away to keep utilization low but as long as you‚Äôre paying the whole balance before the due date you won‚Äôt pay interest which is the important thing.
hmbentx,buildyourown,11/27/2021,1,Absolutely jointly.  You can do them both ways to prove it to yourself
hm8xu06,CDMOlde,11/27/2021,204,Bingo. Give it 5 days of quiet investigation to gather a no brainer case and pick up their accomplices on the way. Then ice cream üòé
hm9wr63,UMfan11244,11/27/2021,1,So there are a few answers.   First get the match no matter what. Then open a Roth IRA (Fidelity would be great). Once the Roth IRA is maxed work toward hitting the annual limit for the 401(k) which is $20.5k for 2022.   I could expand and say you should get a HDHP with an HSA account but that‚Äôs completely on you.
hm906mu,Phoenix2683,11/27/2021,5,I was thinking that but how would they know who the customers are and that they saw that teller that day specifically.  Occams razor says its him
hmb6vr1,TodaysMenace,11/27/2021,1,They‚Äôre big in banks who lend to farmers.
hm9rkph,swampler22,11/27/2021,1,Well that sucks. And thats whats confusing to me. If its my 401k which is pre tax why would they tax this amount and then proceed to give it to me. Why not just leave the full amount?
hmadcaq,AsOctoberFalls,11/27/2021,1,Yes $2300 is high IMO. The USDA‚Äôs ‚Äúliberal‚Äù grocery budget is $220/week for a family of two adults and a one year old.  I feel we spend a lot on groceries and eating out. We are feeding two adults and a 10 year old and we spend roughly $750/month on groceries and $300/month eating out. I am able to buy pretty much whatever specialty ingredients I want with this budget (although I have noticed that getting more difficult with rising grocery costs lately).
hmau019,okaywhattho,11/27/2021,1,Seems like a no brainer at $25 a year in taxes.
hm9wpcq,aaaaij,11/27/2021,1,How much to save can be a complicated question as can how much to save through Roth accounts but you definitely dont want to save 100% Roth your entire career so maybe start there - why do you have / want both a Roth 401k and a Roth IRA? What pre-tax money do you already have saves or when do you plan on saving some pre-tax money?
hm91xit,unlistedname,11/27/2021,3,Take the $1500 best money youll get for a salvage title that needs probably its full value in repairs and cant pass inspections.   Might be able to take it out of state or trade it in but doubt youd get more than the $1500 since its got a salvage title needs repairs and has a low book value as is. Also Im not 100% sure its legal to sell a car that doesnt meet inspection there or to take it out of state to bypass those laws.   Repairing it would set you at $900 profit given the values you did but I think the numbers are high for what youd get out so its not worth it.
hmbifv4,2021istrash,11/27/2021,1,The problem isnt the wedding its that you will also want a baby or accidentally  get pregnant. Then you will have to stay at home caring for the baby and you will be baby trapped. Why? Because right after college and a few years after you probably wont make much money and you will be fully depending on your husband making money and therefore be trapped financially. No woman or man should ever be trapped that way unable to leave a bad relationship because of money  Everyone should have a certain degree of financial freedom before and during the marriage. Sure once can take 6mo maternity leave and rely on them for a bit but realistically your career wont take off right after college and getting married and much less is having a baby early on.  Also its nice to have some savings for emergencies in case one of you falls sick and for proper vacations. If you want to ruin a marriage fast being broke and having a baby early on are the easiest ways to do this.
hmbk366,Undercovergreen,11/27/2021,1,Its pretty east for you to check what it would cost from another provider. That said its not crazy for you to be paying that at your age if its comprehensive
hmbkqor,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,OP can you see your meter (or is it locked on your building)?  Turn everything off in your apartment and look at the meter. Is it still spinning like a carnival whirly-bird ride?
hm9yvbj,woodworkerForLyfe,11/27/2021,1,IRA.  Buy schd get more monthly income and reinvest dividends.  Make more than mortgage interest
hmb6dpw,Rough-Ground6141,11/27/2021,1,Def not true. I make my student loan payments monthly. Never put into deferment. That‚Äôs a choice. I would contact your SL provider immediately. This smells of fraud.
hm9ujv8,ihavereddit2021,11/27/2021,1,I would consider whether its really worth putting down 20%. Debt is still cheap in the mortgage market. An investment only needs to make ~3% to out pace your mortgage rate.  You could put down 5% keep the remaining ~$45k in your investments and likely make well over whatever youd save in mortgage interest.
hma3ku8,football35249,11/27/2021,1,You absolutely need to get it out of the tow yard
hm8yvyv,AgentM2,11/27/2021,2,The fact you‚Äôre 17 and already asking these questions is leaps ahead of most 40 year olds
hmb3uwx,NYNBKFarSuperior,11/27/2021,1,it had federal at 12.30% state at 4.60% and local which I assume is NYC tax at 3.18%

hm8x7lr,cdurbin3,11/27/2021,894,This OP. Im an Internal Auditor for a bank. You need to report this asap. You can see if the bank has a way to report complaints on their website they probably do or call and try to talk to someone in the compliance department.
hmalnnp,sektrONE,11/27/2021,1,One thing I always emphasize to people is that when you buy a house as long as you‚Äôre accounting for the additional repairs utilities taxes etc. you also should remember that a portion of your payment is principal on your mortgage and growing your equity.  This means that at worst (assuming the market doesn‚Äôt tank) you‚Äôre effectively putting that portion into savings and at best it‚Äôs appreciating significantly. So it‚Äôs not all sunk costs like your rent.  I‚Äôm not saying to look at a personal residence as an investment just that your principal payment shouldn‚Äôt be looked at as a pure expense IMO.
hmbbjnl,BruceCourteous4444,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for the recommendation. Is it actually good to own a share of S&P 500? Do you have any other recommendations? Do you have a mutual fund portfolio that I can replicate?
hmbl96l,Stoic_Chief,11/27/2021,1,Yeah that seems to be the strategy. Fortunately I just discovered that there are some apartments in my area that will give me discounts on rent since they are partnered with my employer. From what Ive seen I might not pay what I was paying before but I can save at least $100 dollars off my rent.
hmbd0lc,I__Know__Stuff,11/27/2021,1,The estate absolutely is responsible for debts of the decedent. Im not sure how you avoided it in your situation.

hmb58yo,ImHereBcuzUBrokeIt,11/27/2021,1,So why did grandma own 5 acres of wetlands in Wisconsin? I love the idea of making conservation land but I‚Äôd be kinda curious what grandma was thinking‚Ä¶
hmakr0r,el_rico_pavo_real,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for this response.   Can you please expand on your last comment about if youre not holding back money today youre not doing DCA. ?   Essentially I buy VTI once or twice per month.
hmb87mw,VegasOldPerv,11/27/2021,1,Have her get out of a traditional retail setting. A wholesale club like Sams Club a mail order pharmacy or learning med center/ hospital Rx. All can be less stressful than a retail chain like Rite Aid or CVS. Even a specialty compounding pharmacy would be less stressful and more interesting.   Pharmacy techs are in demand. Show her all the job listings in her area. Hopefully that can boost her confidence with all the experience she has.
hma4kc0,ReaverKS,11/27/2021,1,Is the other persons insurance going to play games if I‚Äôve managed to move my vehicle from the tow yard before they decide what they‚Äôre going to do? I.e maybe they claim the car isn‚Äôt totaled since I drove it home or something like that? I assumed the car is totaled since the air bags deployed and the door is completely smashed in
hmb7m41,MadMarioMax,11/27/2021,1,Youre telling me to not assume meanwhile you are assuming that they arent able to call.  Her post literally says Should I call?
hmavf1y,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,You definitely need to know this:   1. you are doing okay! 2. keep remembering #1 (ie the above plus implying care for yourself)   Life is a marathon not a sprint. I cant tell you that you are absolutely doing too many things or just enough.     As an old fart I applaud keeping something as a side gig. Its a mind expander and helps develop the attitude that you are never stuck doing XYZ because thats all youve ever known and done.    Also it gives you a great perspective on what it takes to run a business how its multifaceted. The more you understand how the pieces (people money time management risk) work together the more valuable you are to any business.
hm9jy33,ljaffe19,11/27/2021,1,Thank you this is something to consider. Another thing I didn‚Äôt mention is that I have kids with stuff to lug around for them and having more cargo space is also important to me. The Camry is a nice sedan but I don‚Äôt feel that it‚Äôs currently meeting my needs right now
hmaxzs0,zacce,11/27/2021,1,Dealers advertise low price in internet. But charge a higher price at the shop. Unfortunately standard practice these days.
hmbgm6m,Ferret_Faama,11/27/2021,1,This is something people always vastly underestimate. There are so many random expenses that it always costs more than you can easily account for on paper.
hmagd5c,Educational_Author13,11/27/2021,1,so they can just grab it out of my account i texted my boss im waiting for a response i dont wanna get suedüíÄ
hm909hc,atxcats,11/27/2021,3,What the teller did was a fireable offense and he knew it. I worked in a field (not banking) where we had a duty to keep confidential information confidential and we were forbidden to access this information unless it was necessary for us to do our jobs. We had yearly training to remind us that we could be repremanded or fired for accessing this information for no legitimate reason.  OP would not be ruining the tellers life and he may be preventing other people from being contacted by this teller who is using confidential information as his own personal address book.
hmbhhtj,BeetsbySasha,11/27/2021,1,Yes. It needs to be in a good range. I‚Äôm overall happy with what I bought but I recognize that we could have increased our budget. Now we just spend our house money on renovating slowly.
hmbn1f9,Stoic_Chief,11/27/2021,1,Yeah I looked over the lease agreement - youre correct.
hmbr82c,Johnny09876,11/27/2021,1,Assuming you can find a house yourself whats the difference?  Dont forget typically the realtor is working for the seller. Use your mother-in-law to submit the offer.

hmawdkj,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,Thank you! That was exactly my point especially since /u/Morepaperplease said their goal was to max both a 401k Roth and standard 401k.
hmbpw8z,danielv123,11/27/2021,1,Yeah that is 0.25% a year.
hmbe2u8,ecmcn,11/27/2021,1,Nature Conservancy is a great organization. They‚Äôre at least worth talking to about the options.
hmacxna,prettyplum32,11/27/2021,1,Marriage is simply a contract where you combine two people into one legal unit.   This means for taxes it‚Äôs not your income it‚Äôs both of your income (although you can also file married separately). This means you have access to each other‚Äôs benefits at work. It means you have automatic beneficiary designations for life insurance/retirement accounts/medical and end of life decisions. It means anything bought (big stuff like houses worthless stuff like silverware) legally belong to both of you.   Marriage itself is not expensive or cheap it completely depends on your own situations. Some people end up paying more in taxes after marriage some end up paying less. Some people‚Äôs spouses take out credit cards in their name in secret some people‚Äôs spouses are financially literate. It just totally depends.   The fact that you‚Äôve asked this to me means you don‚Äôt have the requisite life experience needed to decide who and when to marry yet. Move in together if you want live as actual adults for a while before you decide. Marriage is very easy to do and very very expensive to undo. You don‚Äôt want to rush into it.
hmbd864,The_Band_Geek,11/27/2021,1,As bank I was disappointed with them more than once. As a CC provider theyre great. One of the better no-annual-fee rewards cards out there.
hmbkmh8,Undercovergreen,11/27/2021,1,The difference of $50 isnt a lot and you need to see what the exact specs of your current insurance are. ie deductible/liability coverage.
hm92gkb,SnooCauliflowers3903,11/27/2021,1,What fund should the lump sum go to
hmacoi3,WolverineTherapy,11/27/2021,1,Thats why they sell homeowners insurance.  People need to live somewhere.  It makes more sense to own yours than to not.  Youre trying to convince yourself that you are more sophisticated than you are.
hmbmev7,Stoic_Chief,11/27/2021,1,Yeah it does. I was hoping to stay here for a couple of year. I expected rent to go up but not by this much. Luckily Ive found some places that look promising. Moving is just a headache though itd be nice if I could work something out with where Im staying now. Ill call on Monday.
hmbpkg8,throwaway1937725,11/27/2021,1,Trust me vehicles around $3k are typically money pits. Can I ask - do you have a long term plan? I‚Äôm sure doordash is fine right now but eventually you will want something higher paying and slightly more interesting.
hmbqdop,Schreindogg,11/27/2021,1,It may have a minimum use requirement which they could charge you for if its not met each month? Not always the case but I have seen it before. I wouldnt just go signing up for everything read the terms and conditions carefully. Those credit card companies are in it for the money never forget that.
hmbovc4,hurricanedan229,11/27/2021,1,Yeah kinda true
hmbf8p1,phrenic22,11/27/2021,1,How do you feel about taking a loan against your portfolio? If you transfer your stocks (ACATS transfer not sell and rebuy) to interactive brokers you can take out a margin loan for ~1.6%. keep in mind theres risks of getting margin called in a severe downturn. But you wouldnt have to sell anything in the interim.
hmbd5sv,GleamLaw,11/27/2021,1,What is the point of money if you can‚Äôt spend it on things that matter to you? What‚Äôs the point then? A friend taught this to me and I now balance money with life. And it‚Äôs a much better life.
hmbnafl,Fishy_Sezer,11/27/2021,1,Depends on your risk tolerance If youre worried about having to pay it back then come clean. That said if they intended to keep you at that pay then youre voluntarily giving it up.  If this were me Id pocket the difference. Id save it anyways so it would be there in case I needed to pay it back.  I might try to bring it up off-handed in conversation to see if any flags would be triggered. I definitely wouldnt ask them if Im being over-paid.
hmbgiaf,decanderus,11/27/2021,1,....can I have it for my bday next week?

hmbfpga,cactushugger8,11/27/2021,1,Makes sense!
hmbkyvj,CQME,11/27/2021,1,Ok...lets give this a shot.  Just FYI things may change depending upon where you are in the country.  Right now youre paying $1500/mo period.  Youre looking for a condo with a $1100/mo mortgage.    Add taxes and insurance lets say 1% property tax and $1000/yr insurance youre looking at around $3500/yr about $300/mo.    Add HMO lets say $200/mo.  Right now for this condo youre looking at $1600/mo and thats not including utilities or maintenance.  [This is a fairly good list](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/mortgages/expenses-of-home-ownership/) of what to expect outside of the mortgage.  They put in closing costs/escrow prepaids/mortgage points in there which is kind of silly since all that is part of the check you cut when you give the down payment but the rest of the list is pretty solid.

hmbg59p,Fish-Weekly,11/27/2021,1,That‚Äôs fine I‚Äôm just pointing out that you used a 10% return for your calculations. That‚Äôs fine for planning just saying in real life for the next 16 years it could be higher than 10% it could be lower than 10% or it could be exactly 10%. Not everyone gets that. The poster asked if these projections were accurate.  They are not - no one knows what the S&P 500 will return over the next 16 years but you‚Äôve got to start with something to go by so from that perspective save as much as possible and monitor your progress.  Nothing wrong at all with your answer I was just adding to the conversation.
hmao6f7,baddad49,11/27/2021,1,perhaps consider extending the term (maybe 15 year) so that youre not locked into that higher payment in case something happens along the way and you are not in position to continue paying the $4k/month...but of course while you are able to then def make the extra payments toward the principal

Were not doing posts about luxury products expensive cars etc. anymore because (a) they generally just provoke unproductive discussions and (b) most of the time it is very clear whether the person asking is able to afford the item.  1. If you are considering buying an expensive car the [vehicles wiki](/r/personalfinance/wiki/vehicles) has budgeting advice. We recommend reading it. If you dont meet 100% of the criteria then no you cannot afford it and you should not buy it.  2. In general if youre not on step 6 in [How to handle $](/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) you should find a less expensive alternative to a luxury product. If you are on step 6 then feel free to spend money on whatever is most important to you.  *If you have questions about this removal please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpersonalfinance&subject=Removal%20help%20request&message=Hello%20moderators%20<describe%20your%20issue%20here>.%20%0a%0a%0aMy%20submission:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/r3epmc/can_i_afford_this_vehicle/%0a).*

hmbo7pa,MakeItHomemade,11/27/2021,1,Yep.   My dad just sold his income property because the management kept raising rates and they were making more off of it than him.   It is an easy rental .25 miles from a major university older home but everything updated in 2006 at time of purchase. They have painted freshened up over the years.
hmbalr4,Snakebyte130,11/27/2021,1,See if it can be added to crp or something. Contact your local fishery and wildlife office and they can help you look into this.
hmbol7d,whatsmynamema,11/27/2021,1,No the when being the inevitable meaning I would wait until whenever it goes back up because it always does. I couldn‚Äôt put any kind of date on it just hope it‚Äôs within the next few weeks or I‚Äôll probably just sell regardless

hmbfksn,Wermys,11/27/2021,1,If they didnt cash it.  That means the check either was received and they lost it or they didnt receive it at all.  Claiming that it is already paid isnt going to fly here.  Bill pay really is just a check that is sent that is all.  It isnt PROOF that the payee received it.   Go to the bank ask them to pull the records see if it was cashed and then send proof or if not cash void the previous check and resend.    Not really much to it here.  Most people are reasonable as long as you can show proof of what happened.

hmbdj5h,primarycare2b,11/27/2021,1,The average non-travel nurse makes $68-$100k depending on the state they work in (3 12hr shifts/week) with 401k insurance full benefits etc.  As a travel nurse OP makes 3-4x the hourly wage of an employed nurse. It is OPs fault for cheaping out and not getting insurance.
hmbltin,dont_know_me_anymore,11/27/2021,1,The most important thing is teamwork. What do you each want your life to look like financially? What happens when you have kids? How do you want to prioritize saving for retirement and emergencies? Stuff like that. My husband and I admittedly didn‚Äôt discuss our finances enough before we got married or even early on in our marriage. As a result we did end up with more debt than we should‚Äôve and not as much retirement savings as we could‚Äôve if we‚Äôd just sat down and really talked things through better. It‚Äôs easy to not worry or talk much about money when the bills are always getting paid but you can get a false sense of security in that position. It took us probably 8 years of marriage before we really worked together to achieve common goals rather than just make sure the bills were paid.

hmbm27z,Stoic_Chief,11/27/2021,1,Yeah pretty much what I was thinking - was just hoping there was some other angle I wasnt aware of.   Ill call them on Monday and see if I can negotiate. Ive been looking for new places all day today and Ive found some apartments that are comparable to where I am now (some even better) and that are closer to the rent I use to pay. Moving is just a hassle lol but Im prepared to do so.   And yeah I know owning is the way to go. This is actually my first apartment (only been here a year) - my goal was to maybe rent for 2-3 years and would have hopefully saved enough for a down payment on a Condo/ Townhouse. This is why I really dont want to pay too much rent.
hmbkfdr,Cruian,11/27/2021,1,Different scoring models from different scoring model development companies. Also in some cases exact update date (of what gets shown to you) may play a role. Both can be completely accurate.

hmb8r3q,arisaulrich,11/27/2021,1,Yes exactly Id just be using the money in the account to reserve the space. I wouldnt invest it at all until I had my emergency fund saved up in full.  At what point would you say I bonds might be relevant for me?  Thanks for your input.
hmbotlo,RoastyMcGiblets,11/27/2021,1,Did you at least try to counter the new job? If you say Id love to work for you but I cannot afford to take a pay cut they might magically find some money for you. Especially if you dont think its your dream job or going to be something long term. Id say no dont take it if they cant at least match your job. You dont KNOW that your boss wants to get rid of you you are not in a really bad position here that is one possibility but they may be sincere about wanting to keep you happy.   The path of least resistance with a difficult boss or when youre in a bad position like this is unfortunately being a yes man or woman. Express your thanks for their offers and act enthusiastic about it. You might consider deleting your resume from public sites but in your spare time be applying to everything and anything you can find. 3 years is plenty of experience to catch another companys attention.   That said when interviewing keep the negative stuff to yourself and say lack of growth opportunities as the reason to look for a new job.
hmblgu5,not_falling_down,11/27/2021,1,Its better than a general table. When you make you own account it will show you what you specifically are projected to receive. The closer to retirement you are the more accurate the figures are likely to be.
hmadd3w,amysteriousperson001,11/27/2021,1,For Marcus and Amex I‚Äôd agree with that theory.  But some of those others like Evolve Bank and Chime are checking accounts.  Odd.
hmbivbf,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,Maybe it was a distribution from an inherited Traditional retirement account. If not Im with you OP may be mistaken about it being taxable.
hmbnu5w,burn-my-dread,11/27/2021,1,That is a possibility but it also possible that the other company wont work out. If they gave you the counter off you mentioned they want to keep you.

hmbnorr,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1,FICO claims their score is used in 90% of lending decisions. Im unaware of any lender that uses Vantagescore.  Another thing to keep in mind is you have 3 different credit reports and you could be seeing a FICO score based on Equifax for e.g. and a Vantagescore from Transunion. There could be a collections account on Transunion that is dropping your scores. Generally for someone with established credit history the scores tend to be pretty similar.
hmbo279,LittleGirlTeethMeme,11/27/2021,1,I would gently suggest living together and not getting married until age 25+. Lots of evidence that our brains are still maturing until around age 25 and marriage failure rate is significantly higher in those who marry before age 25 vs. those who marry at 25+. You‚Äôll also likely be more financially secure by that age or at least have an idea of some major life goals/career trajectory (might be done with any formal education etc.). Divorce can be VERY expensive. Avoid it if you can!
hmbmo9p,quelindolio,11/27/2021,1,Are you male or female? Rates typically go down sooner for young women than they do for young men. My husband‚Äôs car insurance rate didn‚Äôt drop until he was 25. Mine went down when I turned 21. However my stepmother lied to me for a year and said it was still over $200 a month. If you are 23 and female I‚Äôd definitely look into getting your own insurance. It shouldn‚Äôt be that high with a good driving record.
hmbn7px,tofurito,11/27/2021,1,Can you afford counseling? It sounds like you have some unresolved issues that could be assist by that. I was homeless from 19-23 years of age but am now making right under 6 figures in a somewhat low cost of living area. It has taken me years of therapy to unlearn the difference between catastrophic thinking and erring on the side of caution. I can relate to the clothes thing. What I would suggest is investing in good pieces of clothing that you know will last for years versus fast fashion when you want or need something new.
hmbgzzf,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,This is probably the option that would best fit what youre trying to accomplish.
hm9tmhp,sluox777,11/27/2021,1,What you are looking for is something called a Special Needs Trust. You need a trust and estate lawyer. Their services also typically include solutions for the other questions.
hma3a5w,taurusfeeling,11/27/2021,1,Good point re growth but there are lots of high quality companies that pay a dividend.  I guess I‚Äôm thinking more VIG than VYM or SCHD.  I like companies that consistently can grow the div over time vs a high payout scenario
hmbn5ty,Varathien,11/27/2021,1,Yes definitely sell the crypto to pay off debt.
hmbexk0,Rosie-Disposition,11/27/2021,1,What do you want out of life?  Is collecting money really your number one goal?  Do you want a spouse? Kids? To see the world? To serve others? What do you want to reflect on when you are on your death bed? These are the things to spend money and time on. You won‚Äôt think about that really cool apartment you rented but you will think about feeling safe and cozy at the holidays making lifelong memories with your loved ones. You won‚Äôt think of that expensive jacket but you will think about that awesome concert where you wore it.  Your confidence is suffering for a fixable problem like acne? Why aren‚Äôt you don‚Äôt anything about it? Dude sign up for an online dermatologist today and your topical medication will arrive in the mail next week. If that doesn‚Äôt work after 3 months you can go get accutane from a doctor in person.  Afterwards at your salary some laser treatments will take care of most of the scarring. Why do you think you have to suffer through this?  You can also see a therapist to get to the bottom of why you put yourself through unnecessary hardship punishing yourself and holding yourself back in life.
hmb6t2d,RedditShitCommenter,11/27/2021,1,How are you a nurse with no insurance?  How are you a nurse getting shafted by a system that needs your service?  Does the hospital know you are a nurse?  Can you get an itemized bill and some sort of healthcare worker discount?
hmblf8d,quelindolio,11/27/2021,1,This. My dad worked as a retail pharmacist for decades because it pays the most. He got so sick of it that he took a cut in pay to go to a mail order pharmacy. That place had its own issues but no more screaming customers was much better for him. He ultimately switched back to hospital pharmacy because it was much more interesting. There are many other pharm tech options. It‚Äôs an in-demand skill.
hmbg9fn,Liu1845,11/27/2021,1,You should have gotten an EOB (explanation of benefits) from your insurance showing the doctors office charges what the insurance paid and how much you owe yourself. If you didnt get this call your insurance. Many have websites you can check this on. Then take your EOB and proof of what you paid to the doctors office to show them. They should be able to get you a check within 30 days. Only give the doctors office copies keep your originals.
hmbqzrw,AGrainOfSalt435,11/27/2021,1,Is the annual income before or after taxes and retirement contributions? Just curious. Looking into possibly buying a house in the near future (next few years) but we do contribute quite a bit to retirement.

hmb7i5n,wtf-am-I-doing-69,11/27/2021,1,They have to find the other property in 45 days and conclude the sale in 180.   Since we are talking about hotels I would think this means find the other property first before selling (due to timelines for due diligence etc)
hmbm1s3,bobcats2002,11/27/2021,1,Sorry. What numbers should I focus on?  I have GAP so I understand the car is essentially covered. I dont know what Im paying the insurance for. The maximum for bodily injury is only $60000 on our plan so its not high enough for any severe injuries.   Its my first time really paying attention to it so Im open to any advice.
hmbnj29,RO489,11/27/2021,1,Rule of thumb is that housing (or mortgage) shouldnt be more than 3x your annual income.   Like all rules of thumb- its loose and highly dependent on other factors (car payments and student loans and cost of living are the big ones)
hmbla8q,Undercovergreen,11/27/2021,1,Age and time on the road are probably the biggest factors. When i was 18 i paid the entire cost of my car every year ($5000)
hmbfvor,whatsmynamema,11/27/2021,1,Very Smart of you
hmbkxmw,tenaciouslyteetering,11/27/2021,1,Similarly my standing advice is to wait until youve both lived independently (including with a roommate that isnt each other) before getting married.  You change when you first move out. And if you move straight from your family home to living with a partner its easy to slip into an unhealthy someone-is-the-child dynamic.   Before living on ones own its hard to actually know if they are clean if they can pay bills on time and more. Taking care of your room and finances without bills is not the same.
hmbf4oq,SolutionLeading,11/27/2021,1,Does your current leasing agreement require a 60-day notice? Check your leasing agreement and local laws too and see if the apartment notified you in a timely way about the rent increase. They may have broken the law by telling you so last minute?

hmbk9jn,bobcats2002,11/27/2021,1,What do you mean hard mode? Is it factoring in my credit score because its in the mid-700s.
hmbt3qy,imitation_crab_meat,11/27/2021,1,She also didnt get her license until 2 years ago which could be a factor. If you get your license at 16 youve got 5 years experience when you turn 21.
hmblgg3,bobcats2002,11/27/2021,1,$50.00 x 50 = $2500 over the life of the loan that could be saved. $50 isnt much but it adds up and could be used for anything else.   > $250 x 12 = $3000   The car is valued at $7000 as of November 2021. Assuming the insurance isnt again lowered next year Im paying almost 45% of the value of the car. There is no way I come out on top or financially recover from that.

hmbm7c0,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1,Keep credit utilization below 10% for the best possible scores.  Most banks only report your statement balance once a month so you would need to pay early to get a lower balance reported.  Also you should be asking for credit limit increase periodically. Goal for credit building should be to get limits high enough where your everyday spending represents no more than 5-9% of your credit limit. It sounds like your scores are fluctuating 20 points due to few open accounts and low credit limits.  Secured card is no different that unsecured card. You can get approved for plenty of unsecured cards with your credit history and theyll often pay you $200+ sign-up bonus.
hm97oxi,Greenappleflavor,11/27/2021,1,If your take home is $3400 and bills are about $2500 what happens to the difference of $900? Spent? Saved?

And my tax bracket now is pretty low compared to what it will be in a few years.  I will change to pre-tax contributions later once our salary increases to get those sweet tax savings.

hmbha90,GunSlinger420,11/27/2021,1,Possibly. I have also worked in local government and seen crazier things before. Lol.  In this case I think it was an EPA change that then trickled down to the State level. It is still a Wetland but the change allowed for further mitigation efforts and moving of the buffer zone.   This all being said Im sure the county looked at the land they had on the books and adopted the law only after they saw it would have a significant financial gain for them to do so.

Havent paid a dime in maintenance of any sort...yet.  To buy this house I had to finish renovations on one I was looking to sell...those renovations cost upwards of $30k to include tearing out the carpet and installing tile dealing with 2 leaking toilets both of which cause mold damage retiling one of the shower stalls a hole in the patio roof installing concrete in the driveway (dirt was entering the garage) cutting down the dead tree in the front yard and replanting another one irrigation system for the new tree and the least of all my concerns pulling out weeds which filled up a u-haul trailer.  Thats just what I remember.  I believe the article says to expect 1% of house price per year in maintenance so in your case around $2500/yr but if you had to replace a roof youre going to need probably $15k or so to replace it.  So youd probably want $15k on hand and then replenish whatever you spent that year on an annual basis which hopefully will be $2500 or less.

hmbqpec,Neighbor1973,11/27/2021,1,I recently did a refinance through Filo Mortgage and had a great experience.  Filo Mortgages rates were the lowest for my particular situation.  I think getting the lowest rate is the best approach as it will reduce your interest expense over the life of the loan.
hmbm4ze,lucky_ducker,11/27/2021,1,Yes. You will have to move the full $1086.61 to an IRA or a new 401(k) / 403(b) within 60 day or you will owe taxes and penalties.
hmbpg8a,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,This. We dont lower pay if we drop your job title.   I guess because dropping wages comes with too much HR legal risk.

hmbozsx,_DeadSeaSquirrel,11/27/2021,1,They cant ask for the money back because there is no money to return.   They can lower your pay going forward but you need to agree to it (or choose to be let go). They cant retroactively modify your pay without your consent otherwise wed have shit employers pulling that on people all the time..
hmah9i0,n0radrenaline,11/27/2021,1,Reading this and all your responses I honestly think you should take out student loans. This is essentially an extended emergency situation. You need to be able to focus on what matters: your kids your education. You need to be clear-headed and have resources to deal with whatever else your ex throws at you. Millions of people are dealing with student loan debt its not life-ending.  About the job you currently have: a lot of people are telling you to get a better one but they are likely underestimating the value of the childcare assistance your job gives you (and tbh the value of working for people who are sympathetic to childcare needs like yours). This may well be the best fit for your situation.  *However.* Theres one thing Im hearing that dont like. You seem to be excluding yourself from some of the better-paying jobs because you dont feel qualified and youre not enthusiastic about them.   One: these are entry-level jobs! You are qualified and that voice saying youre not? Thats your abusive exs voice. Plus job descriptions always list more requirements than whats actually required for the job youre supposed to apply anyway and help them figure out whether youve got enough of what they need.  Two: the dirty secret about exchanging ones labor for capital is that youre not gonna love it. If it was fun and meaningful and brought you joy they wouldnt have to pay you to do it. Nobodys out there just *wildly passionate* about insurance adjustment or desktop support or whatever. You look for a job that roughly fits your abilities (good with numbers? outgoing? detail-oriented? thorough? bilingual? etc) and when the interviewers ask why you want this job you just explain how it matches your aptitude/preferences. You dont have to be like ever since I was a tender youth I have dreamt of auditing sales reports for a mid-sized hose and gasket distributor everybody knows thats nobodys passion but they still need somebody to do the work.  Again not saying that you should switch your primary job but if you think it might benefit you at some point Id encourage you not to reject yourself on others behalf.

hma91nk,Calm_Tomato,11/27/2021,1,You‚Äôre 24. What matters most when planning for retirement is the amount of time that money you invest has to grow.

hmadg9l,MathAndCS_Nerd,11/27/2021,1,Also for budgeting - as long as youre not living beyond your means for now take a few months and see what you spend on what. There are many budgeting apps that can help or just put it all in a spreadsheet. Figure out where very dollar goes - dining out rent clothes etc. See what categories you spend on and how much you spend on each category. Assess for yourself what you might be able to adjust - rent is fixed (at least under your lease) but maybe you can buy fewer new clothes. Or if you dont spend a lot on clothes maybe you spend a lot on entertainment. Maybe youre fine with how much you spend on each category but you just want to know what to do with extra money aka savings/retirement.  Once you get a high level view of your spending habits that will help you see where you can make adjustments (if any) and how much wiggle room you have in your finances. Also be sure to assess for yourself what your priorities are - maybe you want to keep your current lifestyle and save less or maybe you want to save more aggressively and are willing to give up a few luxuries for your savings/retirement. Only you can answer those kinds of things for yourself.  While its great to want to jump in head first and get started sooner than later a little while of learning budgeting and your own habits can make a huge difference. Starting now but blind is not as likely to go as well as starting in a few months with more knowledge and understanding.

I worked for years in the field as an insurance adjuster and there were absolutely tow lots that were run as transparently and as professionally as any other business.  Of course there were some awful tow lots as well.   And there are probably a higher proportion of shady businesses in the tow industry.

hmbjpew,cosmos7,11/27/2021,1,I dont understand that at all... sounds like complete bullshit.  For a simple estate there is no need for an estate lawyer and thus no real fees to speak of.  Simple deed transfer doesnt cost $4k even if you have some other party do it for you.  If there is an estate lawyer involved for some reason neither OP nor the other parties involved are obligated to pay them.  Its dependent upon the locale but is generally limited to a percentage of the estate and should not be $4k for a property only worth $5k.  If they want money they have to collect from the estate anyway... I would just walk away at that point.

hmajtqt,tiny_questionz,11/27/2021,1,I did this after getting debt free.

hmbn8kb,artificialterf,11/27/2021,1,Believe or not they normally don‚Äôt cut your pay when you are demoted or take a ‚Äúlower‚Äù position.

hmbg6cb,Mayor__Defacto,11/27/2021,1,With scheduling you don‚Äôt really need it to be processed instantly. Plus it allows for transaction reversal where instant processing would leave people with less recourse.  RTPs do exist in parallel also processed by the ACH system. But it isn‚Äôt just banks - it‚Äôs also because of the way companies operate too. Most companies prefer batch processing because it allows them to review all the transactions for the day to approve the disbursements all at once. Additionally companies prefer to get paid as soon as possible but pay vendors as late as possible.

hmasl29,crabbingforapples,11/27/2021,1,I think it‚Äôs the former. Do some BiggerPockets searches and you‚Äôll see good feedback. The universal negative complaint is that they are the most expensive turnkey company in the region. They charge a premium for their longevity in the industry and reach. Whether that is worth the premium is an open question.
hmbnc1w,DestroyerOfIphone,11/27/2021,1,Sounds like youre in E heat or aux heat mode. Which uses coils like a space heater. This happened to me last year after a power outage my heat pump malfunctioned and my HVAC was stuck permanently in eheat.
hmaiq2p,RoastyMcGiblets,11/27/2021,1,Is it legal to sell baked goods created in your home in your area? Its common (in the US anyway) that you have to use an approved kitchen. In my area everything has to be stainless steel and there can be no children or pets who have access to it - thus many bakers rent space in commissary kitchens. So first off Id not quit my job if you are operating under the radar where your income could be shut off based on a complaint from a competitor.   Youd have to decide if the risk of being self employed justifies the reward. IME many entreprenuers fail to account for the time spent on marketing taxes and other housekeeping stuff. And they dont charge enough to be able to contribute to 401Ks (and you never get an employer match) or to be able to take time off. They end up half-assing everything until they are stressed out and frustrated and throw in the towel. If youre going to do it just make sure you have the mental and physical bandwidth to do it right.  I think Id stick with the day job until your debt is paid off and you have some breathing room financially.
hmaniwa,wild_b_cat,11/27/2021,1,The simplest way to build a portfolio is something called the 3-fund model:  [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund\_portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)  The idea is that you want to diversify into as much as possible.

hmaz895,jenny200,11/27/2021,1,Do you need your car for your job?
hm96sxo,vgacolor,11/27/2021,5,This is difficult to advice on because we are really looking at a decision that has several components. The first one has to do with your desire to change careers. The second one is the financial impact. There are others such as cost of the education ability to get a job in the new field expected progression in your new field etc.      So lets talk mostly finance impact. At first glance it does seem like an expensive proposition. Lets assume you will need 3 years total to get a bachelors in Computer Science. Even pairing down your expenses We are talking about $100000 with in-state tuition and you will be 46 and a newly graduated CS major competing with 23 year olds.    So quick question about this CS career you want to have? What is the salary you expect? What do you want to be doing? Have you researched salaries out of college and within five ten years of experience. Will your marketability be impacted as a 50 year old with four years of experience competing with 27 year olds with four years of experience for the same job.    I dont want to throw cold water on the whole thing just want to make sure that you look at the possible downsides. You can easily be 46 with half of your retirement savings gone in 3 years.
hmb7c0y,alto-sun,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for the kind and thoughtful response. I do stress a lot and am prone to anxiety and this affects my diet which may in turn affect my acne like you pointed out.

hmabsca,1hotjava,11/27/2021,1,For self employed people it‚Äôs more difficult to secure a mortgage since income is not as steady. I‚Äôd think that 8mo of business income isn‚Äôt enough to establish a track record and thus why the mortgage broker is wanting him to take SS benefits since that‚Äôs guaranteed. Previous job income is irrelevant since that‚Äôs not future income which the bank looks at  The broker BTW is trying to make it so that dad is more likely yo get approved but they don‚Äôt actually approve loans that‚Äôs the underwriters job and they have the final say. So that‚Äôs why the broker is wishy-washy on it.

hm9rv4t,Mojang57,11/27/2021,1,With collection agencies send a certified letter asking for proof of the original  debt. By law Debt collectors must send you a written ‚Äúvalidation notice‚Äù that states how much money you owe the name of the creditor and how to proceed if you want to dispute the debt. If they cannot provide this proof demand that they remove the debt from your credit reports. CC all three credit agencies.
hmbb04n,jone7007,11/27/2021,1,I can be this way.  Sitting down and planning out where it makes sense to spend more for the quality of life improvement works for. Otherwise I just feel like Im spending a lot with no control or that life sucks. Know how much I have to spend and why Im spending it helps a lot.
hma00rj,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,Im so sorry to hear about your accident. Thats exactly why I quit my second job a few weeks ago because there were occasional nights when I would feel drowsy driving home and I was afraid of accidentally killing someone.

hm9f8if,dj_benito,11/27/2021,-7,IMO its a perfect job for a young person looking to break into the workforce. You rely on him for the skills youre learning and the paycheck and he relies on your good work ethic and ever increasing abilities.   For now it keeps money in your pocket to cover the essentials. Its also a way to understand what the working world is like and learn some skills. Eventually you may earn a raise for reliability and good results or you can take what youve learned and use it to land a better position elsewhere.

hmb0300,Poctah,11/27/2021,1,Just call them up. They should issue a check right after you call or may have already. I had this happen when my daughter got a mole removed. They said it would cost $800 and made me pay before the procedure. Turns out since it was to check for cancer and prevention that my insurance pays 100% so I owed nothing. As soon as I got the eob I called and they sent me a check in the mail that day for the $800(took 3 days to get to me in mail but they may be able to do a chargeback depending on how you paid which could be faster). I was also told they would have found the error at the end of the month and issued a check anyways but if you call it should speed up the process.
hmba7kc,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,Could affect whether property ownership for rental can be considered part of the LLC was my thinking.  They are a common vehicle for real estate investments. The OP had the idea of investing in rental property as way to lower taxes. The structure of an LLC is determinant as to how it is taxed. So while not directly a defined tax entity  it will most definitely affect taxation.   Per the IRS Depending on elections made by the LLC and the number of members the IRS will treat an LLC as either a corporation partnership or as part of the LLC‚Äôs owner‚Äôs tax return (a ‚Äúdisregarded entity‚Äù). Specifically a domestic LLC with at least two members is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes unless it files Form 8832 and affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation. For income tax purposes an LLC with only one member is treated as an entity disregarded as separate from its owner unless it files Form 8832 and elects to be treated as a corporation. However for purposes of employment tax and certain excise taxes an LLC with only one member is still considered a separate entity.

hmb96on,awkwardsysadmin,11/27/2021,1,I have invested in some P2P loans before and even somewhat high risk borrowers will usually pay back their loans. Even those that default usually at least make several months of payments so even loans that are a loss arent a total loss. With a large enough portfolio of loans those that pay in full with interest make up for the losses although obviously the defaults drag down returns. Its not the same demographic as people taking out pay day loans or other similarly predatory loans but the riskier borrowers just pay even higher interest rates where it becomes relatively realistic for most defaults to still be profitable.

hmaxtah,zelephant10,11/27/2021,1,I would build an emergency fund to cover at least 3 months of expenses and/or any unexpected costs that would arise. After that I‚Äôd tackle your car loan early and maybe shop around for better insurance rate. 340 a month is very high unless your record is really bad.
hm92grk,DeluxeXL,11/27/2021,2,> why would it be illegal if I‚Äôm just getting my own money back??   It is not. Read it again.  Intentionally breaking up your deposits to **try to bypass the 10k reporting** is illegal and called structuring.  If you have 20k cash to deposit deposit 20k together.
hmb36pb,JhihnX,11/27/2021,1,I mean if you‚Äôre ever going to be in a position where you need those funds ASAP and can‚Äôt afford a turnaround time of 2-5 business days that would be a reason.

hmazgfz,blondie401,11/27/2021,1,I tend to use net to be more conservative however I think it‚Äôs important to keep in mind how much you‚Äôre ‚Äúlosing‚Äù from gross to net for non-tax items.   My husband and I contribute 10%+ to our (Roth) 401k accounts and will likely increase in 2022 if we lose the option to contribute to a Roth IRA. However if this pushes my mortgage to be a higher % of net (it will) I don‚Äôt worry about it hurting my liquidity because I could stop/lessen those contributions if needed.  Best of luck!
hmbchfd,cm253,11/27/2021,1,This needs to be higher.  Marriage is cheap cheaper than two people being single.  Divorce is expensive.  Its costs are not only financial but the financial costs are high.  Marry because you want to be married not for any perceived financial benefit.  Stay single because its the right choice for you not because you think marriage is too expensive.  My husband any I spent about $1000 on our marriage rings included.  Still together 12 years later.  We went from broke as a couple of jokes to early retirement.  Money was not and has never been the reason.
hmberx1,Joy8181,11/27/2021,1,I absolutely did choose that and I choose to give them a wonderful childhood in a nice place to live. Therefore I have made adjustments elsewhere in my finances. I‚Äôm not struggling at all. Certainly not extended beyond my means whatsoever. Never even said that. I‚Äôm set to retire early and I can‚Äôt wait.   My point is you‚Äôre insisting that one rule applies to all and no one will get ever get ahead unless they follow this - but it is not always possible to follow this ‚Äúrule.‚Äù Nor have I called you names my observations of your attitude as smug and obtuse and your unwillingness to understand other people‚Äôs experiences and how they navigate them well that is already low to begin with.

hmbh74b,ApatheticAbsurdist,11/27/2021,1,Buy the house after youre married. It will be a lot cleaner legally. If you want to do it before the wedding one person buys the other pays rent equal to half the mortgage once married it will become shared property.  Two areas to focus on with your extra money: 1) downpayment for the house and 2) retirement investments. 3) Debt   Roth is ok but youre getting up there in salary to the point where the benefits might not be as good as they were when you were making less. But it doesnt hurt to diversify. Either adding more money to your 401k or your Roth wouldnt be bad. But if youre buying a house prioritizing socking money away in a high yield savings account wouldnt be a bad option in the interim.  If all your debt is below 5% it probably makes sense to pay those down at minimum payments as your retirement and house investments will probably outpace that debt. If you have debt with 7% or higher interest pay those down faster.  The higher your downpayment the better your options are and the lower your monthly payments will be (because of reduced principle and interest/PMI). Waiting til closer to your wedding to purchase might be good. The housing market is also a bit crazy right now so if renting lets you save more you could end up with something better a little down the road.
hmae3gh,Wahoo2K8,11/27/2021,1,Moving the vehicle won‚Äôt impact the claim.  However do you have any independent evidence showing the other driver ran the red light?  Without that then the other insurer denying liability is a real possibility.
hmbp3rq,SloothSloth,11/27/2021,1,From an income perspective don‚Äôt just count your base pay as your total pay. What‚Äôs the difference when you bring into account any stock options given to you bonuses 401k matches health insurance coverage and costs etc. does the new job look more appealing and livable once you‚Äôre comparing that?
hma6b65,Dahkelor,11/27/2021,1,Highly approved mentality.  Anyway as for your question since real estate is almost always an investment of sorts I wouldnt consider a nicer house necessarily as lifestyle creep. Its all the other stuff.
hmavmxl,jorge1209,11/27/2021,1,You shouldnt buy a car with cash like that. The dealer should accept a cashiers check or certified check and if they wont its because they are going to sell you a lemon and dont want to have a lot of paper records of the transaction.

hmb4wzs,invenio78,11/27/2021,1,That typically doesnt work and whos to say that its not the spouse that will be sued.  I think overall if you are married you should expect some risk absorption of your spouse.  If not married you are essentially two strangers in the eyes of the law.
hmb6cdy,mlorusso4,11/27/2021,1,See how much you‚Äôd be paying in taxes for the land. If it‚Äôs not too much generally wetlands are pretty valuable for hunters (at least where I am. Never hunted in Wisconsin). Where I am a decent plot can fetch up to $800 for the year just for deer and waterfowl hunting. You can put out a Craigslist ad and offer to auction off the hunting rights.  If that doesn‚Äôt cover the taxes or you don‚Äôt want to deal with that for a bit of passive income I agree with everyone else in here. Donate it a land trust
hmbcpfk,LLR1960,11/27/2021,1,I disagree on not taking the GF into consideration.

hmbes65,Nagare,11/27/2021,1,Not how that works unfortunately once you accept the hard inquiry and get approved then the damage is done and the new account is created. Your score wont drop any worse from closing it right away but itll still do the damage from inquiry and new account.
hm931uj,Zookeeper1099,11/27/2021,2,HSA is very debatable. It depends on how bad the high deductible health plan is. For people who is perfectly healthy and without kids it makes most sense. But if you typically spend anywhere more than $1000-2000 a year or you have some chronic problem or you have little kids that might needs extra care etc. you may end up spending way more money on your medical bills than the tax saving from HSA.   Also having a high deductible health plan discourages people from seeing doctors which can lead to major delays on finding early stage of major problems.   Besides the plan difference it also depends on your actual income if your effective tax rate is relatively low (I used to pay only 11% plus FICA effectively when I made 92k) HSA doesn‚Äôt save much tax on this part.   That said The actual benefit of HSA is too dependent that Id put it after Roth IRA.
hmbkpsi,se66ie,11/27/2021,1,Do you live in the county? Would it be possible to stop paying taxes on it and eventually having the county take it away (as long as you don‚Äôt live in the county)?
hmbrp70,93195,11/27/2021,1,FICO.    But if someone asks you feel free to use whichever one best suits the message you want to convey as either answer is true.  Most people don‚Äôt even know there is more than one anyway (there‚Äôs actually at least 10 scores including different FICO models - I think they‚Äôre up to about FICO 10 now).
hm9nkzo,swampler22,11/27/2021,1,From my search so far it actually appears that employers are allowed to do this though.
hmbh123,blondie401,11/27/2021,1,For sure! The interest rates on those mortgages are really low so if I were you I wouldn‚Äôt pay down on them until I was at the point that I wanted to retire and not have any debt. Or if you were no longer able to make a profit on the investment home.   Whatever you choose you seem to have gotten yourself to a good place so congrats on that!
hmbj0sh,champac,11/27/2021,1,No I dont use any of them
hmbqaf0,mrisuckwithmoney,11/27/2021,1,No I don‚Äôt. I was actually doing really well during 2020 I had 10k in stocks and 5k in savings with 0 debt. Then I started drinking smoking and just overall dumb decisions. Now I blew threw everything and am stuck in debt. All in under a year. My biggest goal right now is to pay of the debt and then maybe by and RV to live in.
hmb74xn,SSlipknot,11/27/2021,1,It sucks but maybe stick with wherever your at right now and save up as much money as you can and maybe even look for a better paying job if possible. Maybe come to a agreement about long term living with them and offer to pay some sort of rent or help pay groceries. I was in a similar situation and had to do that for awhile and it helped me out big time. I wish all the best for you and hope you have some good luck come your way!
hmb6iee,mikezampz,11/27/2021,1,Being frugal is good but if it comes to a point where it stops you from enjoying life then you have to ask yourself these questions: Why are you working and saving money for in the first place? So you can enjoy life later on? But why can‚Äôt you let yourself enjoy your life now by spending a little? Can you truly say you lived a life if it was miserable because you were so strict on your spending that it caused you to be miserable? How can you guarantee that you‚Äôll be alive at the age you plan to retire? You have to think about these things. Enjoy your life now and your future self by treating yourself from time to time and still saving some money. You don‚Äôt have to spend massively to enjoy your life now. Just enough. My husband used to be frugal and not spend on himself. I asked him the same questions and was able to encourage him to start enjoying his life now because you never know how life‚Äôs gonna be later on. He was thankful after some time. XD
hmaabzz,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,Thank you! This helps so much. My husband and I have a great marriage and cant see ourselves divorcing but he is the child of divorced parents (and Im the child of parents who should have gotten divorced) and we wanted to be realistic. Friends of ours are also going through a somewhat messy divorce currently so we just happen to be seeing what a bad one can look like. Its not on the table nor do I think it ever will be but the idea that I may not have rights to certain assets in a divorce (even though Ill be paying toward the mortgage with him each month from our joint account) was nerve wracking. Thanks for the info!
hmauy1y,lcburgundy,11/27/2021,1,Are you under contract? What does your lender or loan broker say? You need to communicate with them and follow their directions. Making a major move during the purchase and underwriting process with assets you disclosed as being the source of your downpayment may cause your lender to bail and financing to fall through if you are doing it without their permission.
hmbj7qt,Unable-Paper-1996,11/27/2021,1,Also for consideration regardless of how the match is set up the match is based on the salary you actually receive during the plan year (and then resets when the new year starts).  So even if you accepted a job where you make a $100k annual salary if you start on October 1 you actually only actually received $25k for this plan year (estimated for ease of math).  So starting next year you will be eligible for up to $4000 in match but for the plan year when you first started  you would only be eligible for $1000 (4% of $25k).   Hopefully that helps you out :)
hmbhcaj,LooksAtClouds,11/27/2021,1,Why would it cost that much to do that? If OP buys the land from the estate wouldnt it be a rather simple transaction?
hmbgkb6,wanttostayhidden,11/27/2021,1,$19500 is the limit for the employees pretax and Roth contributions combined. There is another limit of $58000. The 58k limit includes the employee and employer contributions.
hmayje3,Varathien,11/27/2021,1,Marriage doesnt have to cost anything. Well a few dollars in court paperwork.   Weddings can range from the affordable to the ludicrously expensive.   Divorce is incredibly expensive. It sounds like youre already doing a good job at talking about things like combining your finances. But if theres any issue that you think might result in a big fight in 5 years... probably best to talk about it now.
hma03yj,Inevitable_Welcome23,11/27/2021,1,Do not pull from your retirement account for a house.  You are robbing your future self of the cost of that entire house in compound interest gain that would be tax free gain inside your roth 401k over the next 20-30 years. Just sell the stocks for the down payment as you can always buy more stocks in the future. You cannot add money back in to your roth 401k after it is withdrawn.   The loan looks nice but it isn‚Äôt. It creates a monthly payment that is disguised as cutting your tax free retirement contributions/gains over 5 years. Don‚Äôt do it. But you pay the interest to yourself right?? Yes but the 2-4% interest you pay yourself is not the 7-10% you would be getting in the market. Combine that with reduced overall roth 401k contributions and the risk of a huge tax bill if you lose your job or take a higher paying new job and your 35k down payment turns into a 150k+ net worth hit.   I would never be willing to take on a loan that locks me in to a set company for the next 5 years for a 5-8% interest rate and a ~30% tax penalty on the remaining unpaid balance to drop the loan or to avoid the penalty an instant payoff of the remaining balance if I accept a higher paying job at a different company or get laid off. It‚Äôs too much extra strings and stress when I could just sell stocks and not have a loan.
hmaycer,Alicia-XTC,11/27/2021,1,Whatever value folks want to use.  I get a fixed deposit 26 times a year.  That is money that I know I can use.  What happened to all the cash before Uncle Sam retirement and benefits doesnt mater.  I get X and I track the spending of each X to the penny.  I know exactly where it goes and what its for.  Since I have been doing that for awhile I know what I can and cannot afford.  To answer your question its whatever you want it to be.  At the end of the day you have X to spend on Y period.
hma2sb1,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,Thank you. Yes I am thinking about babysitting but that can be a childcare issue for me (Not many people like for the sitter to bring their own kids.). I live in a rundown apartment and I know people would not want to bring their kids to my home. Ive been following a babysitters group for years and most of the time when I see people request a sitter I see dozens of people respond trying to get the job. But I may try it soon. I am extremely well-qualified to babysit so maybe people would be interested in me.

hmakix6,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,If you are current and have no credit report damage then you want to pay it off.  A settlement is a ding on your report even a current settlement    So you are creating a ding where one did not exist prior and a ding that can be avoided by paying in full.  Im not saying you must pay in full immediately using your cash... But you want to aggressively pay down that high interest debt asap
hm9mgt9,Signal_Icy,11/27/2021,1,Well I can‚Äôt borrow because there‚Äôs no local library here but I‚Äôll try to see if I can borrow online. One book (the richest man in Babylon is very cheap and I have enough funds to buy it and order it rn but I‚Äôll check the online library thanks for that tip. I can‚Äôt actually switch Korean books because it will just make it more complex for me. The course of books I chose is very easy for me to understand and it would be a bother if I changed books now. They also offer exercises and they have a YouTube channel if I ever need help with the books. And they sell the exclusively in Korea but through Shopee I can get them with a discount. The books also contains links to audio resources so that‚Äôs that.

hmadqob,Inevitable_Welcome23,11/27/2021,1,Do not buy a house with a girlfriend. She can come with you to see the houses but everything else should be in your name only. Her income is not factored into the size house you can buy. She doesn‚Äôt go to the bank with you she doesn‚Äôt get to have a final say in which house you buy and she definitely doesn‚Äôt get to move in rent free (or move in while paying something) without signing a written & notarized lease agreement of some kind (month to month with a 30 day move out clause would be best if things go south and is legally your fastest eviction option).   If you don‚Äôt do this then she will be an ‚Äúat-will‚Äù tenant even if she doesn‚Äôt pay any real bills as even buying food or toilet paper counts as at-will rent and infers a 90 day move out notice with a follow up court ordered eviction (moratorium is still in place in some states so 90+ whenever the moratorium ends) which takes at least 2-4 weeks to implement in most cases. She could squat on you for 4-6 months with the dude she hypothetically cheats on you with unless you protect yourself.   This stance only changes if you legally marry her (not just get engaged or whatever). If you do that then you can buy a house together.
hma8k13,lost_in_life_34,11/27/2021,1,Try to pay off as much credit cards as you can by March and it will raise your score. If it‚Äôs only your husband on the loan then it‚Äôs only his income will be used for the ratios  If you pay down revolving debt then you should have a 680 or so middle by next year.
hma8d8t,TK_TK_,11/27/2021,1,What about maintenance? 1-3% of the home value per year. Closer to 3% than 1% for homes of that price & when you‚Äôre new to building up a maintenance fund. Even just 1.5% for a $280k house is $4200/year or $350/month. Are you accounting for that?  Maintenance is unavoidable even if you buy a brand new house even if the inspection is perfect etc. If you can‚Äôt save for maintenance you can‚Äôt afford a house.

hm8vf4e,BankEmoji,11/27/2021,1128,Criminal investigator here‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs not fire them immediately. You want to put them under a microscope and watch everything they do for a while.   If one person is doing it there are probably others.
hma2c7b,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,1,Dividends are effectively a forced sale of assets and companies paying dividends are signaling they have nothing better to do with your money than give it back to you.    It‚Äôs fine as part of a total market index fund but overweighting dividends (especially when young) isn‚Äôt the best strategy since you‚Äôre giving up on growth when you ostensibly have a very long time horizon.
hmaj2sw,BohoPhoenix,11/27/2021,1,Like others said high will be dependent on your budget/income but for comparison - we spend \~$550/mo between groceries/household items/eating out for two adults in a MCOL city that never host others. It can be higher if were buying alcohol more frequently.
hmalf9a,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,Houses are not a sure thing either. Thats an illusion.   Has real estate--specifically single family homes--performed somewhat predictably over the past 100 years? Yes.   Has the stock market performed somewhat predictably over the past 100 years? Yes.   Can you find a period of 5 10 20 30 years where SFH has been a better investment than the broad stock market? Starts with yes (ie yes but not common) but ends up no. Furthermore the probability weighs heavily towards investing winning out even over shorter periods.   Owning a home has other liabilities other than the buying/selling price: 1. Very illiquid. Doesnt matter how much its worth if its expensive/difficult to take advantage of. 2. Literal liability. Someone falls in your house/yard? Get sued. 3. Financial liability. Mold roofs termites ice dams sewage systems fire etc. 4. Opportunity cost. Having a house means keeping a larger e-fund money that will garner ~0% this on top of above discussion.  TLDR: houses are NOT a sure thing.
hm9r3vc,robertoblake2,11/27/2021,1,Had a plumber take a look and pipes are good. He said his only recommendation is a $2000 filtration system because there is a bit of chlorine not any dangerous amount but he would recommend it. So I‚Äôm doing that before the end of the year.
hmb74a3,kbecaobr,11/27/2021,1,80 year olds are not dementes invalids like you seem to think. Having health issue does not mean your life sucks. People still enjoy the outdoors family time go out with their SO make new friends at church or whatever hobby you have. Im a physician and I have seen hundreds of elderly patients in my job and I assure you MANY elderly (80+) live very fulfilling lives with family and friends around them. My wifes grandparents are perfect examples of that but I wont make my point on anecdotes. Maybe you should read more about life after 80 instead of assuming based on your family circumstances and personal bias.
hmapddw,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,So what happens in that rare case? Customer have to return the car?
hm9pcyj,crowd79,11/27/2021,1,I do this all the time and have made a few grand the past few years just opening and closing bank accounts taking advantage of bonuses.  Only limiting factor is your Checksystems inquiries will skyrocket and you‚Äôll get denied at some places.
hm90mso,Syric13,11/27/2021,30,I understand the hesitancy in having someone losing their job but sometimes they dont deserve that job in the first place.  We hold certain people in our lives to a higher standard. This is someone who has access to a lot of your information personal and private and he is using that to ask for money. This is I dunno like a nurse who knows you got prescribed painkillers asking if she can have some because shes in pain.   What he did was a complete and utter breach of protocol trust and I might think even a little bit illegal. This isnt a small complaint. This is a major violation. I assume you have no personal or even business relationship with the teller right? He just happened to be the teller available at the time. I would look into moving your assets filing a complaint and blocking him on social media with a warning that if he ever contacts you again you will be going to the police.   This isnt a minor violation or something where he had good intentions. Hell when I worked at Blockbuster I had a coworker get in trouble because he was looking up movies a customer rented out just so he can strike up a conversation with her. And that is minor compared to knowing financial information knowing your name/address and asking you for money.
hmaavfo,shea_harrumph,11/27/2021,1,no. youre raiding the 401k to get from 16% to 20% down. an 84% LTV loan will have a correspondingly low PMI and youll be very close to the 78% required for it to drop off.
hm9yvi3,Smurfilina,11/27/2021,1,Not totally sure what Im talking about but something about a W8-BEN Form  when filled in so tax isnt deducted in the US . . . . .
hmba4s2,rwhal06,11/27/2021,1,Yes personal use. I think your answer is probably spot-on. Thanks.
hmalhe2,weluckyfew,11/27/2021,1,Youre pretty confident for someone who has no idea what theyre talking about.  Read the other responses in this thread.
hm8zm8t,Consensual-Sex,11/27/2021,1,Also remember that once you got 750 any score higher than that isn‚Äôt treated any differently. Don‚Äôt spend extra money just to chase that 850 when it makes more financial sense to pay off a loan sooner.   A 750 isn‚Äôt that hard to get. I moved to the US and opened my first credit account November 2020. Took 3 months after that to even get a credit score. I now have a score of ~740. The only thing holding me back for the most part is that all my credit accounts are less than 2 years old.
hm9wdxj,ghostrecon11,11/27/2021,1,I don‚Äôt think the new firm could match given the size of the increase
hm9wvfz,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,1,I left about 45k on the table last year to leave my old job. No matter the amount really think of how your emotions will be if you walk away from that money. Ive thought back on it numerous times. However that environment at my old job had gone so toxic and I knew the wheels were falling off so to speak. I remained confident that my new job would be better for my career long term.  In this written agreement you‚Äôve been given is it long term? You could stay and feel out the new roles/responsibilities and give yourself time with the added financial boost.
hmac3ya,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,You can just take whatever your PRE-tax income is and subtract the total 401k/457 and enter that into the calculators.  Use $0 for 401k/457.
hmaw86w,ReddSaidFredd,11/27/2021,1,If you are consistently making $20/hour and your expenses are only $500 work 60 hours/week and pay the debt off in the next 4-6 months.   You need a written budget. Write down everything our are spending money on. You are overspending somewhere if you have $0 in the bank.
hm9x5nu,aaaaij,11/27/2021,1,Which is only really a concern if you plan to make a big purchase soon. The decrease to your credit score is temporary.
hm9l5jz,peacefulhectarez,11/27/2021,1,>because papa Sam taxes bonuses at 45%  Why does this myth refuse to die?  Bonuses are taxed just like any other wage or salary income. Withholding is higher on bonuses for most workers but the actual tax rate paid is the same.
hm9mn7l,chzsteak-in-paradise,11/27/2021,13, You have 60 days to put it in a new tax deferred account from the time you receive the check or you will owe the tax penalty.  You can roll it over into your new employer‚Äôs 401K if they allow you (usually it‚Äôs a form you have to fill out and send in with the check - ask your HR) or put it in an IRA which you can setup with any of the major financial institutions (Fidelity Vanguard T Rowe). Your local store for any of those should be able to talk you through it if you don‚Äôt know how. But remember the 60 days is a hard deadline!
hmb7e5h,ronnevee,11/27/2021,1,What is the travel that needs to be done and why is renting a car necessary for the trip? Is there no public transit or Uber? Or is the driving integral to the wedding activities?
hm9jo02,TOPDAWG21,11/27/2021,1,yeah remember a student loan is not free money.  Its not money to be spent to have fun or do things you cant really afford.
hmajav2,KatzMwwow,11/27/2021,1,No complaints. Good customer service via Twitter chat and phone. A certain number of non-PNC ATM fees can be reimbursed to me monthly. Its easy to manage your account online.
hm91joq,4_doors_more_whores,11/27/2021,8,Last I checked you can access facebook from a computer.  Do you not think people use printers anymore or something?
hm9xvbj,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,1,Capital One Venture Card. 2 miles for every dollar spent. The app is super easy to use and maintain. Also booking trips flights and hotels is easy within the app. Customer service with them has been fantastic as well. I have heard good things about some Amex cards but i‚Äôm very happy with my  Venture card. Plus its a metal card which i just like because it has more weight to it.
hm9yol1,orcateeth,11/27/2021,1,I thought of this also but was hesitant to suggest it as it is radical and could be offensive to some people who highly value their marriage. However its only sensible to consider all options where money is concerned.   People sometimes do this to qualify for Medicaid for nursing home care.
hm9ri5z,KReddit934,11/27/2021,1,Where are you that has no library?
hm8wfk8,charleswj,11/27/2021,6,I dont know if this has been mentioned and Im not sure even what your rights are/what their policy would be but Id request and push hard for access to an audit of what account and personal information this person accessed. This would be good to know in the case of future issues with credit or identity fraud. Depending on what information he has future account takeover fraud could be more likely.
hm9wof6,lolzveryfunny,11/27/2021,1,Well you don‚Äôt necessarily need a full match.  If they meet halfway it goes a long way to seeing how bad they want you.  Maybe it gives you information to help your decision.  Like if the manager or HR goes apeshit you get a red flag.

hma5sx9,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,In my old broad lived through a lot seen even more opinion...  Define what nicer houses means to you. Neighborhoods? Value? Nifty kitchen gadgets? Fabulous bathrooms? A yard?   Then interrogate exactly WHY you want it why youre willing to spend for it etc.   Then ask yourself this really harsh question. If the GF wasnt in the picture  what would you choose? Then ask why its different.  Now a more broad question. What do you mean good use of a raise? Perhaps start by defining what you believe is a bad use of the raise.   If this house is just a financial stepping stone on your way to a defined goal it might be better to make decisions based on risk and math. But if this house is meant to be your home -- your sanctuary and respite from the world a place to live laugh and grow as a human being -- well then plan and buy accordingly while factoring in risks and stresses from owning it that may have the potential to steal from your peace and joy.   Money isnt the only variable in these decisions.   Me? We live in an average home in an average neighborhood. No mortgage fully paid for. Weve customized some things over the decades that make our daily lives better -- without regard to what increases resale value or what is considered normal.  It works for us. We remain happy and contented here. There is no one true way when it comes to buying a house you want to be your home. My best advice is always begin major decision making by leaning hard into why you want a thing. It helps define the landscape of the decisions to he made.   Congratulations on your raise. Sounds like you have a history of making good decisions. üëç
hmatt46,atlfpaddict,11/27/2021,1,How long will it take you to save 90k? Do you have any debt? I personally wouldn‚Äôt recommend a house of that price on your salary. Maybe if you did have 90k down. But there‚Äôs a lot to consider in this situation.

hm94l46,SnooCauliflowers3903,11/27/2021,1,Whats the difference between the two
hma8yx9,keller892,11/27/2021,1,Another old person here. Factor in time as well. The nicer house will still be there in 2 3 5 years time. You can afford to buy it now but that doesnt mean you /have/ to.   It might be worth starting with the cheaper home to get some real lived experience of home ownership (trust me a house is wonderful but its also a money pit) and then upgrade later as your taste and finances permit.
hmape3r,soylentqueen,11/27/2021,1,>	do get a low interest credit card and build some credit  If youre paying off your card in full each month (as you should) the interest rate shouldnt matter!

hm8ybad,ghostManaCat,11/27/2021,1,Why don‚Äôt you believe in TSP? It‚Äôs definitely limited with regard to the number of options you can invest in but every fund available there is what you need to to have a simple and balanced portfolio.   TSP 401K Roth and Traditional IRAs are all essentially the same thing‚Ä¶ tax advantaged retirement accounts where you can invest in stocks and bonds. They differ generally by when you get taxed who provides/ sponsors it how much you can contribute to each account per year and what options are available to invest in.
hmakvxl,underbite420,11/27/2021,1,There aren‚Äôt any buildings on it. Put up no trespassing signs and you‚Äôre good
hmasf3v,HolyGig,11/27/2021,1,Sure but define early. Most people dont make enough to swing a 40s retirement unless they are extremely frugal so you are going to be less able bodied to do some of the things you might have wanted to do with all that time
hmb4sjv,ChipsAndLime,11/27/2021,1,Sorry to hear that you‚Äôre struggling. Maybe not financially but you are struggling.  I don‚Äôt think that you‚Äôre completely unreasonable in some of this.  Like not wanting to blow all of your money on housing for example.  You definitely should be safe especially if you can afford it. But living below your means within reason is valuable too.  Also acne _might_ be more a product of what you‚Äôre eating plus whether you wash your face at least once a day and whether you keep your towels clean. Fancy skincare might be far less relevant than you think.  You might consider looking for a therapist to help you with some of this.  I suspect that maybe you don‚Äôt think so highly of yourself.   Maybe that‚Äôs partly because of how you‚Äôve been treated in the past.  Either way that might make it seem fairly pointless to spend money on keeping your clothes looking good and other ways that you could take better care of yourself.  Listen you‚Äôre capable of being amazing and wanted by others.  Maybe you just need to get some help to see how that‚Äôs possible and what you can do to get yourself there.  I‚Äôll bet that you‚Äôre closer than you think. You might just need a little help.

hmbfgmr,vynm2,11/27/2021,1,>The structure of an LLC is determinant as to how it is taxed.   Yes the structure determines the taxation-- not the LLC.  OP will still be a sole proprietorship regardless of whether or not theyre an LLC.  >So while not directly a defined tax entity it will most definitely affect taxation.  Not really. A sole proprietorship is going to be taxed the same regardless of whether or not its an LLC.  From your IRS quote: For income tax purposes an LLC with only one member is treated as an entity disregarded as separate from its owner-- i.e. its treated as a sole-proprietorship. Its treatment only changes if it elects to be treated as a Corp. Its not the LLC that causes the tax treatment to change.
hm9y9bh,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,1,The change in responsibilities and huge jump in pay is very enticing. Its growth on two different fronts and doors will always open in the future. Plus your network will expand. Now im curious how this plays out for you haha

hm9tov0,JhihnX,11/27/2021,1,If it doesn‚Äôt pose a burden on you I would offer to keep him on for the time being if he so chooses with the understanding that he will pay his $50 share monthly as well as any costs he incurs (upgrades etc.). He would have to work with you when planning upgrades but I would imagine he would rather stay with your plan and reduce the burden of cost and of starting something new.  Of course if he isn‚Äôt responsible in making on time payments or racks up extra charges it would be better to advise him that he has X long to get a new plan started.  As far as credit goes he‚Äôs probably better off getting a credit card and starting there.
hmafzsk,Phillip_Jae_Fry,11/27/2021,1,Theyre okay just a normal regional bank. Their products are nothing special and their website is middling at best. Not as bad as some credit unions could be but not usually as easy to use as some of the major banks.  Neither Chase nor PNC offers much of a great product in terms of their checking account. If account minimums (to avoid monthly fees) is important to you Chase does require a $1500 minimum while PNC only requires $500. That said both banks allow you to avoid monthly fees if you have at least $500 a month in direct deposit.  Id say that if you have a branch thats more conveniently located vs Chase go for it. Otherwise its not really worth the hassle.
hm92m87,BeatMastaD,11/27/2021,1,Your company is offering you money and you arent taking it. Yes sometimes you may want to save for something else first its always good to have an emergency fund but not contributing up to their match if you can is a waste.

hmataam,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,The difference is not the dividends.  The difference is going to be in the rebalancing and the actual investments themselves.  If the investments are exactly the same as the underlying TDF holdings then it is going to be the rebalancing that makes the bigger difference.
hmb4ml9,LaughingIshikawa,11/27/2021,1,I would say net income.  If youre only thinking about taxes versus the various costs associated with having many jobs (such as needing to maintain a car) then it actually doesnt matter all that much anyway.  But net makes more sense to me because unless youre making enough to make tax ~~dodging~~ strategy important your taxes are just baked in to the process of earning that amount of income.

hmb89kw,Ojntoast,11/27/2021,1,Hi-Lo based processing always processed the credits first followed by debits in descending order.    But once you tell the bank that you want a time-based system then they decision items based on the time the item comes in so if you dont have money when you charge something you get charged a fee.
hmbc5ny,ZWilde17,11/27/2021,1,You dont have to spend that much on skincare. Curology is a good place to start. They have certified dermatologists thatll help with your skin problems with relatively decent pricing. (It ranges from 25-60) Ive tried it and Ive had good results. Customer service is great. I got a refund and a free bottle when one of the bottles they sent was expired.  Confidence is very important to have and will have an impact in all aspects of your life. From life quality to relationships to jobs. Id suggest you buy new clothes and skincare products. Theres nothing wrong with spending a bit on things that will help improve your self-esteem. Dress good eat good hit the gym and work on your mental health. Whether its with a therapist or just exploring new things about yourself.  Its easier said than done but try to remove or reduce things that stress you out or do things that relieve those stresses. Dont create such a strict budget or youll be constantly thinking about executing it to to T. Put some money aside and spend it on yourself.
hmb64nf,queeniev14,11/27/2021,1,PNC is fine.  Everyone Ive dealt with over the phone and at my branch has been generally pleasant and competent I get reimbursed for non-PNC ATM fees and the only time I got an overdraft charge it was due to bad mental math on my part but I still got it reversed by going to the branch in person and giving them a sob story.
hm8wrov,Ojntoast,11/27/2021,6,Having work for a bank for the last 13 years when I started we processed in a high low manner.  Which 100% is a leftover means of paying items from the days when checks were the primary method of payment.  Back then youd always want the bank to bounce your smaller checks and pay your larger checks just by default.   So when we changed to a time-based system it was interesting that we still were getting accused of specifically running debits to purposely charge people more fees because with a time-based system credits Post in time order not first like they do in a high low system.  Customers will always think that the bank is specifically doing things just to charge more fees when the reality is they have a posting process and if you abide by it youll never have a fee charged if you dont youll get a fee charged.  And it impacts different people differently because of their own habits.

hm8w937,eswolfe0623,11/27/2021,116,A few years ago bank tellers were making minimum wage while also  being expected to sell/upsell products. Im out of the business now and have done all my banking online since 2019.   Tellers are generally poorly trained and underpaid. And they deal with rude impatient people all day. Management has lost sight of the fact that tellers telephone support and the online banking systems ARE  the bank to most people.

hma0bp5,boredprogrammerguy,11/27/2021,1,I don‚Äôt really see an issue here unless you are sacrificing in other areas of your life that would bring you happiness to save this extra money.  All extra money does is give you options. Options to switch careers options to go part time. Or even to fully retire if you so choose. Figure out what brings you joy spend aggressively on that and ruthlessly cut everything else. If investing and early retirement gives you joy go for it. If you feel like eating out every day is what makes you happiest cut back your savings and enjoy your life now. Nobody can really give an answer to your question.  You may not realize it but you are in an amazing spot and have loads of options moving forward because of your income. Saving 25% of your income means you can retire in 32 years on the same income you currently have. Bump that up to 30% and now it‚Äôs only 28 years. 50% 17 years. https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/

hm9ezum,CedarBuffalo,11/27/2021,1,What is the cost of living like where you live? What is the minimum wage where you live?  Are you trying to support anyone other than yourself? Are you dependent on your parents?
hm8vx66,assertivelyconfused,11/27/2021,1,The 3% match is free money.    However 3% of $52k isn‚Äôt exactly earth shattering.  The 1% you miss with your fathers strategy is only $520/yr.  You have very little emergency savings.    Your $15k debt isn‚Äôt the end of the world but the interest rate is very important on how you choose to proceed.    Finally I think this comes down to your living expenses.  If you‚Äôre saving $20k/yr that‚Äôs much different than if you‚Äôre living paycheck to paycheck  Tldr - no one except maybe your father has enough information to say this is right/wrong.  Interest rate on loans and your living expenses are important variables.  Also 50% match on 2% of 401k contributions is only $540 of free money you miss out on per year.  Depending on your situation (barely breaking even or early career and have potential promotions in excess of $540 in the near term) this may or may not be splitting hairs.
hm95ara,lastduckalive,11/27/2021,1,Exactly. Coming from money is an emergency fund. Just both people who come from money and those who don‚Äôt want to admit that.
hm9o1pk,Little_Vermicelli125,11/27/2021,2,Federal government pension is very high and inflation protected.  In other words it will probably be close to $5000 a month next year.  Im honestly not sure there is much reason to invest as long as his wife continues getting his pension in the event he dies first.  Since its enough money to live well on.  Id maybe suggest betterment or wealth front or sigfig.  Go with a conservative account.  Or just get him some target date 2020 funds (or whenever he retired) through vanguard.
hm8ud2o,ejohnson33,11/27/2021,1,Third on this. Getting a big regular diamond is laughably priced.
hmab3i4,ahas-dubar,11/27/2021,1,this really depends on the amount of money youre talking about.  if its a few hundred bucks a year just open some side accounts in your names and name each as the beneficiary. let it grow and gift it to them when you want them to have it. you can even gift the funds in kind so the tax consequences will be their responsibility not yours.  if youre maxing the annual exclusion amount ($15k from you $15k from your spouse per year per child - so $60k per year in gifts) then its time to talk about setting up trusts.

hm90nyf,applepiecorgi,11/27/2021,2,Depends. Some will deny if the person isn‚Äôt on the policy. I see that more often with substandard carriers/ policies. Some policies have language stating there‚Äôs no coverage for unlisted household members who have regular access to the vehicle. With insurance you really should just read the policy to know what‚Äôs covered and excluded because the worst time to find out something isn‚Äôt covered is after an accident/ some other event that you thought was covered.
hmauipl,youngsimba320,11/27/2021,1,Ok thank you
hma1wiy,FunArt7,11/27/2021,1,Gotta say weird reading your story since I was in the exact same boat about a year ago with the same numbers almost to the dollar. Freaky honestly. Now i can say I did build savings for emergency then paid down student loans granted while they were frozen at 0% interest. And then have been pouring extra cash thats now free into my 401k. But since student loans are about to unfreeze I would split current priorities between building savings and paying off loans.

hm9lzhx,thentangler,11/27/2021,1,True.. but I don‚Äôt like anything where the bank expects a cash flow from you.  I can understand that they require a min deposit $25k $50k etc to make it worth their while but it defeats the purpose of a bank if they expect you to pay them every month just to keep their money‚Ä¶. Things can go south really fast if you can‚Äôt make that payment.
hmacdgu,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,Ive tried to figure out our taxable income but theres too many variables. I know that our gross income is $100k (41k for me 59k for husband) so the standard deduction of 25k would put us at 75k regardless of what is taken out in 401(k) taxes etc.

hmbd5k5,GunSlinger420,11/27/2021,1,I have 2 questions here.  1) If your grandmother owned the land why would it cost $4000-5000 to change the ownership?  2) Is the land adjacent or near any current or future developments?  I am a builder and Wetland mitigation laws and techniques are changing all the time. A worthless property now may be worth something down the road if near a desirable area.   Example similar situation. My grandmother owned a piece of land in New Jersey. 2 acres of wetland. While she owned it it was worthless but near a tourist beach community. When she passed we did bot want it and reverted it back to the county assessor for auction. Years later they changed the Werland mitigation laws and the land is now able to be developed on 1 of the two acres. What was once worthless I now worth between $150k-250K. Had we just held it we would have spent about $1000 in property taxes and later sold it for a hefty gain.
hmapkz0,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,We are squarely in the 12% bracket with a gross income of 100k.  Married filing jointly=25k deduction=75k before any taxes and other deductions are taken out.
hm9qn1i,FairyDustSailor,11/27/2021,1,If you don‚Äôt get paid promptly after that your state‚Äôs department of Labor is your next stop. They probably have a website and each state has a process for filing a ‚Äúwage claim‚Äù. That‚Äôs the legal process for filing a complaint when you have not been paid. Each state has different rules but in most states there are penalties to employers when the state has to intervene.

hmayub5,burritodiva,11/27/2021,1,My partner and I just bought a house last year mid-pandemic. Had originally been looking at $175-200k houses with a combined income of ~$90k until I went on partial furlough due to covid. We ended up purchasing a $165k home ~$1100 mortgage payment.  Since then we‚Äôve both gotten promotions And then I got a new job with a higher income. We now have ~$120K combined income.  A bigger yard nicer kitchen and extra bathroom would be nice but we don‚Äôt even fill the house as it is with just us (3br 1ba). Our mortgage and incomes leave us in a position where we don‚Äôt have to think much about our grocery budget (although I do plan all our meals and shop at Aldi) can go out to dinner on a whim and don‚Äôt sweat over repairs to our home or vehicles. We plan to have children in this house and should be able to afford daycare without losing all our all our luxuries.  I‚Äôm looking forward to our next house (in 7-10 years we always say) but this one perfectly suits our needs for this season of life.
hmanpvc,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,Its not that its a bad house but it needs work that we arent willing to put into it. Its a tiny ranch with a soldiers kitchen no attic and no basement. She wants to sell it while were in a good market for selling and people are buying houses that need work. Not to mention that anything she wants to do to fix up the house before selling it is currently on her and not us financially. We want to expand our family in the next few years to have another child and feel like it would be better to move now when the burden of fixing and selling this house is not on us than to have to fix a ton of stuff in the house over the next few years on our dime and then try to sell it. Shes also made the comment once or twice of not wanting to sell it to us because she doesnt think its a good family home. Living here comes with the additional con of slightly toxic mother in law This was my house and I expect you to upkeep it in the same way I would have comments and arguments (which for the record we work hard to maintain a clean house with 3 animals and a baby and my mother in law could find a speck of dust and berate us for not keeping things clean to her standards). I know if we bought the house that technically wed have the argument that it is no longer her house but shes the type who will still make the comments and its not something either of us want to deal with.  If push came to shove and this was our only option there would be worse fates than buying this house. But theres a long list of reasons we do not want to buy this house and have to deal with the inevitable issues that will need repair before we could sell it again.

hma4vpp,badlero,11/27/2021,1,The landlord hasn‚Äôt just noticed now. The OP says the landlord has been asking for the money since early this year.   I‚Äôm honestly surprised the landlord has been letting this continue this long. With the bank not being able to confirm the money has been paid it‚Äôs obviously the bank‚Äôs error since banks track all money leaving and entering. Cash paper checks echecks wire transfers bill pay doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs tracked and has confirmation numbers for every step of the way.   Pinky promises that a checked cashed is a great cause of concern and points to who fucked up. Now they aren‚Äôt willing to make it right with the landlord so the OP needs to while fighting to get the money from their bank.

hmaa9ky,ThisIsAMonere,11/27/2021,1,I was on Verizon for 20 years and one day one of those commercials just convinced me to take a peek at T Mobile. Since a phone company cannot legally make you change the phone device you use or the phone number you have to switch anymore and since yearly contracts are a thing of the past I decided I‚Äôd try it for a month and switch back if I wasn‚Äôt satisfied.  Prior to switching I was paying about $100 for one line I believe. I now pay $110 for unlimited for 2 lines and that comes with free Netflix and free MLB TV both of which my husband and I had been paying for before we switched.  It‚Äôs at least $1500 a year in savings since we switched.  Try it out if the service is decent in your area! T mobile May very well be the best provider out there right now. (I don‚Äôt work for T mobile I promise).
hma3ldn,tdp5150,11/27/2021,1,Make sure you have a cash cushion before you buy a house. And good rule of thumb is too keep your mortgage balance to 2 to 3x your total income which you are well within. There is a real risk of being to cheap with your house and having to move in a few years (and in turn eating the commission).

Not because of a line of credit or overdraft but because being member-oriented most CUs process deposits first then debits.  Some banks are known for ordering operations in the way that maximizes fees (even to the detriment of the customer). A decent credit union will help their members minimize overdraft fees.  Next my friend you need to get yourself out of the situation where one slip like this could cost you fees. Decrease expenses and/or increase income.

hm8u2p6,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,2,Good question. Right direction with the way I am thinking about real estate investments primarily and if financially now is the right time purchase a rental home valued 1.5 times the value our primary residence. All while looking for land to purchase in a different state. Should we grow our emergency fund? Is taking on a loan of that size too risky right now even with the likelihood of a tenant should we be okay with what we have and focus on our brokerage account and maxing out our 401k/403B when neither of us have a match etc.  Our goal is to hit $1M at our disposal for whatever we want without it being contingent on assets we hold like a rental home. Just our money we can pull from our brokerage checking and savings accounts. We see the equity in our home and the money we can make in Austin as a major vehicle in getting there while it‚Äôs still our home state.   Hopefully I explained that better. I am overwhelming myself a bit. Not sure if everyone else got anxious about finances within the first year of marriage. I just want to lay a super solid foundation.

hmawp3g,boredprogrammerguy,11/27/2021,1,My wife and I got married at 23/22 almost immediately out of college. Wedding was under $5k most of which we got back in practical gifts for our new apartment together. Engagement ring was only $1400 wedding bands were under $500 each. and honestly looking back we should have done non traditional rings and saved a couple thousand but hey at least it wasn‚Äôt a $10000 ring budget I guess.  Your sister has some weird ideas about marriage. I agree that you should not marry someone for financial reasons but working together to pay bills isn‚Äôt exclusive to marriage. Just make sure once you‚Äôre married all of your financial goals are in alignment. It‚Äôs no longer ‚Äúyour‚Äù and ‚Äúmy‚Äù money but ‚Äúour‚Äù money.

hm9pfmv,raika11182,11/27/2021,1,Make sure your retirement is invested in an appropriately aggressive fund for your age. You have time to ride the highs and lows.  With a loan from an IRA youre not usually taxed but if you stop paying it back the remainder of the loan will count as a distribution and youll be taxed 10% for early withdrawal I believe. However this might be different with Roth IRAs and I dont have a lot of experience with them. Hopefully someone else can chime in for that question.
hm9jh9d,TOPDAWG21,11/27/2021,1,Id hope anyone would work to pay off their student loan as fast as they can. I paid mine off a month after I finished college I paid a whole less than 50 bucks than they give me.
hm9tolb,aushimself,11/27/2021,1,If your rate is low on the mortgage it makes sense to invest the additional funds in the IRA as you have limited time to do that.  Edit: compound interest is a blessing down the road

hma3ytm,Bspy10700,11/27/2021,1,See the thing is I‚Äôve never had any issues with credit cards ever I‚Äôve never carried a balance on them ever and had $20000 in credit by the age of 19 somehow and then I pulled a couple grand out at the bank before I left to travel to have cash on hand when I landed to exchange an pay for things easily but while I was at the teller I asked to pay of my card balance of $70 and leave $100 in my savings just in case I needed cab fare or something when I came back to the states to get back home we‚Äôll turns out the teller never paid off the card and so my monthly payments to the card was taken from my savings account anyway I tried to dispute it and it was passed on because it was past 90 days   When I travelled next I couldn‚Äôt find a job anywhere which was frustrating living in another country not able to get a job I‚Äôd drop off resumes for hours each day revisit the following couple of days I‚Äôd take the train out of the city and try smaller suburbs but the issue I had was nobody wanted to higher only under the table so I worked so many under the table jobs I can‚Äôt even remember and it would be like passing fliers out for companies washing cars or doing dishes to name a few but at the end of the week I‚Äôd only make out with $170 usd after the exchange rate which covered mostly rent and I would eat pasta and or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for pretty much the whole year while saving money up for a plane ticket then once I had to pay rent early on in my trip so I used a credit card because I saw no work but had a call back for a job the day before and went to the interview they said you‚Äôre the perfect candidate for our second interview with the main hiring manager in a couple days when they fly back in (I got screened by the assistant manager) but I don‚Äôt know what happened I never got a callback and once I showed up a day after a couple days all I was told was the position was filled‚Ä¶ so throughout the year I was lucky to save around $20 a week and lived off of $1-5 (my plane ticket back to the states cost $570) But because that stupid interview that card got canceled and went to collections.   Anyway now after being back in the states I rebuilt my credit never carrying a balance on a credit rebuilding card for a year with only access to $300 now that was ridiculous so I just had it set up for automatic payments for my phone bill and that was it never used it for anything else as my bill was only like $70 and under 30% of my usage in doing that I went from a 560 to a 700 by the end of the year so I got another card because I was tired of not being able to make money back when I spend like how I used to be able to so got a cash back card and then once I got married covid hit and my wife was a certified nursing assistant and the news rules put into place made work near impossible in the area we lived so she tried finding something else she would enjoy and hopped between 3 jobs within 4 months and I think saw a total of 3 months not working and 6 jobs overall within the whole year I worked 2 jobs and went to school full time but she was really depressed as well and began a spending frenzy so I had to start paying on her cards and she felt bad so she sold things I bought her like a Michael kors pusre timberland boots etc and she even sold her car all the while i was paying all the bills and rent majority of the year but now she‚Äôs back to doing what she loves and helping me pay my cards off   I good with credit in my opinion just have had really bad luck but have never missed a payment since my traveling days and am on my way to working back to a better score but I asked about this card because it offers a nice percentage back on categories for when I‚Äôd use it in the future but I‚Äôd use the intro offer to transfer my balance to it on my highest interest card of $1100 and then pay my two cards off within the next two weeks and then pay off the ‚Äúnew card‚Äù by the end of January

hma16tp,fullactualization,11/27/2021,1,Sounds like you‚Äôre in a relatively stable financial position but have a couple major expenses coming up (I recently found out from friends that having a child is EXPENSIVE!!). I‚Äôd still recommend contributing up to the Roth IRA limit if you think that makes sense for you. Yes so by contributing I meant putting X% portion of my paycheck - I just adjusted timing of my ‚Äúcontribution‚Äù so that I contributed 100% of my paycheck into the Roth IRA initially (then stepped down mid year) rather than the automatic fixed monthly 5-30% that most folks do.
hmax669,tdaddybxl,11/27/2021,1,Exactly. Donate it for conservation and split the tax bennies.
hma7cye,bbh42,11/27/2021,1,If you don‚Äôt already get on a written budget.  I give my wife and I a monthly allowance that we can spend on anything.  We each get $60 per paycheck so $120 a month.  Most of the time we don‚Äôt spend it so we save it.  Both of us just paid cash for new Apple Watch 7 s from our allowance savings.  For other larger wants I set up a category in my budget and then fund it over time.  What I find is after a month or two we may decide we don‚Äôt want that item so we‚Äôve eliminated a lot of impulse buying.    But if we still want it having the cash on budget helps eliminate the fear of spending.  Just start small fund the want and go buy it.  Overtime the feelings will subside as you focus on only spending that category vs looking at spending as it relates to your overall account.

hma67gi,sozar,11/27/2021,1,I admin other things but the payroll application is what is deemed the most important. I‚Äôm expected to know how all of the calculations work on both the payroll and benefit sides and troubleshoot issues as they arise. Because of this I have to know both the payroll and HR rules because of the level of overlap in things like benefits. In a perfect world the payroll and HR departments would also know these things but in my company only the payroll side knows anything and I have to repeatedly teach HR their own policies.

hm8vb41,doktorhladnjak,11/27/2021,1,It‚Äôs 22% on the first million for the year then 37% on everything above that.  However employers usually have the option of withholding for the bonus as if it were ordinary wages too in which case it almost certainly will be withheld at 37%. You‚Äôd need to ask the employer what they do and if they offer any options for the withholding (unlikely but possible).

hm99zen,bearjing,11/27/2021,1,I would max out your match first. But keep it as cash in the account till you build up to your desired emergency savings. After you hit that then invest the rest. If you do an early withdraw youll have to pay a penalty but with the matching from the company youll still come out ahead. Though this is assuming the company match is vested immediately.  Normally it is bad to keep money as cash in your retirement accounts. But this is your emergency savings atm till you can build it up outside of your retirement accounts. And the most predictable time youll need the emergency savings is when the economy is tanking and you lose your job which is a terrible time to sell stock.  As for your student loans that depends on the interest rates of the loans and your personal risk tolerance. But you really shouldnt be paying them while they are at 0%.
hmbaa0f,atx78701,11/27/2021,1,well 1) it is an approximation. Actual calculations will get you an exact number. 2) it is 7.2 years so 42 years wouldnt be a full 6 doubles.
hm9p8s6,my_new_throwaway106,11/27/2021,0,25% of the purchase price for closing costs?  Does that include the money down?   You can pull up to the amount you contributed to the Roth with zero penalties except you cant take the retirement savings tax credit for a few years.  That wont give you everything but its a start.
hm9wyw9,No-Inflation-842,11/27/2021,1,One should compare current variable yield to inflation indexed yield on the bonds traded by institutional investors.    The large investors are paying the government to get similar inflation protection as yields are negative (5 year is negative 1.8) https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/ on Nov 26).     Series I can be redeemed earlier and at par so you know your downside compared to the big shots at the institutions (if negative 1.8 rate turns positive 1 the loss in market price will be 10%+ ).    Market is not efficient here and the small saver is getting at least 10%more  over 5 years than the buyer of inflation linked bonds in the institutional marketplace.    The roughly exact calculation is 3.55 (6month)  guaranteed plus 0 (guaranteed or possibly higher) versus negative 1.8 over the next 4.5 years.
hm9pi0q,ozzie-oswald,11/27/2021,1,These market drops can be scary! It‚Äôs all part of investing. 401k is a long term investment so a day two or a few of down days won‚Äôt do any harm. I‚Äôm guessing you picked an auto managed account with medium risk based on you‚Äôre saying about yourself. This will be pretty safe. Keep on adding to your retirement and avoid looking at the balance too often.

hm919gc,SnooCauliflowers3903,11/27/2021,1,Do you have to sell it to rebalance
hm9obtg,raika11182,11/27/2021,10,If it were me Id pull from the stocks. Yeah the taxes are gonna hurt but with a regular stock portfolio theyre going to hurt no matter when you sell. But the whole point of investing in stocks was to have more money in the end and liquidating those assets to put a down payment on a house is a pretty reasonable balance. Why have $115k in stocks if youre never ever ever ever gonna use that money?  Id leave the Roth alone because you dont pay taxes on those gains if withdrawn at retirement age.  Also break out the calculator and find out how much PMI is. Theres a chance that enduring PMI for an undersized down payment for a while might cost you less money in the long run!
hmae9as,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,Go online and lock down your credit profiles even if you dont have much of ones. Your SSN is forever. One day your identity will be valuable to someone and you must assume its out there now.  Start by calling the little number on the back of your debit card or going into a branch and tell them there are unauthorized charges and your card information was stolen. Shut down this account and open a new one. File fraud charges with your bank. File a police report. Both of these will protect you down the line if theres ever a question about your identity and credit.   Never keep your SSN in your wallet. Treat it like its the most humiliating photo ever taken of you and keep safely hidden away    Lets talk about you using the term friend. Youre old enough to understand that friends ask for help they do not steal from you. If you are uncertain you have to decide if this person you suspect is worthy of the benefit of the doubt while altering your behavior around them possibly forever in order to protect yourself.  If you are pretty certain give the name and why you believe them to be the thief to the bank and law enforcement. (I assume from your description youve seen these photos or were informed by someone who has. That doesnt really leave much room for doubt.)  This is a tough lesson. Learn to be more vigilant with your valuables identity and financial information -- even with friends.   Good people do bad things everyday in this world. None of us are our worst mistake  thank goodness. But being a good person isnt a guarantee of them being a safe person. Remember that going forward with future friends. Goodness is often unrelated to bad behaviors.   This friend if the thief is dangerous to your valuables. If you must interact with them remember that. Honor their humanity in those interactions but never turn your back for a second.   I am so sorry this happening to you like this. But be gentle with yourself. Youre entitled to be young and inexperienced believing the best of people. You didnt create the thief. You simply allowed yourself to be too vulnerable to theft -- a thing easily rectified.  Betrayal of trust is one of the more disconcerting life lessons but you will get through it and better for it.   Best wishes  Signed someone whos kids are more than a decade older than you.
hm9tzuh,StillMaterial5215,11/27/2021,1,Do. Not. Look. At. Your. 401k.  (Ok maybe look once a quarter)  Set it and forget it. I have several accounts but my main account that I started in August 2008 is booming. However like you I checked it constantly especially after the stock market crash the next month. I was told to stay with it and that‚Äôs what I did. 2010-2020 was great for me.   Just wondering how old are you?
hm9jl8l,PersonalBrowser,11/27/2021,2,I agree with the general sentiment that the 50/30/20 is a made up tool that exists to help people waste less money. So good on you for getting beyond that point.   In terms of what to do with your extra money the investment category should include retirement savings with maxing your 401k and IRA (or whatever the equivalent is if you live outside the USA) and then usually taxable investment accounts if you still have money left over.   Long terms savings like holidays - eh holidays I‚Äôd count like personal spending but long term goals like a house or car or whatever you usually will just keep in a savings account.

hma74z4,zludderz4707,11/27/2021,1,Thank you for the very informative response based on hands-on experience and what to expect furthermore.   When I first got this call I kind of figured they were going to lean on a renegotiation with the financial group but then I got to worrying that I might be subject to a much higher payment than what I was given at first. The payment given wasn‚Äôt favorable by any means but what I was able to afford readily and was around what I was expecting before walking in the door.   If any issues come up like the gentleman over the phone left as disclaimer if you don‚Äôt mind I‚Äôll provide an update with the specific details.

hmae4qt,Particular-Earth-453,11/27/2021,1,Spouse and I are trying really hard to keep our total food at $1250 a month between groceries restaurants and Costco. Over the summer we spent about $200 more a month than that - I blame the post covid environment lol. We were going out more than we should have.   The $1250 number includes meal planning meal prepping all my lunches and a couple lunches a week for spouse with a couple lunches out or a freezer meal on the WFH days for them. The going out includes probably 1 date night a month and a couple weekend lunches or take out dinners or we blow the budget. It sounds like so much money to me but everything is so expensive.
hmbdw9s,Remote_Cartoonist_27,11/27/2021,1,Donate to someone/a business who would be willing to make it suitable for buildings or make it a conservation project. Since it‚Äôs not a sale just an asset transfer the fees are low and the form is pretty simple to fill out you could probably do it yourself just have an agent/lawyer double check it so you or the recipient don‚Äôt get audieted
hmab6qo,Inevitable_Welcome23,11/27/2021,1,I would say save for longer/buy a smaller house. As that 10k would be worth around 80k when you retire.   Plus retirement contributions are statistically cut down significantly after a home purchase since a mortgage is only one of the many costs that go into owning a home. Most people buy a home that has a mortgage slightly lower than their rent but fail to realize that there are other expenses like property taxes insurance much higher utility bills (1.5-2x higher than an apartment) hvac/plumbing/foundation/leaky roof/other repair bills and the costs associated with purchasing extra furniture to fill the bigger space. So there will be no ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just invest more next year to make up for this withdrawal/401k loan‚Äù like many people assume there will be.   In fact in this market almost all entry level house are getting sold ‚Äúas is‚Äù so the sellers are getting away with selling houses with broken/nearly broken major house systems because they can. Waiting for the market to cool to get the same house for maybe 10-30k more in three years is not as bad of a deal if you factor in repair leverage that was a normal condition in contracts before 2020.  New HVAV: 10-20k New hot water heater: 5-10k Plumbing repairs: 500-10k+ Electrical repairs: 500-10k+ Foundation/structure repairs: 2000-20k Leaky roof/new roof: 500-15k+  There are more but buying right now is a huge risk right now due to the lack of inventory and repair leverage.
hm9xohb,Neatguyonline,11/27/2021,1,Why do you need a 20k car?  Are you paying cash or is this your budget for a 5/6 year loan?
hm9iwha,HarmoniousJ,11/27/2021,2,Regular savings if its something trivial like less than a year but really if you go regular savings theres no drawback to an HYA.  If longer than a year look at a bond (Or HYA savings if you still need a bit more liquidity)
hm9tyc9,tyclune121,11/27/2021,1,Thanks going to try a different bank!
hma3ci1,jachildress25,11/27/2021,1,A 401k is a decades long investment. It‚Äôs going to go up and down but in the long term it will grow. Even if the market drops 50% on Monday you will still come out way ahead by the time you retire.
hm9v1cp,Wahoo2K8,11/27/2021,1,Pretty much this.  Although OP can just sign the check over to the repair shop.  Sometimes that‚Äôs a little simpler.
hm9sms8,SamMarlow,11/27/2021,2,Yes what they did is allowable. You count as a plan participant if your funds are in the plan for purposes of fees and possibly requiring an audit so its in their interest to get you out of the plan if they can. They can do so if you have less than $5k although if you have between $1k and $5k they have to roll it over to an IRA in your name.
hm9f46d,Naive-Inspection,11/27/2021,1,The credit bureaus will not remove it. I never applied for this card and Credit One will not remove it. Thats a scam.
hmbd11x,lainey822,11/27/2021,1,Lets not forget that you chose to have kids and not want to share a house with people to lower your cost. In order to build wealth you need to live on less than you earn buy what you can afford and sacrifice to make it work. I understand the market very well.  I didnt make up this concept of 3x.  This is a well known rule in the financial literacy space.  Just because you are struggling and extending beyond your means doesnt mean you have to drag me down with you lol.
hmb07w8,stubbornkelly,11/27/2021,1,My household income is just a bit higher than yours and the payment on that mortgage amount would make me nervous. You could probably make the payment but your budget would be super tight everywhere else which would make it hard if not impossible to save for maintenance repairs and eventual replacements (eg appliances roof siding).
hmadvcm,Wolverinex5,11/27/2021,1,If you buy a house buy the smallest one you are comfortable with.
hm9wezm,nothlit,11/27/2021,1,Employer retirement plans generally follow a [pro-rata distribution rule](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/rollovers-of-after-tax-contributions-in-retirement-plans). For example if your 401k consists of 60% pre-tax balance (pre-tax contributions or earnings of any type) and 40% after-tax contributions then 60% of any distribution would be taxable.  As discussed at the link above you can (currently) do a split rollover where the after-tax basis goes to a Roth IRA and the pre-tax amount goes to a traditional IRA. That allows you to eventually take tax-free withdrawals from the Roth IRA without having to touch the pre-tax portion in the traditional IRA until you actually want to. However Congress is currently considering banning Roth conversion of after-tax amounts so this option may be short-lived.
hm9fmbh,Desert-Mouse,11/27/2021,1,And the evidence for 4 year degrees being the path to success is getting weaker as well. Kids born today may want internships and a functional online portfolio to get into tech for instance. When I did it decades ago a degree was all the door opener I needed.
hmajd04,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,Of course you‚Äôre correct.  But I know you knew that already. 401k are not subject to FICA.   But 457‚Äôs are.  So‚Ä¶  I suppose OP could just multiply 7.65% by Total 457 and add that to the total taxable obligation.
hm9wb9x,ghostrecon11,11/27/2021,1,Just wanted to leave because people were leaving this year. I don‚Äôt hate my job
hmae9k1,Inevitable_Welcome23,11/27/2021,1,I would say check the loan to make sure it drops. There are plenty you just have to refinance to properly get out of the pmi. Which is expensive for a house as you have to pay closing costs and other fees to refinance like you would for buying a new home. It is best to get a loan without a pmi in the first place or make absolutely sure your pmi drops at 20% (not in 5 years or a percentage higher than 20% LTV).   It can be an option but that doesn‚Äôt negate the fact that the market is red hot and burning people right now  Edit: make sure the loan takes account of appreciating property values as banks will often keep your original appraisal value as the pmi basis (this makes you keep the pmi longer in a hot market)
hmankze,Annonymouse100,11/27/2021,1,Good point. But she needs to continue to not sign on any debt and they need to keep their assets separated.

hmau1fi,Buttigieg2032,11/27/2021,1,Yes more money always buys you nicer things. Houses in the $350k range are going to be much nicer than the houses in the $275-280k range too if you make the mistake to check them out too and reset your baseline to them.   Avoiding this impulse is how you build wealth.

hm8yotk,acealex69,11/27/2021,1,I had an ITIN for casino gaming purposes but I read it can expire? I don‚Äôt recall providing it when I got the card. The way Amex processes a global transfer is basically they ask for proof of address in the new country and just open the account based on the fact that you‚Äôre a customer somewhere else. Of course my US credit limit was nothing like my home country one but it went up fairly quickly.  It just so happened the card arrived as I was remodelling my home and with a $1k credit limit I once had to pay it off 4 times in one day! That seemed to have helped though! Thanks for the advice on the debt/credit ratio have taken the increase. I‚Äôll have call Amex and see how I‚Äôm registered with the credit bureau and hopefully that will be something I can take somewhere else to secure a loan or lease

hmadpbn,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,> would put us at 75k    Yeah youre comfortably in the 12% bracket for married filing jointly (for 2022 the bracket is $20550 to $83550). So every dollar you contribute now will have a potential 12% tax now whereas in retirement youll have a hefty $46450 of taxable income being taxed *less* than 12% so deferring at least enough that you can fill those lower brackets with tax-deferred money would be better than all-in for Roth.    Again this could all change with a large tax change but so could the rules for Roth before you get close enough to use it (without penalty).
hmai0ys,nexusprax,11/27/2021,1,I am willing to pay. if I pay and it is not currently on my credit score will it show up?
hma0id7,tdp5150,11/27/2021,1,What‚Äôs your combined income? What debt do you have? How much of an emergency fund do you have?
hma2aye,Firm_Bit,11/27/2021,1,> At what point this increase in allowed budget becomes lifestyle creep?  When you start spending more than you would have on your previous salary for non essential upgrades.
hmapkhn,Pemi1099,11/27/2021,1,To me that seems extremely excessive. The arrangement is REALLY simple.   - Home owner: Buys house has name on mortgage. Pays property taxes mortgage maintenance.   - Renter: Pays modest rent maybe 35-40% of PITI or less   Presumably the renter is getting a good deal on rent. Its cheaper for them than it would be to rent an equivalently nice space anywhere. They have no ownership of the space but they get a good deal. Home owner keeps the house and responsibility of the house in the event that they split. You dont need lawyers and contracts for this.   Buying jointly is where this gets messy because you cant both live there when you split but you both legally own the place.
hm9scbx,xaradevir,11/27/2021,1,20% federal withholding on the taxable portion of distributions is mandatory for any distribution paid directly to you.
hmajhg7,freya_246,11/27/2021,1,Pharmacy techs should be making at least 35k a year if she has been doing this for a decade in the same place she is probably making more. Are you sure she is only making 12k and that she doesn‚Äôt want to work there? I wouldn‚Äôt apply for jobs without her directly telling you to.
hmalybf,jaredp812,11/27/2021,1,Step -1 stop going deeper into debt to give your fianc√©e money. You‚Äôre borrowing from next month without paying for this month (‚Äúnot disciplined enough to do‚Äù Dave Ramsey isn‚Äôt really valid while you‚Äôre working up to 96hrs per week. You‚Äôre not focusing on finances but you‚Äôre plenty disciplined). You didn‚Äôt mention what you owe on the house cars other debts or what you are taking home from the job this will determine the specifics of your situation (including if you need to lose the house for now and go back to renting until you stabilize yourself).   Step 0 get focused on finances. Make a budget with every dollar that you expect to make for December planned out to go to something specific. If you need a coat/shoes to make it through winter include that otherwise you need to pay the absolute minimum on every single thing and save up the rest as the beginning of your buffer to protect you from unforeseen circumstances.   Step 1 save 1 or 2 thousand so that there is a little money you won‚Äôt have to add to your credit card debt if a 1 or 2 thousand dollar emergency comes up. This is not mathematically optimal it is purely psychological it serves as proof  that the system is working. You‚Äôre not merely lowering your debt total you are increasing your net worth. Do not underestimate the power of psychological mechanisms.   Step 2 start paying off all debt but the house. Once your credit cards have been addressed you could revisit the ‚ÄúI pay my fiancee‚Äôs bills‚Äù plan if you want. Remember fasten your own oxygen mask before assisting others: you won‚Äôt be a great spouse if you bring 5 digits of high interest debt into the marriage that you aren‚Äôt actively addressing no matter how many dishes you wash or jokes you tell.   Step 3 pay off the house and save up a rainy day fund. The size of the fund will depend on your risk tolerance your job security your life plans etc but the necessity of the fund is nonnegotiable. The average American has a $10k emergency ~once per decade I believe. If you don‚Äôt want to be back in this same exact position in 10 years‚Äô time prepare for the emergencies before they happen.   After that the world is your oyster! Wanna save up and get a boat or a new car or stocks&bonds or whatever else under the sun?? Once you pay for food utilities transportation and taxes every other dollar you earn is now funny money!!! Don‚Äôt forget you need to plan for retirement unless you trust the government to cover all your expenses (hint: check the birth rate demographics of ~20-40 years before you retire as that is who will be paying those retirement taxes to you). If you have/expect kids and are like most parents you probably want to put something aside for their future beyond what you put aside for your own. Other than that the only thing left for you to do is live a great life without any more financial stress!!  Edited for formatting
hm8yswc,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,1,Yeah so I guess nothing short term then except kids. But we would still be living off my husbands income. That will remain our mindset forever. 1 salaried income household always.  Regarding the rental. Do you thinking upgrading to a DT rental for more cash flow is something to consider? Or should I be content and continue managing our rental and current home and focus on financial growth and savings?
hm9rl75,Pass_Little,11/27/2021,1,First of all  you might want to post your portfolio and options in your 401k over at r/bogleheads after reading the stuff either in the sidebar or the about tab depending on how youre accessing reddit.  That group is excellent with helping people make sure theyre invested in a proven portfolio suitable for long term growth.  There are some non-obvious ways to mess this up.  One common gotcha in a 401k is not being aware of the fees that youre being charged on the specific funds youve chosen.  For example some target date funds charge far more than they should and picking lower cost options can net you many thousands of dollars.   Assuming you havent done something silly investment wise  the best advice I can give you is to keep contributing and only check on it enough to make sure your contributions are making it in the account and theyre being actually invested in your desired funds.   The market goes up abs the market goes down.   In the long term it has always gone up  even if there are some multi year periods where it went down.    Because no one can know when these peaks and dips will occur the best solution is simply to continue to contribute each month and do your best to ignore what is happening in the right now ans focus on the future.
hmawalj,Icy-Regular1112,11/27/2021,1,I tend to agree with your sister but not for the same reasons exactly. People change a LOT between 22 and 32. Sometimes you can get married and change together in the same way(s) and sometimes you change and move apart. I generally recommend getting into your 30s before getting married or buying a house for that reason. Flexibility and the ability to grow into yourself and your career is important. For example if you get offered your dream job across the country and your spouse has their dream job already it can really hurt your finances (and your life satisfaction) because someone has to sacrifice their full potential.   Sharing expenses being married assuming both parties are on the same page and have good earnings will ultimately yield financial benefits (mostly by paying half on fixed costs like utilities and rent) but marrying young can have real downsides to career and growth opportunities.
hmaohcu,Background-Two1190,11/27/2021,1,Mine was at a hospital for a Er visit and they did it on there own but to expedite it just go talk to them.

hm9yspi,zacce,11/27/2021,1,> Or have him get his own plan? Seems like his own plan would be more costly    FYI My annual plan with Tracfone costs less than your 4th line monthly $50 bill. There are many low priced cell plans that will suit his needs.
hma3hg8,DirtyWaterDaddyMack,11/27/2021,1,1% of $52k = $520/yr...  Increase from 3% to 6% = ~$1500/yr Take home pay decrease = ~$1200/yr or $50/pay  If youre not contributing anything yet youre looking at a cost of $100/pay for a 50% match. Youre spending $2400/yr to invest $4500/yr that will compound.  Passing on a match of $1500/yr isnt the worst thing in the world for the short term but it wont give you $10k in a savings account anytime soon. Get the maximum match ASAP.  Buckle down and cut your monthly spending. In 5 years youre only regret will be not saving more. .
hma2acz,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,That makes sense.  Thank you!  Yes kids are expensive which is why weve waited so long to try and have them (Im 27 husband is 28- at this rate Ill actually have the kid at 28 husband will be 29).  Im very type A and want to be a prepared as possible for well just about anything.
hmaqz85,gammaradiation2,11/27/2021,1,Marriage can be as cheap as filing for the license. Marriage can have tax benefits especially if one earns way more than the other. Marriage makes access and power of attorney much easier in medical emergencies.   Marriage legally is just a step above domestic partnership.  You do not need to be self sustaining before getting married. In fact in most HCOL areas that rarely happens. At least if you consider self sustaining renting without roommates.
hm8vsd5,RedalMedia,11/27/2021,4,There are two approaches to managing your finances 1. Reduce your expenditure 2. Increase your income.  I believe you have almost maxed out on approach #1. Yes you might squeeze in a bit here and there in cheaper cellular plans or lower rent but the gains would be nominal at best.  You HAVE to increase your income. I have total respect for teachers but you are simply not earning enough. You actually cannot afford 2 jobs. If you must do one it must pay upwards of 70k for you to escape poverty. Here comes the tricky part. How? Maybe get a higher paying job at a private school maybe start a YouTube channel on the side maybe join one of those places that teach the corporate world (many make a good amount).   I wish I knew more about your education interests and skills to give better recommendations. But you know what YOU know yourself better than anyone. Find out what you love to do what youre good at and what pays a ton of cash and start down that path. It will take time but it will be worth the effort.  And another thing you need to get into the mindset of wanting to be wealthy. Kids are effing expensive everyone knows that. At minimum you need a financial plan for 18 years per child. You had kids when you couldnt afford to. Great emotional decision for you bad personal finance one. Bad emotional outcome for the children as well.   >Ive accepted that life is going to suck until I graduate and probably even after that  Why and for how long? If its for a couple of years after grad then fine. Else graduation isnt a cookie you eat on a cheat day . If your graduation cannot reasonably guarantee financial success (maybe not in the short run but at least in 5-10 years) then is that graduation even worth it? Money isnt everything in life but it is also not nothing. If your mastery of the subject barely pays survival income then is it really something worth mastering. I mean I could become a master in wheel inventing (if some Uni offered it) but it wouldnt pay anything. Why? Because it isnt worth mastering.
hm9a8ge,okiechuckd,11/27/2021,0,Great point. This is the 4th car we‚Äôve purchased from this dealership and the first time something like this has happened. Not a great experience.
hm9fmsx,tjkul,11/27/2021,-2,Seem fair to me. Especially you get cash. But If you think you do more and not happy with the pay ask for increase. Question is: how much more you think you should get pay? It don‚Äôt hurt to ask. But pls know that this is also a tough time for everyone. Cost of good has gone up (some double) in everything and it hard for many business owner as well. Sometime people see the $$ and thought business owner making so much and why am I making so little but they actually don‚Äôt understand how much expense is each month.
hmags8s,SquareGrouperCapital,11/27/2021,1,I‚Äôd like to keep it fairly liquid
hm92qgp,TheQuaeritur,11/27/2021,1,I would sell the car for many reasons.  1. Your debt is the worst kind of debt (credit card.) You are most likely being hammered with interest rates  so any amount you can throw at the principal will have a huge effect in the long run.   2. You have accumulated this debt over ten years of living above your means. The journey out of debt wont be easy. Any action that disrupts your old patterns (like becoming a one-car familly) will help change your spending habits.   3. It is a great time to sell a used car !  4. If shit happens (jib loss disease...) you will be in a safer place with less debt than with a second beater parked in your driveway.
hmaby9t,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,If your combined income puts you in the 22% or higher tax bracket now might review the Prime Directive section on Roth or traditional as well as this: https://www.gocurrycracker.com/roth-sucks/
hmaazx1,TheImpossibleWhovian,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the info. We are hoping to be in this house for a long time but are trying to be realistic that we may want to move again to a better school district down the road when we have more kids or have more money. I know logically that buying this house doesnt mean well be here forever but its definitely something to consider between the loans.
hma93a1,nails_for_breakfast,11/27/2021,1,How is your quality of life? Would having more money to spend make you less stressed or more happy over all? Do you find yourself longing for things or missing out on experiences that would bring you genuine joy because they are just out of your financial reach?  If not then just keep on keeping on. Personally I see crypto investments as dicking around money so maybe just hold what you have so far and use that money for fun experiences moving forward.
hma2hx6,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,Yes those credits have been helpful this year and theyre the only reason I have any savings now. Im not sure what will happen next year. Have they decided yet whether those will continue? Also I currently claim both kids for taxes because I literally pay everything for them and have them 90% of the time but my ex is fighting me wanting to claim one for himself (eyeroll) so Im not sure what will happen.
hmanxmc,lost_in_life_34,11/27/2021,1,Probably have to go into r/credit to get the wording for a nasty letter quoting the law
hmaoj83,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/27/2021,1,Obviously controlling unsustainable spending is #1 priority but refinancing at current historically low mortgage rates to pay down high interest credit card debt is very sensible.  0% credit card balance transfer could also work but only if you can pay off the cards in that timeframe.  Otherwise you will be back to high interest rates and low mortgage rates may be gone.  Good luck.
hma27pw,WolverineTherapy,11/27/2021,1,At $98k income you can afford more than $1000/month toward that CC debt.  You can kill that debt by January.  Babies are expensive.  Buy a Sams/Costco membership for formula and diapers - theyre not cheap but buying in bulk helps.  Clothes toys doctor bills they add up.  You want to bring the baby into the world with no non-mortgage debt.  Fun fact - at $114k mortgage balance you can have no mortgage in about 8 years if you threw your travel funds at the house.  Also everything is negotiable especially when youre an adult.  Youre 30 now.  Absolutism is for 20-somethings and 70-sonethings with nothing to lose.
hm9q7in,_NationalRazor,11/27/2021,2,I dunno man they needs cash on hand NOW. I get what youre saying its sound advice but theres no way Im taking that bet with only 2 weeks of living expenses in the bank
hm9lpdw,my_new_throwaway106,11/27/2021,1,I totally get your anxiety.  I remember when I learned about the 30 year mortgage and I nearly fell out of my chair.  On the other hand by and large we can have a very high quality of life compared with most people who lived because we can borrow money which is basically signing away our future labor and income to buy something now but unlike a fancy car or a vacation this is something which will serve us well for many years and increase in value.   Ive also seen the opposite - folks who rent all their lives and then towards the end dont have any assets to show for it.  It isnt pretty and has far more anxiety than what you are probably feeling now.  The idea of borrowing money for 30 years is pretty intense.    Overall houses tend to appreciate so its both a place to live and an investment.  The good news is that the mortgage payment itself doesnt change (taxes and insurance and other stuff will increase over time though) so as your income (hopefully) increases and as inflation erodes the value of money in several years you will look at your mortgage compared to the then current rent and be extremely glad that you purchased.   With your income and the money you have you can likely get something very nice that will be good for the present and good for the future especially if you have in mind to have a family.  That of course is a very personal decision.  So if you get a family house now it will feel too big but if you get a one bedroom or something now just for you in some years it will feel very cramped.   You can do the math all over the place.  If you put more money down now you have a lower payment (good move).  If you put less money down now you have a higher payment but can keep that extra money in the investments.  For your own home in many places you can put like 5% down so thats 25K if youre talking about a 500K house.  Not bad really.  On the other hand you can have a lower payment if you put down 20% (or more).  The lower payment is nice for peace of mind regarding the future.    If you want a little motivator try to research home prices in your area in the past.  How have they fluctuated over the past 20 or 30 years.  Now think and realize that you are in the past and your future self and your kids will look back at the home prices now and be glad you bought.    Please trust us when we say that you are in a good spot financially.  Please trust yourself that you will have the continued earning power to be able to do this.    A little about me and my story.  I bought my first home in 2008 when I was 31.  I bought it for about $200K.  It is now worth $400K.   I have refinanced once and save on the monthly mortgage because of that.  I had to move and its rented out and has been so for some years.  So for the last several years someone else has paid the mortgage and we get a little income and the house has increased in value.  So all in all I have about $1M in houses and about $700K in loans giving me $300K in equity.    A few years ago I bought a second home a smaller townhome as an investment.  It was $200K (in a different market).  Again someone else is paying the mortgage I get a little income the house has appreciated about 50% in the last few years.    I bought a third home about a year ago and live in it.  Its $400K and I pay the mortgage.  It is also appreciating.  The neighborhood was built in 1994 and there are still original owners here.  Their monthly payment is stupid low because the houses were about $150K when they bought them. They raised their kids in the houses and now they are empty nesters.  They have a ton so equity (if they didt take out massive loans) and some just plan on staying here.     So for me a lot of it is a matter of faith and trust that you can continue to make the payments and the system we have remains solid.    Good luck
hm9j8jp,FN2187_JEDI,11/27/2021,2,>It‚Äôs funny to me when wealthy people are ‚Äúterrified‚Äù over money matters.  I think once you get to that point in your financial life youll understand what OP is dealing with. Some never do. Some dont strive for it. Some just arent fortunate enough. Regardless its easy for you to criticize what you dont understand.
hm9ny8h,RebeccaDSM,11/27/2021,3,You should STOP paying someone to complete your school work!!!!!!!   You are in a pickle they are likely going to keep blackmailing you if you pay them. That could go on I definitely.  They may or may not ever report to your school.

The fact he lacked the judgement and reached out to a customer shows he doesnt have the intellectual discipline to be working around the temptation of money.  You are doing him a favor by telling the manager because if you dont hes eventually going to give in and end up in jail for theft. Save his life a lot of pain by removing him from the temptation.  You NOT doing something here is going to hurt him long term. This is so absurdly inappropriate. He needs to be woken up.

hmak9k2,uhno28,11/27/2021,1,Like others said its what you make it. If one has debt and the other doesnt one person will be going to a worse financial state for example. However theres the upside of sharing expenses like housing bills and groceries which usually tend to be cheaper when shared (like with roommates).  In our case we married while my husband was still in college and I had a couple of years of exp in my field. We didnt spend more than a few hundred on our wedding neither had any debt and we share 100% of the same views on finances saving spending etc so in our case being married has been fantastic including financially. We have combined finances and we can afford a lot more than each of us could individually and when one of us has lost income for some reason weve always been able to withstand it with no problems due to living beneath our means (which is really hard to do when single unless you are making a lot of money ofc) and having the others income to fall back on.  The one thing I can say is that I couldnt imagine being this financially tied to someone if we werent COMPLETELY compatible money-wise. Marrying to someone whos a spender or who needs you to manage all finances because they are like a child with money then that would be a hard no for me.

hm9q7js,achieve_my_goals,11/27/2021,1,This is difficult without any more information. How much are you paying? How many rooms is the place? Where are you located? What access do you have to transport and how much do you need it? Is distance work a possibility for you?

hmam39s,FindFIREsomeday,11/27/2021,1,Hold your assets? I think thats the lesson there.   Dont panic sell.  Having an emergency fund is an important piece of being able to do that.
hmav4rn,93195,11/27/2021,1,I use my credit card for everything I can to get the rewards.  I typically pay a round number every week or so.  Whenever I think about it.

The stuff to the  left of the  plus sign is how $200K grows in 16 years.   The stuff to the right of the plus sign is the sum of a geometric series  which answers the question: ‚Äúif I invest the same amount each year and the investment grows by the same percentage how much will I have after N years.‚Äù  17 is one more than 16 because that is how the sum of geometric series works.    20500 is the 2021 maximum 401k contribution
hm9368m,applepiecorgi,11/27/2021,1,Look for exclusions part under your liability coverage and it should spell it out for you. [This wesbsite](https://locktonmotorsports.com/personal-auto-policy-guide/) has an example of what it should look like.  Edit - Since you‚Äôre OP. Yes to comp because is generally pretty cheap so I mean I would get it. And collision is a good option if you can‚Äôt afford to replace the vehicle. Don‚Äôt count on you/ your mom never being at fault for an accident or the other party having valid coverage that will cover your vehicle. Lots of people out there don‚Äôt have insurance/ don‚Äôt have enough insurance to cover all the damage they cause/ tell their insurance company they‚Äôre not at fault (which can become an issue for you if they believe their insured over you/ your mom).

hmba9j3,thememeconnoisseurig,11/27/2021,1,Appreciate the insight thanks. I didnt think about the different types of accounts. I have one closed SELF loan for credit building too from over a year ago.   I have mainly been just trying not to make my profile super suspicious by opening multiple cards at once.
hm9s4gd,KReddit934,11/27/2021,2,Because when you remove money from the pretax container  it becomes taxable...and the rules say they have to collect that for the IRS.  My suggestio .. do one or the other rollover full amount adding back the rest from your own money...or just eat the 10% as lesson learned...but dont do it 1/2 way.  At least its a small amount so if you decide not to roll it over its less than 100 loss.
hmaxyup,minnesotaguy1232,11/27/2021,1,Yes true. But depending on where it is sounds like it could be used for hunting. Hunting Land where I‚Äôm from (northern MN) goes for at least a grand per acre.

hm9iup8,PersonalBrowser,11/27/2021,4,r/churning  Literally a whole community of people that do it.  In answering your second question about what‚Äôs stopping you convenience time and money.   The process of opening a bank account changing your direct deposit (most promotions require you to have a couple direct deposits) and keeping $X for X days is a whole ordeal. For most people it‚Äôs not worth it for $50 a pop even if it‚Äôs multiple times a year.   The bigger bonuses usually require much more extensive tasks or larger deposits (aka $500 for $25k in your account for 6 months). At this point its usually cash on hand thats the limiting factor.   Personally I do it a couple times a year. I think capital one had a promotion that was $400 for an account with two direct deposits of at least $5k which was easy and then Chime did a similar thing for like $100. But there‚Äôs been a ton where it‚Äôs just not worth the time or effort.
hmannsb,Pemi1099,11/27/2021,1,Thats why Im saying to split toward the person keeping equity paying more. If the person renting is getting a good deal then if you break up they had a cheap place to rent.   Ideally the intent is they stay together and at that point just make the ownership joint.if a power dynamic is created because of this then the relationship probably shouldnt continue anyway.
hmaue5i,d_rek,11/27/2021,1,Yes check to see if state wildlife agency would consider it as a donation as well. Also I find it hard to believe 5 acres is only worth $1k even as werand
hmah13c,SquareGrouperCapital,11/27/2021,1,Both options are accessible just wasn‚Äôt sure if there was a better account out there to store the money
hmalmqs,HandyManPat,11/27/2021,1,Note that the hit will also include missing out on decades of future growth towards retirement. Thats hard to fully appreciate when young but retirement age tends to sneak up on a person speaking from personal experience.  My guidance is to complete the indirect rollover of the **entire** amount to your new employers 401k if allowed or to a personal IRA.
hmavcvo,DeBallZachBulls,11/27/2021,1,Where‚Äôs it at? I‚Äôll buy it for nature conservation.
hm9cmzc,radwagonier,11/27/2021,1,Will he and his wife be getting social security on top of that? They could be set up to live on $9k/mo (108k/yr).   Given that a Roth IRA might be a good idea since he might be in a high tax bracket in retirement (especially so if he becomes a widower).  Since he might not need this money to live on I might take on a bit more risk in terms of asset allocation.
hmav2wf,LooksAtClouds,11/27/2021,1,Oh no based on yours and others comments seems like its correct!

hmart01,MementoMori97,11/27/2021,1,Since its wetlands I would donate it to a local conservation group. Im sure you get a tax write off for that as well.
hmavusy,Anonymoose2021,11/27/2021,1,The multiple countries complicates matters but you have a few general possibilities to consider and review for each country.    One general strategy is to hold and invest the funds yourself and gift them to the children when appropriate.  To cover the possibility of your death before they are adults you would mention these accounts in your will and/or have them designated as the beneficiaries of the account.  The second general strategy is to gift to the children via their parents who would then manage and disburse them as they see appropriate.   The attractiveness of this approach is dependent upon the trustworthiness of the parents.  In the US and perhaps other countries there are custodial accounts.   Your nephews and nieces would be the beneficiaries.  The custodian or trustee might be either you or their parents.   These are effectively predetermined trusts with predetermined rules set down in law or regulations rather than being determined by specific trust documents.    Custodial accounts at banks generally have very low returns so you should look for brokerage companies that allow custodial accounts.   Be sure to understand the tax implications.  A trust is a legal document setting out the responsibilities of a trustee that manages assets on behalf of another the beneficiary.   The trustee could be a person or an institution.   The costs of a trust both the initial setup and continuing expenses make them most suitable for larger amounts than you plan to gift.  How trusts get treated and taxed varies widely between countries.   UK for example has well defined long established rules and laws regarding trusts while France only really recognized trusts in the last decade or two.  I know the above isnt a direct answer to your question but hopefully it gives a general overview of what to be looking at.

hmachsr,donniePump39,11/27/2021,1,I like the idea of income producing funds if that is what youre referring to as tax in-efficient however others above seem to disagree. May be due to my age and only having been in workforce for 4 years though. Do you have any recommendations that have worked well for you that I could research? Thanks!
hm8vdqg,Quirky-Ad-3400,11/27/2021,2,Don‚Äôt forget ibonds. They could be a very decent alternative to TIPS or STT.  https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod\_ibonds\_glance.htm
hmb2cly,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/27/2021,1,Make sure it‚Äôs the right person and you really want to spend the rest of your life together and grow old together.  Otherwise shortly after college is not a big deal.  We got married when we were your age we are happily married decades later.   Having a common understanding of finances is important as is having a common understanding of other important aspects of your lives like whether to have kids your values etc.  Your understanding of whether to fully join finances or keep them relatively separate (eg joint vs separate bank accounts) would be pretty important.  We take an approach of what either of us is fully jointly owned which worked when my SO was the bread winner and also when I became the bread winner.    With regard to credit cards though ‚Äî I think you are right if you pay off cards every month then credit cards are likely the optimal route (liability protection 2%+ back sign-up bonuses that can be over $1k).  I‚Äôd say marriage does not need to be expensive ‚Äî it‚Äôs more having children that is expensive (potential loss of income child care need for bigger house or in good school district private school / college etc.).  But also a great joy.

hma0akm,JustMeerkats,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for your reply!  I made a previous post about this if you want more details but quickly:  \-\~67k annually net (after all deductions)  \- 6 months worth of expenses in savings  \- Debt: We own our home with a mortgage.  We put in 1k/month actual mortgage is $815. We have two cars and the payments are $600/month for both.  No credit card debt finished paying off student loan debt in August of this year.  \- Husband needs some dental work done next year unsure of total cost just yet as he hasnt had his consultation with the oral surgeon until January.  I would guesstimate that it will be a few thousand dollars.  \- Trying to conceive currently.   \- Husband has applied to go back to school part time online.  We will have to rearrange some things should he get accepted and should he enjoy the program.   You can add a certain amount to your Roth in the beginning of the year?  I had no idea! I thought it had to be taken out of paychecks.
hmasbap,KAugsburger,11/27/2021,1,No improvements on the property and from the description it sounds like it would be difficult to get appropriate permits to build anything.  It isn‚Äôt worthless but it doesn‚Äôt seem likely you will be able to get significantly more.
hm9yrd8,aaaaij,11/27/2021,1,personally I would go with the advice in the sidebar which says something different - to first research and understand the pros and cons of Roth vs traditional in the context of your situation. Plenty of people have reason to prefer pre-tax savings which they cant get with a traditional IRA due to the income limit on the deduction also have good funds in their 401k.   For those people the priorities should be 1) get employer max 2) max out 401k 3) max out Roth IRA  We dont know if OP is one of those people or not

hmadesm,antifaction,11/27/2021,1,Yes the last step after all the debt over 4% is paid off and you are taking advantage off all the tax advantages accounts (401k IRA etc) then you need to start putting your money somewhere- for short terms goals maybe a CD or just a savings account but longer term savings should go into the market in the form of stocks- but don‚Äôt be tempted to play the market- just buy a reputable index fund with low fees. VTSAX is an example of one- it‚Äôs run by vanguard. The lowest buy in to get the admiral shares (lowest fee) is 3K.  If you can invest 30-40% of your income and have low expenses- you could have the option to be creative with your employment. The rule of the thumb is to be able to live off of 4% of your investment per year. You have at least six months before you would be in a position to start investing so you will have plenty of time to look into what to invest in.
hm928ut,WafflingToast,11/27/2021,1,Are you factoring in the monthly federal child care credits?  Shouldnt they kick in soon and take the place of your second job?
hmae19l,me_jus_me,11/27/2021,1,Yes and no. You just need to consider the ESG criteria. Not everyone has the same value system and the kinds of evil that tech companies are involved in is a little harder to pin down with objective criteria. But if you want to avoid fossil fuels guns and tobacco for example then the ESG funds do a good job of this. And you‚Äôre kidding yourself if you think that large companies don‚Äôt consider their inclusion in indexes and funds when making corporate decisions. This becomes more and more true the more popular that ESG funds/indexes get. Oil companies know there is no way they can be included but other companies with public profiles know they need to appease their shareholders and their image. Some of the more recent ESG efforts also involve getting positions on the corporate boards to help push the companies further with ethical practices.   So in summary don‚Äôt buy ESG if you don‚Äôt care about these issues but there are now some decent funds that resemble the broader market while excluding a number of obvious bad actors. And your investing decisions definitely make an impact on the world just like your choice to buy or not buy different products.

hmaplcf,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,Call the hospital have them help you apply for Medicaid. They pay for up to 3 months prior if qualified. If not qualified  apply for the ACA to prevent future $35K bills.   Negotiate and set up a payment plan with the hospital and physicians (often not included in hospital bill). Then set up a go fund me page.   If a small  rural hospital  you might try the hardball tactic of negotiating under threat of declaring bankruptcy where the hospital will likely never see a dime. Theyre pretty desperate and barely hanging on.   Im glad it wasnt serious. But you know very well next time it could be.   Seriously gi through the entire ACA process  right up to the final sign up screen. I bet youre pleasantly surprised at the cost after the advanced tax credits (often called federal subsidies).

hmbbdjs,Jabrichmond,11/27/2021,1,Thanks for the tips everyone. I forgot to mention that I recently got a job that pays 10K more a year than my last job. I already have a healthy amount contribution to my Roth 401K and HSA but will probably up the contribution now that I have more wiggle room.   As of now my rent and bills are already paid for the month of December and am sitting with $1200 in my checking account. I wish I felt good about being in this situation right now but for some reason I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt really have the urge to spend large amounts of money on things I don‚Äôt need like electronics or clothes nor do credit cards sound appealing to me.  I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that I was CONSTANTLY worried about my bank account balance when I was pretty deep in debt and I think in the back of my mind I‚Äôm worried that I will go down the slippery slope again even if I do budget or track my spending. I guess I find it hard to trust my habits as of right now.
hmaf5f5,zludderz4707,11/27/2021,1,I‚Äôm actually hopping from my financed Hyundai with a blown engine at the moment (that Hyundai wants to fight tooth and nail not to fix even on recall) to Honda for that specific reason the residual value and quality of Hondas in general. My brother had a 2018 Civic hatchback sport leased at a great deal and just ended his lease term last month which is what put me on the idea of choosing Honda with their proven service.  They showed me my credit score of 623 (TransUnion and I wasn‚Äôt happy to see it either hence cosigner supporting a 720 score and much better income) and presented me a payment of $474/mo without cosign this is with the 2022 Honda Civic EX at a 12K/36 month lease and my $500 down. I was expecting around $450-500/mo so I was aware of that high water boundary nonetheless merely due to my credit score. This was fine enough for me because it‚Äôs still within my means and serving definite purpose the car itself.   From myself walking in to leaving the lot with signed papers was around 2 hours and they did provide all of the money factors in that time. I‚Äôve informed my cosigner of what is at hand in the moment so if they have to step in upon renegotiation then shall it be in that assumption.   Some people might laugh at that price tag but the idea was to stretch away from my unreliable very used vehicles that are costing me just as much and launch my budget towards something more trustworthy and continuously brand new - so I thank you for the information regarding the possibility of ending lease early for a better price point because I hope to use this as a ladder to obtain such eventually.
hmagckf,HemingwayHuxley,11/27/2021,1,I figured I was behind and right now the financials are separate with bills coming out of a joint account.

hmb791l,NickOutside,11/27/2021,1,Your dedication to vacations is neither here nor there we all have our priorities. I would however encourage you to consider the types of vacations you take. If youre wining and dining across Western Europe $7k seems on point.   On the other hand there is a ton of fun to be had traveling to cheaper destinations. Two weeks visiting Costa Rica or Croatia is a joy. We tend to travel more backpacker style avoiding expensive hotels and limiting fine dining to a single evening. Otherwise we build our own itineraries and seek out all the national parks and street food we can find.  Your tastes may vary but you could potentially save an extra $3k or more by changing up your travel style. Food for thought.

Plus I‚Äôm married and my wife is going to school for something more lucrative.  If I was ever worried we would just move into an armpit state and be comfortable.   Living to work isn‚Äôt always the move.

hma23xc,Ecstatic_Assumption5,11/27/2021,1,I did manage to transfer my funds (minus the $4500) to my partner before I froze my account. This probably doesn‚Äôt matter because I will probably have to pay for the $3200 I sent them. I feel so stupid I was so desperate to find a job in my field

hmbjqj7,OvereducatedCritic,11/27/2021,1,I wont disagree with you on that marriage is a force multiplier but I will say its a risk for both people from the jump. People change and you wont always see why. On top of that I feel like its hard to make life decisions/big financial decisions without the second party present. I would sooner opt for me vs the world since its less complicated and Im not risking my assets or anyone elses when Im married to someone I dont know fully/am sued for an arbitrary amount of money or for my assets. A teammate can just as quickly become an enemy or a liability if they have ulterior motives/ dont communicate/ are good at lying/get sick/...the list goes on.  Creating a unit means you go down with the ship you built and from what I have been reading those repairs(divorce) are wildly expensive. I think its a smarter decision to pursue full financial independence because that money will make/break you no matter what.
hmb3e8g,Quality_Manager,11/27/2021,1,So are you saying most likely they will have to pay approximately 40%. So if they sell for 4 mill they will walk away with only 2.5?
hmb4oqf,taku2472,11/27/2021,1,Yes I did do this and the rates increased by quite a bit. Last two months have seen 100% increase on electricity and water has seen 200%. The reason I asked the company for rate is because this obviously does not make sense to me.
hmag9r3,Pemi1099,11/27/2021,1,Best bet Ive seen on the house is just to have 1 person own it and the other pay rent. Maybe 60/40 split toward the home owner so the person who actually owns it is paying more.
hmb2eb3,meliaesc,11/27/2021,1,I married my high school sweetheart immediately after college. Its my biggest regret.
hmb5jz4,VegasOldPerv,11/27/2021,1,The answer is yes paying this will affect your credit negatively.   Right now the debt is too old to be on your credit report. If you pay it then you restart the 7 year reporting statute. Which means you could suddenly have a >90 past due on your credit report and your score will drop precipitously.   If you feel obligated to pay this old debt contact the debt holder and make a deal in writing that the debt and payment will not be reported to any of the credit bureaus. they have no reason to not accommodate since as others have pointed out they have no legal way to coerce or force payment of this debt unless you reside in one of the nine states that allow for collection of debt longer than the 9 years that have passed.

hma73dx,Loutro-Fift,11/27/2021,1,Do you have a budget? Using a budget as a tool can help you track spending. You will be more aware of your spending and can plan for large purchases.

hmawfle,93195,11/27/2021,1,You can try to negotiate but you don‚Äôt have a ton of leverage.  I‚Äôm sure they have a lease requirement to notify you of rent increase or non renewal which they just did.  And like you said your lease requirement to provide notice of non-renewal is probably about the same.  Go talk to them Monday but you‚Äôll need to decide soon probably before you can get something else locked in.  Sucks I know.

hma07g4,bruce656,11/27/2021,1,They can be depending on circumstances.  If you recall the massive financial crisis we had in 2008 our banking industry isnt quite as regulated as it is in the EU from what I understand.  Some banks require a minimum deposit to open an account. Others will charge you a fee if you havent signed up for  direct deposit with your employer.  Many of them will require you to maintain a minimum account balance or they will charge you a fee. So theyll actually charge you money... for not having money.
hma93nl,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,> Im not sure what it means for any eventual divorce issues.  If divorce isnt on the table then it means nothing.  Even if divorce was on the table it still means nothing.  Because likely what youre getting at is Can my ex-husband steal the home from under me?  This is why divorce involves lawyers.  You get a lawyer to split the assets and claim your fair share.  Generally assets acquired after marriage are split 50/50.  Deviation from that can happen depending on individual circumstances and local law.  I would say go for whatever works out in your favor as a couple.  If youre worried about divorce its too late for a pre-nuptial agreement.  However though generally less strong you can indeed pursue a POST-nuptial agreement.    The intent of this document is to alleviate any fears regarding how to split assets in the event of divorce.  The bigger benefit is the discussions between the two of you that lead up to the document.
hm90sjg,cmoclk,11/27/2021,1,TX lender here.  Tell the lender what you want to do your expectations goals and fears. A good lender will want to do the new purchase as well so find someone you can talk to who will walk you through the whole process and develop the overall situation for you so you can go over your options and make an informed decision.  If you dont have a lender ask around for a trusted referral or take your chances on a marketing website like LendingTree (you will immediately receive about 30 calls so be prepared) and shop multiple lenders. Its always good to do due diligence and make sure youre getting a good deal by starting with a few different lenders. There is a grace period on your credit for mortgages so having multiple checks will not harm your credit scores beyond the first one.  If you can get qualified for the loan youre probably fine since the current underwriting system is very conservative and pretty much aims at worst case.  Also talk to a realtor about properties youd be interested in. Find a neighborhood or area that you can receive good rental income vs the new mortgage cost and make sure that its a good idea to even make the purchase.
hmb4svj,CluesLostHelp,11/27/2021,1,Do you have a budget?  Part of having a budget is setting aside money for things like new clothes etc. as well as having some fun money to keep your sanity.

hmau73e,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,I assume You were declined for having no credit history (a thin file) and the rep or their computers were lazy about giving you a decline reason.You may have had 6 decline reasons and they only told you the first.  You are using $0 out of $0 available = $100% or null utilization = Too much borrowing for a lazy system/rep  Either way just focus on getting your report established for the first time.
hm93q8h,Zookeeper1099,11/27/2021,1,You should never listen to people who give you percentage based rules never. It never works for everyone (in fact doesn‚Äôt work for most people)  You should first list out all the expenses that you MUST pay then list out the total amount that you are knowledgeable enough to consider as need and beneficial to have both of the amount that you can not reduce. Your goal should be saving everything left. Of course you want to once a while spend on things you want that‚Äôs when a monthly budgeting comes in handy. You should start with lower budget on the things you want and gradually make changes until you balance it out and settle on a mount you feel comfortable with then stick to the plan forward.  Personally my spending has never had anything to do with how much I make at the time. I only care and make sure every dollar I spend makes sense. Am I lazy enough to order delivery vs picking up to save $5? Do I really need a new computer? If I make sure every dollar I spent has gone through some level of decision not just spend without thinking I don‚Äôt need a % to save I don‚Äôt even need budgeting. Also I have never spend extra only because I started making more. Expenses should decouple from income.
hmaaqlc,nnndude,11/27/2021,1,Depends on what type of debt you‚Äôd be inheriting and the financial responsibility of your spouse.   A friend of mine married a guy who had debt and a horrible penchant for spending money they didn‚Äôt have. They‚Äôve since divorced and she‚Äôll be paying the financial price for being married to that guy for a while.
hm8vwjr,Action_Heroine,11/27/2021,1,Not to get too off topic but a guy I know from college did the same over $7000 in a really stupid way apparently to cover a gambling debt (or part of it anyway). It kind of amazes me that stuff like that or what the OP posted about doesn‚Äôt happen more often.
hmafjvz,RoastyMcGiblets,11/27/2021,1,I would just wait until he has 2 years tax returns as self-employed.   Taking SS early has huge implications and should not be done at the suggestion of a mortgage broker. Id even say fire that mortgage broker if he was trying to talk your dad into it.   He could apply at a local bank or credit union that holds loans rather than selling them. If your father has a good financial history and can show his construction business was profitable all those years they might approve him. He will pay a slightly higher rate since the loan cant be sold but it wont be awful.   If your finances are sound and your relationship with dad is good you might consider buying the house as an income property and renting to your father until he can qualify on his own.
hmaerlg,Default87,11/27/2021,1,odds are there will be fees to sell the AF mutual funds when they are within the vanguard platform.

hmaf557,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1,It doesnt need to be sophisticated. Investing in low yield bonds (early mortgage payment) is poor investment advice for a young person with ~40% disposable income.
hmas9mz,Old_Ladies_Die_Hard,11/27/2021,1,^ This! If you *quit* you may not qualify for unemployment. That‚Äôs state-dependent so you may want to research it.
hm8vqm2,Frankwillie87,11/27/2021,4,The way banks do debits and credits on your bank statement is from *the banks* point of view of your cash. They are entirely backwards from the rest of the financial world.  For you personally if the cash leaves your account you credit cash and debit rent expense in this example.  Assets and Expenses have a normal debit balance.  Revenues Liabilities and Equity have a normal credit balance.  Thats why Assets + Expenses = Revenues + Liabilities + Equity in double-entry accounting. If the asset (cash) goes down it is credited and something else (rent expense) is debited.

hm93lrb,islangmemes,11/27/2021,3,You do realize it doesn‚Äôt matter right? Once your earnings bring you over the next tax threshold the money you bring in after that point is taxed at a higher rate it‚Äôs not for overall earnings for the year.   A very common misconception is it‚Äôs your entire income for the year is taxed at the highest level you‚Äôd earn. There‚Äôs no way the IRS can predict that. People lose jobs change jobs get promotions etc. that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre taxed based on how much you‚Äôve earned for the year at any given point in time.  Tldr  keep working those extra shifts. Won‚Äôt hurt you.
hma7j7w,Mthawkins,11/27/2021,1,Probably less than 5k a month but definitely within two months. For spending not much travel (other than gas related to business).

hmaogwc,IcyChampionship3067,11/27/2021,1,If the friend is a sole proprietor filing schedule C the only way to lessen the SE tax of 15.3% is increase business costs.  Probably time to talk to a tax professional before years end. As to lowering actual income tax theres multiple vehicles to mitigate that. But again you need a tax professional now to get it done correctly before years end.  If its an LLC or something similar perhaps the business itself might be able to do so. But my answer still stands -- get a tax professional quickly to do whatever before years end.
hm9icbp,decaturbob,11/27/2021,1, - nope and again employers can set their own standards if they are more stringent than federal or state. Where I worked hourly everything over 8hrs in a day and over 40hrs in a week was 1.5OT and Sundays/holidays was 2OT ( hoiliday pay not included)

hm9fnee,fanboyroy1,11/27/2021,4,This biggest issue of getting paid ‚Äúunder the table‚Äù as we call it in the us is the liability of you getting injured on the job.   Employers pay payroll tax on employees as well as workers compensation that covers them if you get injured at work.

hm9twcl,Its-a-write-off,11/27/2021,1,Whats the total cost of the plan a month? How many financed phones? With 1 or 2 financed phone the total monthly payment should be around 200.00. But removing 1 paid off phone line wont reduce it by 50.00 as the basic plan is likely to be 120.00 or so and each extra line 10 or 20.
hma885g,Pezpal,11/27/2021,1,The best advice I can give you is to use a reputable brokerage firm that charges a fee. If it‚Äôs free you‚Äôre the product not the consumer. For example don‚Äôt use Robinhood.  Use Charles Schwab or a company like it where they have a fiduciary responsibility to the investor.
hmb6o8z,JeanATannen,11/27/2021,1,Almost everything about that post is strange but that‚Äôs ok.   No way I‚Äôd have 100k in crypto unless I already had about 1mil in a more traditional basket of index funds. But best of luck.
hmahmdv,MizchiefKilz,11/27/2021,1,Its $25 now but will always go up. Plus you need to have some liability insurance as well in case someone trespasses and gets hurt on it.
hmacleq,digitalhelix84,11/27/2021,1,The US banking system is exceptionally heavily regulated.  NACHA (US) and SEPA (EU) are more or less pretty similar.  Online bill pay will first look to see if the recipient is registered to receive the payment electronically if not they will mail a check to them. At first they would treat it like a check and debit the account when the check was cashed but people actually hated this because it was unpredictable. So they moved to debiting the accounts on the date the payment was promised by.  I cant really compare this to Europe but considering how much of bill payments are done this way vs the number of actual errors its pretty close to six sigma levels of accuracy.
hm9zjzy,JKiesewetterPhotos,11/27/2021,1,LOL! I guess that I forgot to consider the fact that hes not married to Verizon. Just would definitely want to be unlimited 5G. Hes in a large metro area so coverage shouldnt be an issue like it is for us sometimes on Marylands Eastern Shore.
hmaanoa,MDfoodie,11/27/2021,1,Yeah I think $28k annually on food is high.  Whether or not that cost is acceptable to you is a personal decision based on your financial goals and your ability to afford it.

hm9x077,strsystem,11/27/2021,1,Your dad isn‚Äôt giving you bad financial advice. Mathematically in terms of largest return hitting match is best but you increase your risk of basically becoming homeless with your 1.5k in savings. You‚Äôd have to move back home in order to support yourself if you lose your job or something else happens that wipes out your savings.   Some people are saying to put it in 401k and then loan against it in an emergency. That‚Äôs bad because you have to pay it back at a high interest rate. Even if it‚Äôs paying it back to yourself you don‚Äôt want to put yourself in a stretched situation where you might have to pay a penalty if you can‚Äôt pay it back. Sometimes you don‚Äôt have to pay it back but depending on the reason why you loaned it.   At the end of the day we‚Äôre talking about a few months to build your emergency fund. After you build it up you can continue to invest up to your match. I think the people that say invest to the match are thinking that you can depend on your parents if things go wrong to financially support you and help you get back on your feet. That‚Äôs not wrong but it really depends on whether you want to put yourself and your parents in that situation. In my opinion learning/trying to be self sustaining is the more responsible thing to do despite it not being the giving you the max financial ROI. This is probably what your dad is thinking as well. I‚Äôd have a different opinion if you had 6 months emergency fund already or if you lived with your parents and they like you there.
hmb7z8m,Mezzylu,11/27/2021,1,On a similar point sis might be thinking more like advising op to become capable of supporting herself before she ends up totally dependent upon her BF to make ends meet.   Once upon a time women went from parents to husband with no emphasis on self sufficiency. If you end up divorced after that you may find yourself initially helpless unless you get a big divorce settlement.   That being said having someone that has your back in everything financial and otherwise massively reduces the stress of life. Just be on the same page.
hmb3tql,Its-a-write-off,11/27/2021,1,Maybe more like 3 million since they probably still have some basis as well as selling costs. So Id roughly guess 1 million in taxes.

hmb227o,Fish-Weekly,11/27/2021,1,Are you sure it was a friend? It‚Äôs not necessary for someone to take pictures of your card to get a hold of your account numbers. This type of thing happens all the time. It‚Äôs also not necessary for them to have your SSN to post a fraudulent charge to your card.  As others have said call your bank (the number on the back of the card that was compromised). Tell them there is a fraudulent charge on the card for a purchase you did not make. They will investigate and almost certainly return your money.
hm9yoxk,Cstarr91,11/27/2021,1,What if you pay it off for way less like to a collection agency?   Like say I owe 30k and I work out a deal to pay $1000. What happens then?
hmb44e0,thentangler,11/27/2021,1,Those are still expenses.  If you are currently working in a job that is an excellent baseline to compare. You can see how much you are netting after taxes with those increased expenses.  This site has been very useful and the most accurate for me:  https://www.irscalculators.com/tax-calculator
hmbbzqv,FutureBarrySeal,11/27/2021,1,Capital gains would only be on the profit of the property. So unless I‚Äôm missing something which I‚Äôm pretty sure I am it will be a capital gains tax on $500k. Long term capital gains tax so should be around $100k on the total sale. Aka walk away with $3.9m most likely.
hm9bn2q,BirdEducational6226,11/27/2021,1,Personally Id start smoking it at 15% minimum but you may want to talk to an actual FA. Talking to a financial advisor proved to be very successful for my family because sometimes it just helps to have someone tell you where to put your money how much how often and why etc. Everybodys situation is different though.

hmaobuu,mname,11/27/2021,1, If there isn‚Äôt a clearly defined document in how and what my financial and labour and time invested into the property entails it‚Äôs just to messy.

hma4z99,DeluxeXL,11/27/2021,1,> My social security card in my wallet.   Keep your social security **card** in a safe place not on your person. Memorize that number. Its yours for life. There are official ways to give SSN to authorized persons (e.g. for a new job) without ever using that card.
hmasnlt,drownedbubble,11/27/2021,1,As other people have said you really just need to pay the balance of the statement.   But‚Ä¶.  When I got my first credit card I would make weekly payments to ensure that I didn‚Äôt overspend thinking I had extra money in my account.
hm8yw9b,atxcats,11/27/2021,14,They can actually ask when people make large withdrawals. Reasons include terrorism drugs and scams among other things.   The last one - scams - would be to make sure the person making the withdrawal isnt the victim of a scam. Sometimes scammers will approach a person (often but not always elderly) and say they are government agents investigating a bank and they have an elaborate scheme which involves the victim being asked to withdraw a large amount of money - which the scammer manages to keep. Another scam involves getting the victim to buy a large money order to send in response to a text from a relative supposedly in a bind. Guess what - there is nothing wrong with the relative and the victim just gave money to a scammer.  So its entirely possible that they werent trying to insult you but just making sure you werent sending $1000 to a relative who was supposedly in trouble.

hma1gv6,antifaction,11/27/2021,1,Look at the prime directive in this subreddits menu. You have 10K for your emergency fund you need to next max out any employee 401k funds matching (free money). Then you need to continue your plan of $1000 a month for credit cards. Pay off any debt over 4%. Next you should get your 401K contributions up to about 15% or so. After this is in place you can save for other goals contribute to non-tax advantaged accounts like an index VTSAX for example.

hm9rwka,tastygluecakes,11/27/2021,2,Seems like you should be doing the exact opposite then.  In an emergency it‚Äôs difficult to access the equity in your home.  But selling some stock in your brokerage account can be all settled up in 3 days.  If it were me I‚Äôd do post tax investing > extra principal.  You are still saving to have a safety net if you need it but going to get a better return over the long run.  The reason to put extra principal down is to not have a house payment sooner.  But consider how long it will take for that to actually impact your cash flow every month.  You might be 15-20 years away from seeing that benefit (instead of 30).    And yes there are 401k like options for self employed.  Just my two cents - you gotta do what you are comfortable with.  Good luck with business my friend!
hm9r8cy,sir_richard_head,11/27/2021,1,Ahh.  Thanks for pointing out my misunderstanding.
hm8vbu7,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,1,Lol worked in sports in 2019 as an account executive making 50k total after crushing goals and working insane hours in season (baseball). People who aren‚Äôt on the field playing or coaching don‚Äôt make the $. Then found a company that was willing to invest in my potential in tech (I manage partnerships). I probably applied to 80-100 companies networking like crazy trying to break into this industry from sports. Started off as an associate making 90k starting in Feb 2020 then got a promotion putting me at $120k in April. I also coach vball on the side so that is another $400 a month from now til May I need to plan for coming in. I‚Äôve been #blessed.

hma2f33,sytydave,11/27/2021,1,If you are buying and selling stock each of those transactions are taxable. They are most likely all short term so they would be taxable at your top (margin) tax rate. If you owned them long term the federal tax rate at your combine income level is 0%.

hma2n54,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,That sounds like a safe harbor plan where all employees get a match and the employer gets a pass from the IRS on some employer 401k rules (Id have to research to be more specific).    As for only does a match with traditional 401k do you mean the matching only goes into a traditional? Thats actually an IRS requirement no employers pay into a roth 401k. They can match your roth contributions by paying into your traditional but they cant pay into your roth.

hmahm1c,never_reddit_sober,11/27/2021,1,I hope youre taking everyones advice with a grain of salt. I will say theres probably no formula for lifestyle creep. If I were in your position I would save for the house that checks more boxes. We settled for a cheaper home to avoid the higher mortgage and a few years have gone by and not that I regret it but we definitely would have been fine upsizing for our first home. Within reason of course and what youre describing is very reasonable. The couple hundred dollars a month more you will pay for that nicer house is money well spent imo. I mean you have to live there.

hmanzs7,BouncyEgg,11/27/2021,1,Edited out errant information.  u/ricksebak is right.  No you shouldn‚Äôt have any income tax (including state) as you will pay that when you disburse the funds.  No tax on the money going in.  Yes tax on the money coming out.  This is of course assuming everything is pretax (traditional).
hm9921i,feistypenguin,11/27/2021,1,https://budgeting.thenest.com/normally-happens-lose-paycheck-23209.html  Its not unusual for paystubs to show the same pay if you worked the same number of hours each pay period. So I wouldnt read into that too much.  For whatever bank account you are depositing the checks into can you pull up your transaction history and filter out the deposits you have made? I havent had a paper paystub in a while but I believe many of them include a tally of your yearly earnings up to that point.  You should be able to do the math and see if you have an extra pay periods worth of money in there. Most major banks allow you to download your transaction history or filter it by credit (spend) or debit (receive). Also as others mentioned you can talk to the payroll department of your employer if they are big enough to have one.  Usually (not always) if a paycheck is lost then the employer will file a Stop Payment order with the bank BEFORE issuing the new check. Then if you were to actually try and deposit the check the transaction would be denied.

For one thing I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a US tax bracket where anything changes. For another thing you know that earning enough to put you ‚Äúinto the next tax bracket‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean everything that year gets taxed at that higher rate right? There‚Äôs no situation where earning another dollar means you take home LESS than you would without that dollar. It just means that dollar and the ones after that this year get taxed at the higher rate.

Im currently in the neighborhood of $2M in my retirement account. I dont hate my job so am not really in a hurry to retire unless it would be to return to consulting and be my own boss.  My liquid investments follow the market I just dump money into VTSAX when I accumulate a bit in my checking account so its currently doing way better than 3%. Thanks for your input it does feel like just carrying the mortgages is the best option for now.
hm8uwkj,HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,11/27/2021,1,Pay off the debts. Use Mycaa to get a 4K grant for school if you‚Äôre still doing that. Save 3-6 months worth of expenses and then look into investing and putting in whatever needed to get a match from your employer.
hmb3woi,cahphoenix,11/27/2021,1,They did not.  That is a common misconception.  Clearances are paid for by the government.   Here is one source but if you search you can find many more.  You cannot find sources that corroborate what you are saying.  I was also employed at a couple federal contractors before moving to startups.  &#x200B  https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs     >How much does it cost to get a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL)?        With very limited exceptions there is no direct charge to federal contractors for a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL). Government agencies receive appropriated funds to cover the cost of adjudicating security clearances and to pay an Investigation Service Provider like DCSA/NBIB for security clearance investigations. DCSA receives appropriated funds to pay for federal contractor clearance investigations and adjudications under the NISP. DCSA also receives appropriated funds to pay for security clearance adjudication for the military service departments and other DoD agencies.     Where ever you got that information it is almost certainly wrong as over 99% of all clearances are **not** paid for by the company (contractor). The company only incurs costs for maintaining the division/organization which keeps track of the clearances and clearance processes.
hmb2qv5,charleswj,11/27/2021,1,You never said that the closest you got to that was the following:  >As long as you make more than federal minimum wage for most of your working life  But fine my original comment adjusted up a dollar above federal minimum wage:  $8.25/hr works out to ~$17/yr. After federal tax and FICA thats almost $15.5k remaining or less than $1300/mo. Saving $95/mo in that scenario would **still** be next to impossible and thats not accounting for even the slightest emergency or unforseen unexpected expenses.

hma9l28,iamjerky,11/27/2021,1,Not all 401ks have a hardship provision but if you are unemployed obviously you can cash out.  I‚Äôm in favor of getting the match and cutting your expenses by the same amount.  If you haven‚Äôt done it yet - track your spending to the penny for 3 months. This will open your eyes to your true spending patterns. Having to be honest with yourself about your spending will really help you budget reflexively when you are out and about.
hmaocf4,baddad49,11/27/2021,1,oh and as others had mentioned see what you can do about that interest rate! 6% is rather high right now
hmbez4y,CabinThinker,11/27/2021,1,OP - you seem like you‚Äôre probably pretty wealthy based on the size of your investment in individual stocks. Your investing goals might differ from the average investor on this sub.   My advice to you is to try to 1) concretely identify your goals (yes of course to make more money but to what end? Is this money you need for retirement? What‚Äôs your time horizon? Is it money you‚Äôre comfortable taking a lot of risk on and potentially losing in order to make a huge short term gain?) and 2) Pick an investment strategy to match those goals.   A lot of people are going to tell you not to work with an advisor or that that they wouldn‚Äôt buy individual stocks or crypto. For example i would never do either of those things because i hate paying fees and because individual stocks are very volatile assets (and that goes double for crypto).   But the bottom line is you need to determine what you want. Do you have complicated finances that might require specialized knowledge and planning? If so maybe an advisor is worth it. Are you looking to bet the farm to make a big score? More volatile assets might be for you.   You need to determine what boat your in what you need from your portfolio and how much risk you want to take. Without knowing that people can only tell you what *they* would do with the money.
hmb9p3k,IblinkfanA,11/27/2021,1,Not to hijack OP‚Äôs thread but something here doesn‚Äôt add up when I apply this to my situation.   I‚Äôve been using the calculator at this link:  https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator  I‚Äôm 28 years old and by this time next year I plan to have roughly $50k in retirement.  Using the calculator linked assuming no more contributions and 10% interest that says I‚Äôll have $2.7m in 42 years.   However with your math if I double it 6 times (6x7=42 years + 28 years old =70) I get $3.2m.   That‚Äôs nearly half a million difference between the two calculations?
hm8yzxc,namsur1234,11/27/2021,8,I would bet this is illegal access and the bank can be fined if they dont do something about this asap. Definitely should be reported to a bank manager.
hm9qb5c,roombataxi,11/27/2021,1,Its highly unlikely you will be able to get the money back but you have to call the bank and tell them the situation.  You also need to cancel the card ASAP if you havent already. You may want to cancel any other cards you have as soon as practical just to be safe.  If you know who the friend is youll have to figure out if you want to report them to the police for theft.

hmbb3vy,cownan,11/27/2021,1,Thats a good thought but I have a bit of an attachment to the second home. It was my grandmothers that I bought from her estate when she passed away. Its in a really nice area near my extended family. I was hoping that when I do retire I might move back there. It does have quite a bit of equity though if things went bad and I needed to sell.  Im in the neighborhood of $2M in my retirement accounts which would be supplemented by a pension at my work at about $4k/mo if I retire at 65. It seems like that would be enough plus whatever growth in those accounts between now and when I retire
hma0jni,boolda,11/27/2021,1,1. No. The prediction tools are not accurate. Use a tool like portfolio visualizer to do a montecarlo simulation using your portfolio. This will give a range of value. You generally can expect to hit the median.  2.  You did not say who is your employer. The differed compensation plant is generally 457. If your employer is a state or federal government the account operates exactly like 401k with an option to take out the money if you leave your employer without any penalty.  About your child take an education loan below 4-5%. Pay only the interest. When you retire with 1.5M or so take the money out of your 457 and payoff the loan. Don‚Äôt worry about college expenses now.   In general at your age contribute as much pretax money as you can the. Fund a Roth IRA if you have left over money then save in brokerage account.   Don‚Äôt use target date funds don‚Äôt use bonds. Put everything you have in a SNP 500 or total market fund. In your case the fund selection will make or break your retirement. With proper fund selection you can surely have 1M or more at 65.
hma0z3b,HemingwayHuxley,11/27/2021,1,My recommendation? Go to college. Take it out in loans. If you want to enlist the Army will pay them if you enlist with a Bachelors and GI Bill resets at three years so you will likely get out with 36 months and can use it for masters or kids.  If this is not a possibility then get your degree while in using Tuition Assistance and your GI bill after the fact can still be used for masters or kids. Online classes while active duty are ROUGH though. 5yr Active Duty Army SGT 3 yr active reserve.

hma1efb,Chess01,11/27/2021,1,These guys were most likely just after your money that‚Äôs all.  The biggest risk is then selling your personal information.  It‚Äôs one of the oldest scams in the book.

hm967j7,TuesdayGamby,11/27/2021,2,Earn more money. Get a better job work more at your current job get a second job. Focusing on your expenditures can help but bringing in more money will help more. I dont see utilities or insurance on your list you may be spending more than you listed.  Spending more money on a car does not equal a better car. Spend the time you are saving to find a great deal on a GOOD car. Tell everyone you are looking for a reliable used car and someone will know a grandma that cant drive anymore or someone that would rather help you out with a private sale of a good car rather than trading it in. Patience in buying a car will save you money. Use this time to learn to identify a junk car vs a good car. Getting a car from someone you know will likely be better and cheaper than a random car from a dealer.

hmb1i78,tony_boxacannoli,11/27/2021,1,Not knowing where you are located...I cant offer much on the time-line - but lets assume it is correct as your lease actually ends on February 7 well beyond 60 days.   Your options are to accept new terms or refuse new terms.   You could try and negotiate better terms...how were you as a tenant? On time every month? Report any maintenance issues before they became a problem? etc. These factors a LL might consider.  If you decide to refuse the terms you have 2 options: move...dont move.   You have a lot of time from now until Feb. 7 to find a place if you opt to not accept new terms and move.   If you decide to not accept new lease terms AND not move...depending on your State...things could get very complicated and expensive.
hmatq3c,Getmybaby,11/27/2021,1,Switch banks. Its not their business why you need your own money.  If they are small and only local they likely dont have enough cash kept on hand to meet reserve minimums or only keep just enough to stay legal.  I would notify your state banking regulator.

Another option maybe Uber or Lyft to make up the difference while recovering no heavy lifting needed. Maybe one of those delivery food services but Im not sure how much heavy lifting those would be.

hm8zylp,Adept-One-666,11/27/2021,42,What about Martha Stewart? She was worth $400 million and went to jail for $500k. Still boggles my mind.
hm9trrs,nirachi,11/27/2021,1,My parents have already set up a trust directly with a bank. I will inquire if this was done.
hmb4rvl,Papicloses,11/27/2021,1,I think often times we are all skewed to thinking that 20% down is the only way to go. FHA you can put 3.5% down or Conventional you can go 3% or 5% minimum down to get into a home. We are seeing clients wanting to get into homes to build wealth by using the minimum down payment requirements and then refinancing down the road to take off PMI to make additional wealth moves.
hm9vk8l,briinde,11/27/2021,1,Normally the return on paying down the mortgage isn‚Äôt worth it mathematically. But it can be from a peace of mind standpoint.  But in your case if you do this and can get rid of PMI faster the return is even greater. What‚Äôs the house worth and how much do you owe? How much principal gets taken off each month?
hm9xhx5,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,1,Offer for them to look into Mint Mobile or something. Its a fairly reasonable plan and my wife hasn‚Äôt had any issues with it. Compared to my att bill its much less.  Plus he now has a small bill of his own to maintain and be responsible for.
hmacw4n,oneshot99210,11/27/2021,1,The payoff for pre-paying on the mortgage is only 3% (or whatever your interest rate is).    The stock market has payed over 20% this year has averaged over 15% for a long time and has historically averaged 10% annually over any 30 year period.   Another way to look at it is the fastest way to get to $0 mortgage is to invest until the investment total is equal/higher than the mortgage balance.
hm8yxv9,Tantric989,11/27/2021,18,Thats my first thought.  There are basically three groups on Earth who know how much money I make my boss HR and my bank all of whom I expect to keep that information to themselves.
hmb477z,lippoper,11/27/2021,1,There are other platforms like Coinbase Voyager Kraken etc‚Ä¶ offering insane APRs on stable coins as well.
hma6q2j,king_of_not_a_thing,11/27/2021,1,I recommend using the retirement and 529 calculators on Bankrate to get an idea of where you‚Äôre at and where you‚Äôll be at different savings rates and just adjust accordingly! And good luck with baby! We‚Äôre three months in and enjoying every minute. The biggest expense is going to be daycare. We started ‚Äúpaying for daycare‚Äù (I.e. setting aside the cost) before little one was born and ended up with a nice nest egg by the time he arrived.
hmarb9d,rwhal06,11/27/2021,1,I updated my post above to say I REFUSE to share my Vanguard credentials with a 3rd party like Mint or Plaid or PersonalCapital I care about security.   Thats why Im interested in federated logins or read-only credentials or API keys.   The bot sent me to https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing which has a section called Why does everyone seem to recommend Vanguard? which is what I was afraid of. It sounds like there is a serious trade-off between low-fees and having decent reporting and technology.
hma7pol,TK_TK_,11/27/2021,1,How old are you both and how much do you have in retirement? You don‚Äôt ‚Äúmax‚Äù a 401(k) until you put $19500/year in it ($20500) next year. So you‚Äôre only putting in the minimum to get the company match? With the matches what % of $105k are you saving? What % of $135k?   Don‚Äôt buy a house you can only afford if you aren‚Äôt adequately saving for retirement.
hm9jnb2,usjosh,11/27/2021,1,Thank you all for your responses. I read through every one and have decided to leave things where they are for now. Thank you!
hmainuh,ResultNo3300,11/27/2021,1,Yes I checked my Citibank account and found a secondary phone number under my profile. I called Citibank why there was an unknown number under my profile. Then Citibank deleted. Totally I lost $11300. I am going to file CFPB complaint to Citibank and PayPal too.
hmb3udu,Redcorns,11/27/2021,1,Call your local land trust (Northeast Wisconsin Land Trust is one) and talk to them about donating it. They‚Äôll cover all the legal fees etc and you‚Äôll get a tax deduction in the year the deal closes which will probably be tax year 2022 at this point.
hm8ujei,ELPwork,11/27/2021,6,> the teller **IS** doing it to other customers too.  FIFY
hmayj4s,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,1,You should simply do the taxes both ways and compare. Certain software helps do this quickly.  I dont think Ive ever seen a real life situation where filing separate was better. Ive seen people do it (eg divorces) but only the IRS wins.
hmb9vvy,Eldi_Bee,11/27/2021,1,Yeah. I did the P2P loans before too. It shocked people when I showed them the money I was getting from the risky borrowers.  And it was always the good people on the lowest interest who ended up defaulting after making like no payment.
hmadpnp,digitalhelix84,11/27/2021,1,The money is physically moved a few times daily but the largest banks all operate pretty seamlessly and most people can easily transfer instantly.  Faster Payments and Osko are effectively the same as Zelle with the same solutions for smaller institutions.  The US also has several alternatives like Venmo or PayPal which can use the card payment networks for instant transfer.  Some people prefer the anonymity of that since you can set up an email just for your PayPal and Venmo rather than giving strangers your phone number or other similar identifying info.
hmbkkxv,pownedju,11/27/2021,1,Good advice. I need to look more into the cost of online grad school. In my area I think 50-60k is likely what I‚Äôd be making as a clinical therapist just starting out.
hma3w4u,DeluxeXL,11/27/2021,1,Learn what you invested. A target date fund invests in almost all kinds of public stocks and bonds on the whole planet. If it goes down and doesnt come back up ever the whole planet is fd. Russell 1000 invests in 92% of the US public stocks so you are also investing in a strong economical power. They will go up in the long run which coincides with your own time frame (401k is for retirement 30-40 years away). Short term price fluctuations are normal.  If you are talking about your 401k dropping 3% when you are 61 yea you should probably review your portfolio.
hm9u320,ASHAKANTASHARMA,11/27/2021,1,I cant help you in any way but just wanted to wish Gods blessings for you üôèüôèüôè
hmb94pf,Rubily00,11/27/2021,1,Also scores fluctuate naturally over time. The heuristics used to pull the number are sloppy and weird and a +-20 swing is about the natural range with no major changes. Try not to stress too much about it.  Lenders often dont care about the specific number at all and instead will be looking at *specific factors* they favor. Some lenders may not care at all about thin files but care a lot about DTI ratio. Others dont care a ton about your income but want to see a long history of payments. Each will calculate their own type of score with different criteria. Focus on building good habits and dont stress so much about this.
hmb4kl7,zerogee616,11/27/2021,1,That makes more sense. If you had to cut any of those Id hold off on the HSA and 401k.
hmb3fuh,hoodytwin,11/27/2021,1,Contact DU to see if they‚Äôd be interested in leasing it. Would be perfect for nesting boxes
hmandfp,Dirtylicious,11/27/2021,1,It shows financial strength of the buyer. In todays competitive market sellers are often receiving multiple offers.   The buying process is a negotiation. A 5% down offer can be interpreted that the buyer does not have enough capital to make up the difference if there is an appraisal gap. Or is there is a lengthy inspection report with multi issues they may want excess compensation.
hm8v6ht,Ok-Grapefruit-1072,11/27/2021,1,Also I already live off a spreadsheet since I was 16.
hmav2l7,DonaldKey,11/27/2021,1,I ran into this issue recently. Withdrawing $4k. They said it‚Äôs because they only keep so much money in the branch at a time and I would be taking a big chunk of it so they couldn‚Äôt give smaller amounts to other people.   They were nice but asked that if I wanted a larger withdrawal to ask them so they could order more money for me.
hm8vzno,ZenGuruji,11/27/2021,2,If your ultimate goal is only 1M excluding retirement then why take on these rental properties?  If you are both living off of your husbands income (60k) putting your 120k into savings/investments then cant you achieve 1M via an ETF or mutual fund in 7-8 years? Even if you put 20k into savings per year (until you reach 1 year COL) and put the remaining 100k into ETFs/mutual funds you will still reach this goal excluding retirement.  You could then use a percentage of that for passive income from the market instead of all the headaches that come from rentals.
hmaglqs,ArtLife8246,11/27/2021,1,Find out who the adjacent property owners are and see if they have an interest. You can find the property owners by looking at a platt book or call the county recorder‚Äôs office.
hm8x07k,Coco_chaniel,11/27/2021,1,Short term is 10 years time $1M. 2 kids in. A house in the county almost paid off from cashing out on our Austin properties in SC and FU money all wrapped into one! So we would need investments to get there as placing money into regular savings wouldn‚Äôt grow at the rate we need. Like I‚Äôm saying I want to pause working for a while and travel with my husband and kids for the entire summer (since he‚Äôs a teacher and loves this job) in Asia and not freak out. I‚Äôd still work but on my own terms.   I‚Äôm still trying to understand navigating those short term goals (10 years) vs long term (30-40 years) and correctly and responsibly allocating money and the same attention towards both those goals since I‚Äôm only 29. I think I‚Äôd have a better understanding of goal setting for FI and later retirement if I was only 10 or 15 years from your standard retirement age instead of 31.
hmagyju,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1,Lets say in retirement you need $80k/yr net income.  If you use Roth only all of your contributions now are taxed at 12% (because your marginal bracket is 12%). In retirement you take out $80k - its all untaxed which is great because you effectively already paid 12% on the entire thing. Which means you paid $9600 in tax to get a net income of $80000 = 12% effective tax (9600 / 80000).  If instead you use Traditional for the entire thing all your contributions now are taxed at 0%. In retirement you take out $87k because youre going to owe some tax. Your first $25900 is $0 in tax (standard deduction) your next $20550 is $2055 in tax (10%). Your next $40550 is $4866 in tax (12%). Your total tax paid = $6921 giving you a net income of $80079 = 7.955% effective tax (6921 / 87000).    So with a retirement income of $80k net if you paid into Roth only from the 12% bracket your total tax paid = 12%...if instead you paid into Traditional only and deferred tax your total tax paid = 7.955% for a similar net income.    As for why max out the Roth IRA at all now it gives you flexibility. If your retirement income is $150k later because you did really well the 12% you paid for the Roth will be better than paying 22% on the dollars in the 22% bracket. ($83k to $178k). It can also shelter you from higher taxes if tax laws change by the time you retire assuming they dont change Roth tax laws by then. Plus its pretty easy to hit the $6k limit and then put any additional back into traditional 401k anyway.    EDIT: Additionally with a Roth IRA you can take contributions out early without penalty so you could use that to help you retire earlier than 59.5 if you wanted to...which you cant do with traditional (you would pay tax *plus* a 10% penalty).
hmaufvy,LanLantheKandiMan,11/27/2021,1,If you already purchased the car you cant do anything.   If you are looking to purchase then get a price from them( have them print the paper showing final cost out the door)  take that to several other dealers with similar models and see if they are willing to compete on price.  If you get a lower offer take that quote back to original dealer and see if they want to compete.     Also you shouldnt be paying taxes on a car for 2 states.  Even if you buy from 1 and ship to another the taxes should only be for the state the car is titled in
hmamtjs,Careful_Height4146,11/27/2021,1,Youre pretty confident for someone who has no idea what theyre talking about.

hma2b2i,kiwishark79,11/27/2021,1,No because I dont live in the same county as the university that I attend.
hmbb7qm,Supersnoop25,11/27/2021,1,The bonds are garenteed money. You probably should max the 30k. If you wanted a garenteed %100 safe %2.44 return just pay off a good chunk of your debt. Other than that probably just max your roth and throw whats left into index funds obviously keeping a good chunk for an emergency.
hmay3nm,Ray_725,11/27/2021,1,Thank you and I greatly appreciate your response!
hmbt2au,MangeLeBebe,11/27/2021,1,BMW does not currently allow 3rd party buyouts on their leased vehicles. Many captive lenders started disallowing this earlier in the year to help their manufacturers maintain revenue streams while their new car inventory dried up.  This means you cant just sell the car or trade it in like you can do with a traditionally financed vehicle.
