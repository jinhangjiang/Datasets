hmeypt9,N/A,1hotjava,11/28/2021,1, >($1 = £.75). My Citibank credit card charged me $  > ($1 = £.718).  Exchange rate changes daily. A 3.2 pence swing is totally possible between when you placed the order and when the transaction cleared a few days later.
hmey5mc,hmeygge,JakeParry34,11/28/2021,1,About 30k combined in savings w/ ability to add roughly 3-4K per month to that. Wouldn’t be moving into the house for 5-6 months so plenty of time to do reno
hmexgzz,hmeyed0,ark_mod,11/28/2021,1,Dont listen to this guy - garbage advice.  I have never heard of anyone purchasing a property without first seeing inside. Your basically saying just trust what the bank wants.  Without an inspection or even a walk through you dont know if your getting a property with a crumbling foundation water damage mould etc.   You dont just buy foreclosures at face value. You figure out first if your getting into a knock down rebuild or light refurbishing. Its the difference between a few thousand and a few hundred thousand.
hmexclo,,trevor32192,11/28/2021,1,The foundation issue is that the house from late 1800s to early 1900s settled. Its really a cosmetic problem the house isnt going to fall down. I bought the house last year. I could pay 60k to have the foundation lifted to level the house but its not a necessity nor is it dangerous. That was also a single quote from one company and there are other ways to fix the sloped floors outside of raising the whole foundation.
hmex3jg,hmexgzz,interstat,11/28/2021,1,We call that a short sale. Which is pre forclosure  Foreclosures you are luckily if you even get to see the inside of the house. Definitely not a inspection  In my area we dont have foreclosures through a realtor company which would be only way to get inspection and see inside.  We do it through sheriff auctions you bid and you own it
hmewynd,hmexryw,UMfan11244,11/28/2021,1,Would recommend Schwab or Fidelity to open.
hmewr1l,hmewynd,pooyasnoo,11/28/2021,1,Oh okay. That makes sense. I apologize.
hmewq5l,hmex6k3,pooyasnoo,11/28/2021,1,Gotcha. I didnt know that Roth IRA arent. Okay now its making more sense. Ill look into that.
hmewlfk,hmexsq8,krustymeathead,11/28/2021,1,it would still be one loan but with two applicants. like a joint account. then both are fully responsible for making payments if the other cant.
hmewe9r,hmewlfk,PdSales,11/28/2021,1,What if they used the same lender?
hmewa6p,hmewqc8,RobertTheBloke1,11/28/2021,1,Yes - they told me not to worry as the card used wasn’t mine but weren’t able to give a real reason why my email was used.  2 Factor via device set up as well on gmail.
hmew8ep,hmewv1o,aflawinlogic,11/28/2021,1,Yes its a municipal corporation not a private enterprise.  Yeah every utility seems to have its own nuance.
hmevyee,hmeym4h,MarcableFluke,11/28/2021,1,>Here’s how my state handles it.  Your state has no specific overtime laws so employers are beholden only to the federal laws governing overtime.  >South Carolina does not have any state-specific labor laws or overtime statutes  Which again means overtime is paid on hours worked over 40 per work week. Pay period is irrelevant.  >Not every hourly worker is entitled to overtime.  Yes exempt employees are not eligible for overtime but there are a lot of provisions on who can be exempt.
hmevn5s,hmewqb6,Ameteur_Professional,11/28/2021,1,No because getting bumped into a bracket doesnt make a huge difference.  Tax rates are marginal.  Youre taxes X% on your first $YYYYY of earnings then Z% on your next $WWWWW of earnings etc.  So even if the top marginal tax rate is the same less money will be taxes at that rate.
hmevn5s,hmez2s8,OathOfFeanor,11/28/2021,1,Thanks that is what I was missing in my mental math.  With that factored in I ran a sample and the numbers still come out in favor of filing jointly even if what I described were to happen
hmeviuw,hmexz9f,JoeClackin,11/28/2021,1,Looks like PNC is offering some checking account promotions so you can earn some easy money while you try them out. Definitely keep the Chase account open until you are sure.
hmevg4r,hmewa6p,DeluxeXL,11/28/2021,1,Did you already tell Nike everything you told us here?  Also make sure your Google has two factor using TOTP (authenticator) not the SMS kind.
hmev79k,hmevg4r,RobertTheBloke1,11/28/2021,1,What can I do? Obviously comply and help should it ever come back to me - but is there anything proactive I can do?
hmev1ii,hmev9z3,Its-a-write-off,11/28/2021,1,Can you link the comments that said its based on sale price alone? All the ones I see are asking about depreciation or basis.
hmeut8a,hmew1o8,wanttostayhidden,11/28/2021,1,Contributions to a traditional IRA are not always tax deductible. There are income limits if you are covered by a workplace plan.
hmeuk4g,hmeybyk,HorizontalBob,11/28/2021,1,Only if you have a workplace retirement account
hmeugqm,hmev1ii,ronald_mcdonald_4prz,11/28/2021,1,Right. But that’s still based on a difference between two prices. Not the entirety of the sales price or purchase price.
hmeu4d3,hmevfs2,na3than,11/28/2021,1,Also 15 states require lenders to pay interest on escrow accounts: Alaska California Connecticut Iowa Maine Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota New Hampshire New York Oregon Rhode Island Utah Vermont and Wisconsin (source: https://www.frameworkhomeownership.org/blog/the-10-most-common-escrow-questions). In those states youre actually earning a few dollars in interest on your escrowed property tax payments.

hmetjxs,hmeuhbt,hopingtothrive,11/28/2021,1,I understand OPs situation perfectly. Scammers find easy targets. The scam of sending money and then asking for it back is one of the oldest and most common scams but seems to work.
hmet7gz,hmevn5s,OathOfFeanor,11/28/2021,1,But really neither of those is guaranteed to happen right?  Without an evaluation wont you risk bumping the low earner into a higher bracket and changing nothing for the high earner?
hmet7gz,hmez86y,OathOfFeanor,11/28/2021,1,Thanks yep you are 100% right that was the missing factor I had not accounted for.
hmes7ka,hmetsbq,GenericPanda7,11/28/2021,1,Awesome thank you!
hmes5ju,hmet9z8,DeluxeXL,11/28/2021,1,Read the [Prime Directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). Looks like you skipped some steps.
hmerxjn,hmes5ju,Jabrichmond,11/28/2021,1,I am a little familiar with them but I haven’t given them a long look yet
hmerv4j,hmes7ka,HonestParadox,11/28/2021,1,I looked at the 1 year charts (jan to dec) going back several years and tried to see what month was likely the lowest to purchase.  It was consistently Jan.
hmerup6,hmeryid,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,1,Thanks so much!
hmerua3,hmet7gz,doktorhladnjak,11/28/2021,1,Income tax rates in the US are progressive. Dropping the high earner into a lower bracket almost always saves more than bumping the low earner into a higher bracket costs.
hmerua3,hmez5rw,hodl3232,11/28/2021,1,Since tax brackets are marginal both A and B result in the same total tax amount every time. The only reason to file separately is to get special deductions that get phased out at higher salaries.  For example my wife and I did not qualify for the covid relief payments last year when filing jointly but my wife was able to get them when we filed our taxes separately.
hmerqps,hmerup6,Ritchie_not_Richie,11/28/2021,1,Keep up the good work! 😊
hmerq6q,hmes44h,PM_ME_GLUTE_SPREAD,11/28/2021,1,Yesin therms of maximizing efficiency in the gym and getting the most for your time b/s/d are best. But when looking to save a few bucks on a gym membership when you aren’t even sure what you want out of a gym b/s/d is completely unnecessary.   >This is why you don’t ask for gym advice on personalfinance.   They didn’t ask for gym advice they asked for financial advice.
hmerost,hmey9kl,CurryMustard,11/28/2021,1,Zillow was driving prices up like crazy so thats probably why the market has softened a bit since they stopped buying. Historically prices always dip in the winter anyway. Nothing wrong with 5% down youre still building equity that you wouldnt build by renting. In order for the market to really soften there would have to be a large increase in supply or a large decrease in demand I dont really see that happening anytime soon.
hmerivp,hmerv4j,GenericPanda7,11/28/2021,1,Out of what sample size if you dont mind me asking.
hmer255,hmerqps,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,1,Thats exactly what I do I guess I just use the due date as my reference point to pay down before statement since my payments are on autopay.  Before 2021 I has no idea I was using my cc incorrectly I have seen the light and Im never going back
hmeqwu3,hmevg9e,sasafracas,11/28/2021,1,This is actually exactly why Im asking the question.  Im using credit scores as a comparison to the 100 pt grading system in schools.  Im trying to get faculty to use a 50 - 100 system since 50% is still failing.  Do we really have to tell students that they not only failed but failed at a spectacular rate of 23%?  Its just weird - and mathematically inaccurate - but thats a longer response than needed in a subreddit on finance :)
hmeqv6j,hmes2n0,xxshteviexx,11/28/2021,1,That would be my vote. Or look to cut other budget items like fast food if applicable.
hmeqv6j,hmev5qb,MarcableFluke,11/28/2021,1,>It was an intentional decision   Well yeah I havent heard of many accidental car purchases. The fact that it was intentional doesnt make it any less of a poor financial decision.
hmeqo9f,hmerhhy,alan_grant93,11/28/2021,1,If you bought a car how much money do you have for:  1) Monthly payment 2) Gas 3) Insurance 4) Maintenance  For us gas insurance and maintenance has been about 50% of the car payment. Our previous $300/mo car payment required about $200 for gas/maintenance/insurance and our current $600/mo car payment requires about $300/mo for those things.
hmeqnbz,hmer255,Ritchie_not_Richie,11/28/2021,1,Ok. So you do exactly what you’re supposed to do but for some reason your original comment reads backwards to me.   What I always tell my clients is put all your spend on your card. Pay it down to 10% before the statement closing date. Then set it to autopay that 10% on the due date.   When your comment was putting the due date before the following closing date I was trying to figure out if you were mixing up the terms or something.   Thanks for clarifying because I was honestly worried you were messing up your credit there for a minute lol.
hmeqdw6,hmeqo9f,Zahhhreemo,11/28/2021,1,Sturdiest comment on here OG 🤞🏿 & yeah like 1500 for now. I’m climbing
hmeqdsn,hmey4tt,BitterJim,11/28/2021,1,That isnt how tax brackets work. You dont pay the max % on all the money you made you pay one percentage on the first $x then another percentage on the next $y and so on. Being in a higher tax bracket doesnt matter because being married means you have more money that is taxed at the lower rates.
hmeqdsn,hmerua3,OathOfFeanor,11/28/2021,1,> Married couples also have the option to file separately in situation where that is advantageous.  Thats the thing it seems to me that this calculation should be performed each year.  Scenario A - Averaging them together drops the higher salary into a lower bracket (worth filing jointly)  Scenario B - Averaging them together raises the lower salary into a higher bracket (better to file separately)?  What makes scenario A any more likely than Scenario B?
hmeqdsn,hmey577,doktorhladnjak,11/28/2021,1,No but the married brackets are exactly 2x the single brackets for the same rate until you get to the top bracket of 37%. That only comes into effect once combined you are making more than $628k per year.   There is an impact to deductions well below that usually around student loan interest if one spouse is a modest earner and in somewhat higher income households around state and local tax deductions (SALT) or mortgage interest deductions (once a mortgage is more than $750k).
hmeq6h6,hmer44p,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,1,Yes this is correct. I did not clarify well
hmeq6h6,hmeqaws,Ritchie_not_Richie,11/28/2021,1,That’s what I was thinking but they clarified and confirmed they pay after the due date. 🤷‍♂️
hmeq1ck,hmevo87,sasafracas,11/28/2021,1,Or they could set the range from 73 - 284 and really mess with people
hmeq1bm,hmeqnbz,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,1,Yes no problem sorry if its confusing!  Ill pay my statement balance in full from previous month. For the new statement because I pay 90% of my purchases using my cc I will have a high utilization so I pay it down after due date and right before statement period ends  Example: 23rd -Pay off $300 from October statement  6th- Total balance of $1000 pay down to $300 7th (statement period end) -$300 reported
hmeppxm,hmeq1bm,Ritchie_not_Richie,11/28/2021,2,I feel like I’m missing something here. If you pay after the due date you’re making a late payment. And the statement date is typically 23 - 28 days-ish before the due date.   Can you elaborate on your strategy for me so I can understand what you’re doing?
hmepned,hmeq7uv,Motobugs,11/28/2021,1,Just dont be over the limit and no late payments. I honestly dont know what those guys talking about.
