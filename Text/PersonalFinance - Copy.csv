t3_rbh7vr,hnocrar,,What is best for me Roth 401k or regular 401k,ClassroomFamous8200,12/7/2021,1.0,Thats kinda what I was thinking too. It really seemed close. I might just switch to traditional for the current tax savings I can get.
t3_rbh7vr,hnod3ch,,What is best for me Roth 401k or regular 401k,ClassroomFamous8200,12/7/2021,1.0,I am currently engaged and getting married next fall so I would plan on being married in retirement. I am currently 25 and have been at my company for 6 years. I am definitely in a better position than many. I appreciate the reply.
t3_rbh7u9,hnocmta,,Am i crazy for maxing my Roth 401K and Roth IRA at 25?,Hoppy1952,12/7/2021,1.0,Having worked for 30+ years for a retirement/financial services company I can attest that most clients were worried that they were going to outlive their retirement savings. So maximizing your retirement savings is not a bad decision. Especially if you family members tend to live long lives and you are in good health.
t3_rbgtp3,hnocddi,,Auto Purchasing: Pre-inspection & Delivery Fee on Used Car.,duensuels,12/7/2021,1.0,Because I was looking for a very specific combination of vehicle/year/price etc and the search will return whatever it returns and I go to whichever dealership has it in stock.  It just happened that the last three were small dealerships this one was a big dealership.    Having said that though someone gave me a good idea to maybe notify those previous small dealerships what Im looking for and maybe when they go to auctions or talk to their buyers they could perhaps put in a buy request of this specific vehicle type and let me know they have one they can acquire and sell to me.
t3_rbgtp3,hnobhd6,,Auto Purchasing: Pre-inspection & Delivery Fee on Used Car.,t-poke,12/7/2021,1.0,I mean…you can Google it but Nissan’s CVTs have a history of issues. I believe there have been lawsuits over it.
t3_rbgtp3,hnobkxu,,Auto Purchasing: Pre-inspection & Delivery Fee on Used Car.,duensuels,12/7/2021,1.0,Yup was my thought exactly which is why I adamantly refused to sign anything further and get outta there poste haste.
t3_rbgtp3,hnoblj0,,Auto Purchasing: Pre-inspection & Delivery Fee on Used Car.,Joy_McClure,12/7/2021,1.0,I understand. I’m more curious on why you didn’t go back to your usual spots you had success with?   PDI can come off. It’s a little extra money for management
t3_rbfs5a,hnocvro,,Advice on catching up on retirement,maedocc,12/7/2021,1.0,>12k in IRAs between my wife and I   You can also put $6k into your wifes IRA so its really: $12k IRA (split between two IRAs) and $14k in employers Simple IRA. Total $26k -- after that if your wife doesnt have any workplace retirement options then taxable brokerage.
t3_rba2ro,hnoczco,,What to do with $50K Windfall,BigBodySS,12/7/2021,1.0,Thats great to hear thank you so much for clarifying that for me
t3_rba2ro,hnocugw,,What to do with $50K Windfall,xaradevir,12/7/2021,1.0,Jeff Bezos could write you a check for $5 billion and it would have zero tax implications for YOU.  $15k per person-to-person gift is a threshold for the person gifting the money to report the amount over $15k to the IRS with their tax filing. The recipient has nothing to report.  The amount above that threshold reduces the gifted lifetime exclusion amount which is over $11 million. the gifter has zero tax consequences until that is exceeded. Once the lifetime exemption is reached further gifts in excess of the annual exclusion result in taxes owed by the gifter.  As recipient you dont have anything to worry about receiving cash gifts.
rbuu5y,hnqf683,hnqfexr,Savings in Comparison,Reading-Financial,12/08/2021,1.0,Biweekly sounds like a healthy way to go about it. The daily obsessiveness is becoming to much for me. Everything is a +/- .. even if its food that I need to live.
rbuu5y,hnqf0zj,hnqf7ee,Savings in Comparison,Reading-Financial,12/08/2021,1.0,I do not use a budget I dont think Ive ever actually sat down and written out a budget. Ive only ever sat down and written my monthly expenses so I know what the number is.
rbut31,hnqeg7v,hnqf3ni,Calculating a year end bonus at 30%,grahamfiend2,12/08/2021,1.0,Ask HR. But if that’s the exact language I would guess it’s a $2400 bonus.
rbut31,hnqebb1,hnqfaj1,Calculating a year end bonus at 30%,grahamfiend2,12/08/2021,1.0,Even better when you realize they may actually make $130k :-)  Really though don’t read too much into it. OP may earn their salary in a field that doesn’t require math but requires other skills that justify the pay.
rbut31,hnqebb1,hnqf2zj,Calculating a year end bonus at 30%,BabooTibia,12/08/2021,1.0,I know of people that make millions a year that have terrible reading writing and basic math skills.
rbus9r,hnqfgyw,hnqfuyo,Question on RSU Vesting,gaff2049,12/08/2021,1.0,Thanks. First time dealing with RSUs. Was dealing with options and time based triggers for distributions for the last decade. That ended last year and now have RSUs with my new company.
rbun12,hnqeeu6,hnqflaz,Question on trading a vehicle you have equity in,Werewolfdad,12/08/2021,1.0,> I figured on leasing and taking the equity if I could find the right deal on a lease  A large down payment on a lease is imprudent and a lease is the most expensive way to own a car.  >Im just trying to find a way to take advantage of the equity if I can!  The only way to do so is to sell the car *and not buy another one* (or significantly downgrade)
rbun12,hnqedrf,hnqev5v,Question on trading a vehicle you have equity in,JirenxMuzaka,12/08/2021,1.0,My current loan is 0% APR. I was planning on going to something cheaper as my current car payment is 400 and I see decent base model cars for around 200 on leases. I was just trying to get an idea of if it was worth the time to attempt to cash in on my car being worth just as much/more than when I bought it two years ago
rbs8t7,hnqer7e,hnqfjgw,"30 - Giving up on chasing high earning dreams, just want something 80k+ that's 40 hours a week max.",Jesus_Was_Brown,12/08/2021,1.0,I have an interview with Amazon coming up... and this concerns me too. Sure I can do $300k but my life is gone for 2 years.
rbs8t7,hnqek18,hnqewlj,"30 - Giving up on chasing high earning dreams, just want something 80k+ that's 40 hours a week max.",JohnBoy11BB,12/08/2021,1.0,Currently Im a Banker. How do I get into finance? Sorry for the questions i just changed my career path and need some guidance.
rbs8t7,hnqeg71,hnqetfp,"30 - Giving up on chasing high earning dreams, just want something 80k+ that's 40 hours a week max.",Jesus_Was_Brown,12/08/2021,1.0,Lol for real. Thanks for the support. This thread has turned me day around
rbi8pt,hnohgza,,Moving 401K- website to help me “copy” my funds?,ZookyTheClown,12/7/2021,1.0,Fidelity going to T Rowe Price. This money was with an old employer and I need to move it from there.
rbhkre,hnofo89,,Where do I buy health insurance while I'm waiting for my benefits to kick in with my new job?,CourtM092,12/7/2021,1.0,Yes I previously had Horizion BCBS through my last employer
rbh7u9,hnogsd3,,Am i crazy for maxing my Roth 401K and Roth IRA at 25?,Huge-Capital-2852,12/7/2021,1.0,Okay but this ignores the investments earnings which is the root of the decision on my end
rbh7u9,hnoh7pt,,Am i crazy for maxing my Roth 401K and Roth IRA at 25?,Huge-Capital-2852,12/7/2021,1.0,Yeah that makes sense. I always figured my investment would compound over 40 years and those earnings off the principle would negate any taxes paid up front.
rbh7u9,hnoho0j,,Am i crazy for maxing my Roth 401K and Roth IRA at 25?,taurusfeeling,12/7/2021,1.0,Is a good way for OP to hedge against the wrong decision (I.e. guessing tax rates across board will be higher in the future) splitting contributions into both?
rbh30u,hnoh2x3,,ROTH IRA Explanation as a trader,apollosmith,12/7/2021,1.0,Yes mostly. If you sell for a loss in taxable and purchase the same security in the IRA 30 days before OR after that sell then youll trigger an IRA wash sale and the loss will be permanently disallowed in the taxable account. Having capital losses disappear so they cant offset any gains can have massive tax implications.
rbh30u,hnogk27,,ROTH IRA Explanation as a trader,DeadFIL,12/7/2021,1.0,The only advice you are likely to get from this sub is that you should invest in ETFs or mutual funds consisting of stocks spanning the majority of the market like S&P500 or total market funds (as well as a mix of some international funds) because they outperform any known strategy over long time periods (and long time periods is what you should be considering for a retirement fund). Unless you have knowledge that isnt publicly available and which you strongly believe will lead to price changes unpredictable to other investors the S&P 500 will outperform your strategy in the long term.
rb8tvp,hnoh6kx,,Auto loans: 36-month at 0% APR or 60-month at 1.49% APR,xaradevir,12/7/2021,1.0,The ending balance on each row is the sum of the starting balance plus monthly interest and the monthly contribution.
,hno90y4,,ObviousFoxx,12/7/2021,1,,Yeah I know there will still be a payment but that VR should decrease that.
