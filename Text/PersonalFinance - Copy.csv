Ok follow up question if you dont mind. The 0.50% offer is tiered and when a certain number is passed it goes to 0.15% interest monthly. Would it be better to make sure that number isnt passed?

Other than the 1929 crash no other crash has gone down more than 25%. The S&P averages about a 15% return every year. If you keep it in there for five years you’ll get a 75% return. If a “crash” happens you’re still up 50%. It’s basic simple math yet people think “crashes” are the end of the world.

r3r2u7,r3r2u7,401k from a former employer; IRA questions,hunt4245,11/27/2021,2.0,Ive found a lot of posts and discussions about this topic but nothing that directly answered my questions so...  I am 24 and transitioning into a different career path. I have an Ameritas 401k from my previous employer with a balance of 9k.  I start my new job on Monday but somewhat unfortunately they do not offer a company 401k. This led me to look into what I need to do with my old account.  I am trying to figure out if I should open a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA to roll the money into. Or open another account and leave the 401k alone?  I was wanting a Roth IRA if for no other other reason than its what Ive always been told is the best (moreso even then a 401k unless theres a company match). However I understand that if you roll into a Roth I would liable for the tax on the balance (9k). I was thinking this might almost be a good thing though because I should be in a higher tax bracket next year with my new job (previous employer I made mid-30k a year should be increasing to 50k-60 next year)? If I go this route Im assuming that the total balance is transferred and I am liable for the tax out-of-pocket right?  I suppose that another question I have is what really is the benefit of a Roth over a standard IRA? All I know of is that the Roth being post-tax is a benefit if you will be in a higher tax bracket later in life. If Im not sure that this will be the case (I think the jump in pay Im making now will probably be the biggest Ill have in my career but I suppose you never know) is there any downside to a standard IRA?

r3rlme,hmcc10g,"Percent of savings to invest, put in savings account, etc",metalguysilver,11/27/2021,11.0,Once you have 6-12 months of expenses in savings I wouldn’t put any more in savings unless you’re saving for specific thing (vacation car…). Put a minimum of 15% into retirement more if you can and invest the rest in a brokerage. Sounds like you’re doing pretty well. Look into an HSA too
r3vfkb,hmd3qtd,Who can best explain compounding interest? But more specifically the best ways to take advantage of it.,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,3.0,When dealing with stocks youre typically referring to compounding growth (vs compounding interest which is usually used when referring to bank accounts). That said the concept of compounding is the same and semantics aside...  Assuming $1000 invested annually on Jan 1 10% gain/year. This example is for simplicity.  After one year your first $1000 gains $100 = $1100. Total invested: $1000 / Total Value: $1100  After the second year your first $1000 now gains $110 = $1210. Your second $1000 gains $100 = $1100. Total invested: $2000 / Total Value: $2310  After the third year your first $1000 gains $121 = $1331. Your second $1000 gains $110 = $1210. Your third $1000 gains $100 = $1100. Total invested: $3000 / Total Value: $3641  This cycle continues.
r3vfkb,hmd5m4a,Who can best explain compounding interest? But more specifically the best ways to take advantage of it.,thishasntbeeneasy,11/27/2021,1.0,The value of stocks is hopefully increasing but its unrealized until you sell. There is the chance that a stock looks $100 but if you a trying to sell during a crash you might get less than that so its not quite as good as cash from a bank in that sense.  Also note that selling for profits is taxed heavily so buying at $100 and selling at $200 doesnt mean you made $100 (more like $50).
r3vfkb,hmd0etn,Who can best explain compounding interest? But more specifically the best ways to take advantage of it.,t-poke,11/27/2021,2.0,Compounding doesn’t really apply to stock holdings.  Gains are just that. Today a share of a stock with worth $X. Hopefully when it’s time to sell they’re worth significantly more than $X.

I understand that if i sell some shares and take profits then my balance would be the same as i initially invested. But if i didn’t close my position how would they gain interest?
r3vfkb,r3vfkb,Who can best explain compounding interest? But more specifically the best ways to take advantage of it.,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,0.0,I understand the basic concept of it. Any gains should be reinvested and then those gains also make more gains etc. however for example i have a managed portfolio through td Ameritrade which invests into various ETFs. I have automatic deposits so in theory my positions get bigger over time. But how do i know if this is taking advantage of compounding interest?   I can’t wrap my head around the fact that my gains might just be simply that gains. They might not be reinvested to make each position larger if that makes sense. Are they automatically reinvested?   Additionally my other account with TD is what i use to invest in individual stocks. If share prices go up then i make gains on those positions. but again that isn’t compounding. I understand that i can sell my position to take profits and then i have a choice to reinvest or spend it.   I just hear about compound interest all of the time and want to understand how to take advantage of it.   Maybe im caught up in my own head at this point.   Thanks

But more specifically the best ways to take advantage of it.,Cruian,11/27/2021,5.0,But while that compounds the number of shares that doesnt compound your dollar amount (in comparison to had they never distributed dividends) as the share price is reduced by the dividend distribution amount.

r3vfkb,hmd6lo3,Who can best explain compounding interest? But more specifically the best ways to take advantage of it.,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,1.0,For short-term savings I would rather invest in FDIC-insured account because Im guaranteed not to lose the money I invested. If you were to invest in an ETF/MF in a brokerage account that fund could decrease in value (theres no guarantee it will increase or by what amount) and you could be out money when it came time to sell the funds (to access the money).  Risk / Reward

Its almost as if they label it as “compounding interest” but in reality it simply means just not withdrawing funds or touching it for many years lol.   For short term savings would you rather save in an FDIC - insured savings account or an ETF through a brokerage?   I understand all gains are taxed but even after tax it grows more than just sitting in a bank.
r3vfkb,hmd51bg,Who can best explain compounding interest? But more specifically the best ways to take advantage of it.,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,2.0,Assuming youre in the US...  You cant compare a savings account (standard or high-yield) to an IRA as they are meant to serve two entirely different purposes. An IRA is a tax-advantaged account which is meant to be used in retirement where a savings account is not a tax-advantaged account meant to be liquid funds that are accessible at any time.  If the money being invested is for retirement a tax-advantaged account (IRA 401K 403B 457 etc.) is the best place to store the funds for compounding. If the money is meant for short-term use (e.g. house down payment vacation emergency fund etc.) a FDIC-insured savings account is going to be the best place. There are other things like treasury-backed bonds (e.g. Series-I or Series-EE) that could be worthwhile investments for either retirement or savings but that opens up another can of worms.

r3vfkb,hmd7x3w,Who can best explain compounding interest? But more specifically the best ways to take advantage of it.,TinyTerryJeffords,11/27/2021,2.0,Yeah it doesnt make sense because the author misspoke using the term interest but returns on a stock do also compound if the stock continues increasing in value. If you sell every year you realize those gains instead of letting them compound. In this case it would be referred to as a return on your investment not interest. But it does still compound over time.

If the 401k has a match try to invest at least the amount to maximize the free money. 4. Presumably youll have car expenses or need replacement at some point so make sure to budget for that. E.g. Set aside $200/mo for a car now rather than wait till one dies and then not have enough to buy a decent replacement. 5. Save towards a home. 6. Save towards kids future. 7.

I hear buying real estate is a great tool but want to hear other options before pulling a trigger on something that big.

Something like the SPY500 would be ideal. Then once that’s achieved you can start investing in individual securities/crypto. The main goal is to be equal weight diversified in your investing portfolio. Max out your 401k contribution (especially if employer matched) and a side IRA wouldn’t hurt.

All I’m saying is that keeping 6 instead of 3 months of expenses (not income) in cash is the safest easiest thing you can do and does not hinder your wealth building all that much. Have a good life  Edit: I’m a Boglehead we are on the same team but you should know that average S&P growth is not that high no five year period is a sure thing for growth (ten years is another story) and you are mistaken in the way that you calculate percentages (15% for five years is >100% gain for example).

r3vfkb,hmd6eyz,Who can best explain compounding interest? But more specifically the best ways to take advantage of it.,not-now-im-redditing,11/27/2021,2.0,ICompound growth applies to stocks. Compound interest generally does not.   Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) simplifies the growth of an asset that has increased in value over many years to an annual rate of return. That rate of return is the equivalent of compound interest earned each year. For example the stock market has an inflation adjusted historical CAGR between 6-7%. People therefore that invest in a broadly diversified US index fund will often use 6-7% as the growth rate to determine the value of their investment at retirement.   CAGR can also be used to compare results of various investments but there are limitations and assumptions usually in the data being used so YMMV. But in general any asset that goes up in value has a rate of return. The investor may not being paid interest but they are receiving value.
r3r2u7,hmd599m,401k from a former employer; IRA questions,hunt4245,11/27/2021,1.0,Thanks!  I have been looking and reading around in different threads but one specific detail Im not sure about (taxes in general always make me nervous) if I rollover to a Roth when/how do I pay the taxes?  Is it the kind of thing where I would just wait until filing my taxes in a couple months and settle it then (and it would balance with my refund and I would pay the difference if any) or would I need to pay it somehow immediately upon the transfer?
r3r2u7,hmcih6g,401k from a former employer; IRA questions,Jedimind00,11/27/2021,1.0,Im in the exact situation except with my current employer there is a 1 year waiting period until i can begin 401k contributions. The past year i opened up an account through a brokerage and have been contributing to that as i would have been into my 401k. I plan to transfer my old 401k as soon as possible once i hit my 1 year mark. It’s actually next week so I’m excited to get that ball rolling again.
r3r2u7,hmcbccr,401k from a former employer; IRA questions,68_Bullitt,11/27/2021,1.0,>I am trying to figure out if I should open a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA to roll the money into. Or open another account and leave the 401k alone?  If you can afford to pay the tax event it generates now then roll it over into a newly open self-managed Roth IRA. Otherwise a direct rollover into a self-managed Traditional IRA.  Theres so so many threads on this. Read the Prime Directive. In short if you feel your tax liability in retirement may be higher than it is now (or rather you may distribute more cash yearly on average than you make now) then a Roth IRA makes complete sense. Youre young and just starting your career its hard to argue against a Roth IRA IMO.

The 2017 tax reform law updates have narrowed those cases but its still possible.    The upper end of the 35% bracket and the 37% bracket could potentially bring the marriage tax penalty in to play.

r3qy3o,hmcqha8,When is a good time to sell a losing stock,alanmitch34,11/27/2021,3.0,Two thoughts for your consideration: 1. As others have mentioned sell for tax loss purposes to offset some gains. You can always buy the stock back in 31 days to avoid the wash sale rule (if you have regrets or still like the company)  2. If you have 100 shares or more of a stock and decide to sell consider selling a call option instead.  Get paid a little extra to say goodbye. You can sell these in the money (higher probability of selling away)...or press your luck and if needed keep writing new calls after each expiration to generate a nice dividend until you sell them away.

r3qy3o,hmd55pe,When is a good time to sell a losing stock,OptionStrangler,11/27/2021,0.0,When you invest in an individual stock you should do a thorough analysis and figure out a price target for the stock and a time frame for it to reach that target. This shouldn’t be just a number you get from your gut feeling but should be calculated using fundamental valuation methods.  As more data and information become available you should update your analysis to see if the outlook has changed and then you can make a decision if you want to buy more hold or sell.  If a company releases poor financial results and your price target comes down to the point where the investment is no longer worth it you should sell. If the price target remains the same or goes up and your conviction in the stock remains strong you should hold or consider buying more.  Sometimes a stock may dip from volatility but if you have a sound analysis then such dips shouldn’t make you worry or make you consider selling.   Another strategy people use is a stop loss. You should consider which amount of your investment are you comfortable losing. Once losses reach that amount you would sell and close the position.

r3vt2b,hmd3oik,What are the financial benefits of marriage?,OptionStrangler,11/27/2021,8.0,Most of the benefits revolve around taxes. A married couple making a combined $100000 for example will pay less in federal income taxes filing a married joint return than a single person earning $100000 filing a single return.  In addition there are some other benefits. For example if each partner works for a different employer that offers health insurance they have more health insurance options to pick and choose from.  https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0412/why-marriage-makes-financial-sense.aspx
r3qy3o,hmd2cib,When is a good time to sell a losing stock,FutureBarrySeal,11/27/2021,2.0,See if there are any fundamentals for the stocks that would allow it to regain… or just sell and move on. Think of it this way… if there is another opportunity you can put your money in then that might be the way to go. It just really depends but never selling is also pretty bad.

Even if it is a little at a time I makes a big difference.  This may not be the way to go for you but if you are thinking of selling anyways what can it hurt to be paid to sell.

r3qy3o,hmcr9w4,When is a good time to sell a losing stock,BuildingCastlesInAir,11/27/2021,0.0,Most of the other comments say sell as soon as you can and I agree. Hopium is not a strategy. Thats when you hope your investment will improve without any underlying catalyst or fundamental reason.  You should have a basic idea of your goals when investing in a stock but absent that look at your current portfolio and ask yourself if you can identify any current investment that is doing better that youd like to put more money into.   For example lets say the poorly-performing stocks you have all add up to $1000. Wouldnt it be better to put that $1000 into one stock you really believe in rather than hope for 10 stocks of $100 each to all regain their lost potential?   Id also take a long hard look at your investment strategy and consider that maybe youre not good at it. Im not trying to be cruel. But you may be better off paying down any debt and investing in a no- or low-fee index fund to grow your money slowly.  Dollar cost average into this fund over time and live your life frugally while spending leisure time either enjoying life or finding out what your talents are so that you can get money from them. GL.

r3qy3o,hmcarc4,When is a good time to sell a losing stock,SemanticTriangle,11/27/2021,15.0,The way to answer this question is to never have to answer it after the fact.  I would suggest reading What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars by Brendan Moynihan and Jim Paul. The TLDR is that before you buy a position you should write down explicitly all the conditions under which you would sell that position. If those conditions are later met you sell the position no matter what new justification you are able to come up with at the time. This is essentially a stop loss condition that helps you deal with sunk cost fallacy.  If you havent done this then see /u/yes_its_hims [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/r3qy3o/when_is_a_good_time_to_sell_a_losing_stock/hmc7xfw/).

r3vfkb,hmd1coo,Who can best explain compounding interest? But more specifically the best ways to take advantage of it.,thishasntbeeneasy,11/27/2021,3.0,Compounding is that if you have $1000 in the bank gaining 1% interest after a year you now have $1010. Since you left your money in the next year gains slightly more than $10. It seems tiny in the beginning but the growth grows and turns long term savings into millions to retire on (hopefully!)  With stocks the plan should mostly be to leave the money there and hope it grows a decent amount each year. The gains are all unrealized until you sell the stocks while in theory should be a very long time away. If instead you sold part of your stocks every year to keep the balance the same as you initially invested you wouldnt make much interest.
r3vt2b,hmd6s7e,What are the financial benefits of marriage?,oceanleap,11/27/2021,13.0,Another benefit is that you both back up each other. It works in ways other than financial of course but the financial part is real. Its very common for people to go through times of financial hardship in life where they are not bringing in an income. Unemployment bad health having kids bad choices caring for sick family members forced early retirement etc. If you are married hopefully your spouse can support the family during those times and you can support the family when they hit those times. That is a major safety net.
r3vt2b,hmd3dga,What are the financial benefits of marriage?,bassjam1,11/27/2021,30.0,Yeah theres a tax benefit.  And theres other practical financial benefits like sharing the mortgage/rent/ groceries/utilities/furniture (if you both work).  And you might get a car insurance discount.  Theres also a mindset benefit.  No longer are you just working and saving for yourself but also someone else now.  That was huge for me personally.  No longer did I blow any money that wasnt set aside for bills or retirement I started saving more and more.  Which meant my emergency savings went from 1 month to 3 months to 6 months etc.  I was able to squirrel away more and more in my 401k and Roth that I never could find when I was single.
r3r187,hmcjc1x,Billed $345 for back injection at the time of the appointment but got billed again for the same thing at $191?,Frozenlazer,11/27/2021,3.0,When you have a procedure done at a surgery center or hospital or other facility its not a package deal. Typically youll get billed by the facility (for providing the location and equipment and non physician staff) and then by each doctor that treated you. So for a regular surgery a bill from the surgeon and the anesthesiologist are expected. If you had any xrays or other imaging done  youll likely get a bill from a radiologist for reading your images and telling the other doctors what they see.  Also doctors etc do nothing to guarantee results.
r3r187,hmcmxvk,Billed $345 for back injection at the time of the appointment but got billed again for the same thing at $191?,NeonSoldier117,11/27/2021,1.0,Depends firstly on the CPT codes used. Typically a bill like this would be broken into a 3-part claim. Anesthesiology charge Facility (hospital) charge Physician (doctor) charge  Your best bet right now is to get your EOB (explanation of benefits) from your insurance AND a total bill from the provider. Get as much info as possible such as the claim info/CPT code/provider names including the facility. Then play spot the difference between the two documents. Also make sure youre being charged properly i.e. in-network & covered services. Make sure what do these payments go towards? Deductible/coinsurance/copay/out-of-pocket maximum?  If theres a discrepancy or service that wasnt performed you can challenge it. Otherwise ask for some kind of forgiveness or payment plan from the provider.
r3r187,r3r187,Billed $345 for back injection at the time of the appointment but got billed again for the same thing at $191?,Expensive_Historian,11/27/2021,0.0,Went to get a back injection. At the surgery center I paid around $345. Back injection didnt work btw I still have a shit ton of pain. I got billed again for the anesthesia which was around $80. Made sense that they charge that separately. Now I got a bill from the spinal care office (not the surgery center) for the same procedure but at $191.  When I look at my insurance claim the description of the procedure is the same but the amount that the surgery center vs. the doctors office charged my insurance and what insurance paid is different. Why am I getting two bills for the same procedure that I already paid for? Is this what my insurance was able to negotiate down to and would I be able to get the difference back? Im so frustrated because I keep getting these random bills that I wasnt told I was going to get. I am even more pissed that I keep paying for a procedure that did nothing for my pain.
r3qy84,hmck7yr,"Buying out a car lease, pros/cons",Environmental_Put_33,11/27/2021,1.0,If the total of your lease payments + buyout and residual value total equal to the price of the car you negotiated a good lease and might as well buy it out. In order to do that you have to check if the terms of your lease allow for this however. Once they figure out you are under the miles or on pace to turn it in with much less miles than you paid for in the lease terms they will try all sorts of sleazy bullshit in order to get you to turn it in and not buy it out.

I know you have to make payments on time and keep the card usage under a certain limit however my score has been quite fluctuating and Im trying to fix this.   Im concern for my future self as Ive heard that if I want to apply for a loan to get a house or a new credit card they look at your history. Right now is not the best but if I make things right and have it good from now on will my past history affect my future self when applying for loans or a credit card?   How can I build more score?
r3vp1i,hmd2fqt,Wanting to understand credit history for future self.,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1.0,Ask for credit limit increase and apply for a 2nd card. Most banks only report your statement balance to your credit reports once a month. Dont stress too much because past balances arent factored into your credit scores. However in the short term if your reported balance exceeds 10-20% of your credit limit its going to start dropping your credit scores.

Currently dealing with about $11k in credit card debt and low funds the credit card minimums are eating into needed money every month.

r3qy84,hmcbhz1,"Buying out a car lease, pros/cons",68_Bullitt,11/27/2021,2.0,It depends on perspective. If you overpaid for the lease than the con is that youre paying more for the vehicle than you should. On the flipside used car prices are stellar right now.  Have you thought about selling your lease? Many have done that lately very successfully. Walking away with thousands in their pocket. The vast majority of leasers allow this.
r3qy84,hmc8m4u,"Buying out a car lease, pros/cons",thc1967,11/27/2021,3.0,Depends on who youre leasing through. Check your paperwork for terms & conditions of an early buyout. If youre happy with those contact the leasing company and ask for the buyout price. If youre happy with that do it.  Theres not really a downside if you want to own the car... again depending on the leasing companys early buy policy.
r3vqa4,r3vqa4,How to calculate cost basis with imprecise pricing data?,bestjaegerpilot,11/27/2021,2.0,Heres my use case:  - I made my first small investment in the defi space literally about two weeks ago - my projected profits for end of year are in the super low 100s... meaning I wont make very much money by the end of the year * however I still have to report those earnings * unfortunately online services (ex: cointracker) that calculate taxes on defi trading are super expensive * so Ill calculate taxes owed manually (should be straightforward Ive done this before) * and this leads me to the question of this post:  in order to calculate cost basis of coin swaps and earned interest I need the exact USD value of the coin at the time of the taxable event. However the services I have access to (ex: shrimpy.io) only give hourly historical data. In other words they dont give you the USD value of coins at arbitrary points in time.   For example say I sold BNB on November 9 at 3:01pm CST. This service would only give the high and low for that hour (say $10 and $11).   So a simple solution is to take the average of the two values as the cost basis. Is it acceptable to do take the average in the absense of precise historical pricing data?

Perhaps it’s some unique state reg or similar but in those cases the banks involved with the sale wouldn’t allow for that kind of risk to the note holder there will be some kind of insurance against the risk of undisclosed or unknown financial exposures like this specific to this state(s) regulatory atmosphere.   I’ve seen stranger things but I can’t fathom how a contract with one party could become the responsibility of another party without some kind of agreement from the new party (blind or not and in the sale of a large asset there are many well informed players).   In either case there’s more complexity here that is disconnected from the needs of this post and in the end it’s still not the asset that holds the account.

My guess is that this is typically their policy and someone got lazy or it now needs to be added to their policy for opening accounts. They know they have no leverage with the old owner because that person likely already paid their final bill and fully closed their account.   I really cant imagine how they can try to make you pay this since this really seems to their fault unless they have fine print about this on anything you signed.  Also you may want to mention reaching out to the utility commissioners office to ensure they dont shut off your service while you look into this. If that doesnt work Im sure there are some city officials you could call/email and worse case reach out to the utility companies executive team on LinkedIn.

If Im reading this correctly there is a gas leak and it was not repaired when you purchased the home. The utility company was estimating the monthly costs of usage but only found out in Aug 2021 that they were understating it and the determined the amount owed for the last 2 years was $800?  Couple of questions:  1. If you provide proof of the repair and show the closing documents of you being the new owner will they waive the amount due?  2. Im assuming youve already spoken to a supervisor can you speak to someone in the disputes department?  3. Can you Google utility commissioner for [city/utility company] and submit a complaint?  4. Did you have an inspector done during escrow? How was this missed?  5. Was the repair person from the utility company who advised you to take a photo? Im assuming no and that it was just good advice. I would ask the utility company for proof of them reading the meter once you set up your utility account. If they dont have proof that should be something you use in your complaint to the utility commissioner.  6. Sometimes title/escrow will withhold 2-3x the monthly utility bills to take care of unpaid balances but this isnt super common in my experiences. Can you check your closing documents to see if anything was withheld? You can reach out to your contact from closing to see if anything was withheld during the settlement.

r3us51,hmcwjnp,Auto rebalance with Transamerica?,mt06111,11/27/2021,1.0,You might need to edit more. You mention gaining 6% since summer then mention 1% “since the year”. What does that mean?
r3us51,r3us51,Auto rebalance with Transamerica?,UnusualIntroduction0,11/27/2021,0.0,I have a 403b through my job that I started giving max contributions to this year. I have it set up as a 30 year target date fund. As of last week I had earned by about 6 percent since this summer. Then a few days ago I got an email that it auto rebalanced and when I checked it today I had gained less than 1% total. Was there a big market dip that might account for this or was it part of the rebalance or was there a fee associated that decimated my earnings or is there some other reason Im not thinking of? The associated 401a is up about 12%. Any help is greatly appreciated.  Edit for clarification

A lien is placed on a property for a debt an individual owns. The property doesn’t actually hold the account the person still does. A lien just gives them rights to extract their value from the equity of the asset if/when the individual won’t/can’t pay.   In this case the prior individual doesn’t own the asset and a lien wasn’t filed before the asset was sold to the now current owner (a different individual). If it was the lien would have absolutely been brought up during finance and titling.   So no I’m not wrong. :)  I.e: a “thing” cannot own a financial arrangement. A person does. You have never seen a utility company have an account that belongs to an asset and not a person. Ever.

r3uini,hmcyc21,Inherited Silver Coins,ivanthemute,11/27/2021,10.0,First things first catalog everything.  Just like you said..  Denomination year type etc.  Having this will allow a valuation to run much more smoothly.  2nd check eBay sold listings for those.  Additionally for common coinage you can use Coinflation for melt value.  3rd search for a local coin store or club and get their valuations.  Tell them exactly what you told us you have no sentimental attachment but youre also in no rush to sell.  Ask them the retail price and what theyd pay you for them.  Let them know that you know they have a business and you understand.  A good honest coin dealer will be willing to tell you both.  4th decide what youre going to do.  Armed with the knowledge you pick up on your own and from others you can make that call.  As for the should you/should you not?  Im a fan of collecting and my go-to is no you shouldnt but thats purely of a personal preference.  You do you friend and good luck!

However I would theorize that having bizarre score ranges makes it easier to identify when people have no clue what theyre talking about.

So for example say $500 of a $2000 is immediately available and you spend it .. then 3 days later the bank realizes the check is no good and they take back their money .. you’re out $500 and if you overdraft that’s extra money in fees.

You should call and see if they did a reading when they switched the account over to you.  I called to have them set up my account when I purchased my home and I believe they did a reading shortly after.  &#x200B  I believe the estimates are also based off of the previous years bill so you might be using more gas and electricity than the previous owner.

How is this your problem? The account (and any billing arrangement) should be in the prior owners name not your name. Your account would be a whole new account that now has the service property tied to it. New readings and all done on the date of the new account activation.   A service property can’t “own” a balance an individual does. Otherwise every time a renter moves outs there’d be chaos with accounting at the utility company.   Are you saying you activated service had a leak during/after that initial month(s) of service and are now being billed for it?   If it’s usage during the time that you activated the account it’s billable. Whatever the prior account had should be completely irrelevant as it’s not related to your account.

r3vbdr,r3vbdr,Getting out of credit card debt after losing it all,browser1994,11/27/2021,13.0,Hello everyone  I used to have a successful business. COVID took a massive toll on my business and I ended up in about $30000 business credit card debt with no income (unable to keep paying myself from the business) and struggling to make minimum payments on the cards each month.  Unable to pay off my AMEX Platinum in full like I had been each month for an entire year before AMEX enrolled me into their financial relief program. I am thankful for this option because in the duration of the program annual card fees are paused and the APR is lowered to 5.99% in my case.  Now my problem is with my Chase business ink card which carries about 18k in debt with an APR of 15.99%. Does Chase offer any relief programs during this time that wont negatively impact my credit score (its already gone down 100 points in the last year). What would you suggest I do in this situation? Is there any way I can negotiate with Chase?  At least now I am employed but not bringing in a lot of money. Half of my income goes toward rent at this time. The other half I use to live very frugally and pay down my debts. Yes I am looking for a higher paying job and possible side hustles I can do that are not capital intensive and I will be moving in with family to eliminate the rent expense early next year.  Sometimes I wonder if I should just file for personal bankruptcy since my credit score has already gone down into the 600s. Aside from the business debt I also have personal credit card debt. Which thankfully I am able to start paying down from unemployment money I received before gaining employment.  What should I do?

r3v4id,hmczide,Should I take a personal check for a car?,nothlit,11/27/2021,8.0,Its a classic scam that relies on people thinking that funds available means check cleared. The check is fake or fraudulent. The receiving bank makes the funds available after a few days as required by law but the check itself can still bounce days or weeks later. In the meantime the scammer uses various tactics to get the victim to send some of the money back to them leaving the victim ultimately in the hole for whatever they sent after the check inevitably bounces.

Or is there some sort of maximum contribution per pay period as well? If it helps I get paid monthly so my next monthly check will be 12/24/2021.

Bench/squat/deadlifts are fun but if you’re looking to get into shape they aren’t needed. A PF is more than adequate equipment wise for the vast majority of people to get into shape.   Imo if you’re just starting out at going to a gym chose the cheapest option. Once there if you realize you want more find a gym that offers that. If you find out you still want more keep looking. PF is a fantastic start since they are cheap and have a lot of basic equipment.

r3pmn2,hmbzl2c,I built a really bad portfolio...,Default87,11/27/2021,5.0,I would instead look up the concept of a 3 fund portfolio.  then it depends on where this money is.  if this money is in a tax advantaged account (like an IRA 401k HSA etc) then just sell and rebuy your new portfolio.  there is no tax implications of that.  if this money is in a taxable brokerage account then it depends on how much money we are talking about.  if this is only $10k then any tax implications of selling and rebuying will be minimal so its likely a good idea to just rip the bandaid off and fix it.  if you are talking about $100k+ then your tax implications are likely significant so I would at least make sure new contributions are going towards a better portfolio balance and then look for strategic opportunities to sell these old holdings to minimize taxes and work to get your portfolio turned around.

r3pmn2,hmcsgry,I built a really bad portfolio...,samicballs,11/27/2021,1.0,I get that but Im just re-evaluating my portfolio and I think that it will not do well over the long term. I have really no exposure to mid-small cap stocks other sectors and international markets. I want to start fresh with a 3 fund portfolio where I will stay the course.
r3pmn2,hmci5pk,I built a really bad portfolio...,justLouis,11/27/2021,2.0,Stop trying to daytrade etfs over any extended period of time the market trends up and to the right. This day to day market sell off is a great time to buy more the companies inside the etf havent changed and are still solid companies until theyre determined not to be.
r3pmn2,hmc7lvf,I built a really bad portfolio...,dequeued,11/27/2021,3.0,Is that all in a taxable brokerage account or is this an IRA or other tax-advantaged account?  Are you at Fidelity?
r3pmn2,hmcsnlh,I built a really bad portfolio...,samicballs,11/27/2021,1.0,See normally I would completely agree investing for the long haul is good. But after doing to re-evaluation I dont think that my investments will hold up for the long term which is why I want to start fresh with a portfolio that will hold up. Its not finalized that I will sell but Im just thinking about it.
r3pmn2,hmcznm9,I built a really bad portfolio...,samicballs,11/27/2021,1.0,Ive held for a very short amount of time (1-2 months) I dont think any distributions have been made.
r3pmn2,hmcuq1b,I built a really bad portfolio...,justLouis,11/27/2021,1.0,I would get rid of your VOO if its considered long term by now unless you dont mind short term capital gains tax and stick with your fidelity index funds.
r3pmn2,hmc7dgn,I built a really bad portfolio...,Default87,11/27/2021,5.0,dont try to time the market.  this new variant is irrelevant to the decision here and doesnt change anything that I said in my response.
r3pmn2,hmct0kc,I built a really bad portfolio...,samicballs,11/27/2021,1.0,I am with fidelity and its a taxable brokerage acct. Its really not a lot of money which is kinda swaying my idea to start fresh.
r3pmn2,hmc13fj,I built a really bad portfolio...,samicballs,11/27/2021,1.0,Something like a 3-4 fund portfolio is what im looking to make in the future. I just dont know if i should I be worried about the new South African variant affecting the market. These are all mutual funds besides VOO so I cant exactly sell at a great time.
r3pmn2,hmd075q,I built a really bad portfolio...,dequeued,11/27/2021,2.0,Yeah. You can just switch without a huge tax bill then. Just bear in mind that if the value of the funds has appreciated you will need to pay capital gains tax on the gains and the tax rate is higher if youve held them less than a year (its basically taxed at the same rate as your marginal income tax rate).  The investing section of the PF wiki has more information on funds three-funds portfolios etc.
r3pmn2,hmc7lj8,I built a really bad portfolio...,EthanWS6,11/27/2021,3.0,Why would you stay the course when you specifically dont like the course?
r3pmn2,hmc7egi,I built a really bad portfolio...,dequeued,11/27/2021,14.0,Tune out the noise. Youre not investing for a few weeks or months.
r3pmn2,hmce1nr,I built a really bad portfolio...,t-poke,11/27/2021,3.0,> I just dont know if i should I be worried about the new South African variant affecting the market  The market took an absolute beating yesterday because of the new variant. It still closed higher than it did 6 weeks ago.  Youre investing for the long haul. Whatever happens in the next few weeks or months with this variant isnt even going to be a blip on the radar when you need to start selling your investments.

r3pmn2,hmcbrdm,I built a really bad portfolio...,68_Bullitt,11/27/2021,3.0,Many of these funds are duplicating holdings. You could do a simple 2 fund portfolio and accomplish what you want.  For example Im with Vanguard. Im 70/30 VTSAX/VGT. That allows me to capture the entire US Market with a portion dedicated towards Technology. This makes me technology heavy but thats my personal preference.

r3pmzw,r3pmzw,Need help to determine if trading in my car is the right decision.,thejumbowumbo,11/27/2021,2.0,I own a 2017 Honda Civic. Honda has sent me letters and called me to try to get me to trade it in for a 2022 model. I bought my civic for $21000. I owe 11000 on it still. Honda says they are willing to buy my car for between 12 and 18 thousand and a new 2022 civic would cost roughly 22000. My car has about 45000 miles on it now. My car is in fair condition. Firstly why is Honda so desperate for my car? I know there has been a shortage in production but they clearly have new cars as they want to sell one to me. Secondly is this a worthwhile deal?  &#x200B  Edit: Thank you to everyone that replied! It seems clear that I would be getting the raw end of the deal. I had a suspicion that I wouldnt be improving my position but I thought I would verify with this community. I really appreciate the information.

We will do our best to file taxes but it is a dark art. Hiring a CPA is the only option - something I have never done. :)
r3qahc,hmc8i4s,Wife earned some money on the side. Not sure what to do.,UMfan11244,11/27/2021,65.0,So if she had $30k in transactions that doesn’t mean it’s $30k in profit. You need to find out her expenses.
r3qahc,hmcm5nr,Wife earned some money on the side. Not sure what to do.,dswpro,11/27/2021,2.0,There are also lots of experienced tax preparers out there. Ask around and get a good referral. They deal with small businesses and side-hustles all the time.
r3qahc,r3qahc,Wife earned some money on the side. Not sure what to do.,norcalsocial,11/27/2021,23.0,My income has always been salary based. Recently my wife started trading physical collectibles. She kept no records of purchases / sales or other expenses. She doesnt have a business registered either. For her it is the labor of love and it worked better than expected. For the year she has about $30k in sales as best as I am able to put together looking at her transaction history of paypal and other money transfer services. Adding that to my income we are certainly owed taxes.  How should we file taxes in this case? Should we just estimate the expenses and earnings given we dont have proper records? Under what heading can we file taxes? Should we rush to form a business now? I am not sure if she would continue this the next year.
r3qahc,hmcks14,Wife earned some money on the side. Not sure what to do.,norcalsocial,11/27/2021,4.0,Agreed. The actual profit will be less but without I am worried that without sales invoice all we have got are a bunch of paypal transactions. I am not sure if IRS would accept that.
r3qahc,hmch91v,Wife earned some money on the side. Not sure what to do.,PetraLoseIt,11/27/2021,10.0,She definitely needs to start tracking her expenses and income/sales *now* and do some work to get her records for the past as accurate as they can be. Also if paying the extra taxes might be a problem: start saving for them now by setting aside any income shes making from now until March or so. Going forward have her set side a safe percentage of her income for this.    If she does keep doing this you guys may need to start paying quarterly estimated taxes from 2022 onwards. See the [IRS FAQ](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/estimated-tax).
r3qahc,hmc7wti,Wife earned some money on the side. Not sure what to do.,dswpro,11/27/2021,13.0,Speak to an accountant about a schedule C or other options  If she was buying and selling there may be an audit trail you have not thought of that can lead you to a reasonable estimate of the cost and profit in these items. Certainly she should keep accurate records going forward. Youd be surprised how many businesses start exactly this way. No reason for her to discontinue making money.

Your 2017 civic as long as you keep up on maintenance will take you to the moon and back. Honda is the 2nd most reliable car company and theyre pretty close to 1st. Which is toyota.
r3pua5,r3pua5,Employer non-compliant with 403b contributions,ElderberryLoud5990,11/27/2021,10.0,Id appreciate a sanity check on whether to continue to encourage someone to pursue possible back retirement contributions from a recent employer. They worked at a non-profit that has as a benefit a 403b with a set employer contribution of a percentage of pay and employees had the option to contribute up to the annual IRS maximum.   However despite being eligible for the plan (over 20 hours/wk etc)  they were first not told about it and then when they found out after about 2 years about this plan it they were told that it would get straightened out. I suspect the financial person was stalling to try to find a way for them to be ineligible although as other hourly W2 employees working over 20 hours/wk were included I dont see how that was possible.   After 2 more years of trying to get the employer to address it and during the process of them leaving employment the non-profit says they are depositing what would have been the employer contribution - the percentage of salary - as a lump sum into their newly-opened retirement account (I think they can keep the 403b after they leave).   They havent said anything about making up for the fact that they didnt give information about the plan to them in the first place then balked when called on it and then took 4+ years to resolve it. But according to [IRS.gov](https://IRS.gov) it looks like to be in compliance they need to contribute a percentage of what the employee was entitled to contribute as the employee lost out on that opportunity. As its not an employee-contribution-only 403b I think its subject to ERISA.   I think theyre burned out on it and would be happy to get the base amount - but in my very inexpert option it looks like it would be worth pursuing. Thank you for any take on this!

r3pmzw,hmcopxu,Need help to determine if trading in my car is the right decision.,SigmaLance,11/27/2021,1.0,The only way that I would make this deal is if they actually gave me $18k. Which they won’t. They will low ball you to lock you into an even longer contract to keep your money flowing in.
r3pmzw,hmbzqyt,Need help to determine if trading in my car is the right decision.,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,30.0,They aren’t desperate for your car.   They’re trying to sell you a new car
r3pmzw,hmc1mq8,Need help to determine if trading in my car is the right decision.,Squid1622,11/27/2021,5.0,Do not sell your car. With low mileage like that you should be able to keep your car running for a few more years. Right now prices are hella inflated and inventory is low. Dealerships that were turning $3k gpu are now in the mid $5-6k range on gpu. If you sell it now you’re just keeping yourself stuck in a debt cycle. There is a huge push among larger dealers and used car companies to shorten the amount of time a person owns a car too. The market standard for car sales is once every five years. Many are trying to push that to 3 years. They don’t make a ton of money on the vehicles themselves. The majority of that gpu is made up in ancillary fees after market items and other add ons. Additionally you’d likely be trading lower insurance premiums for higher ones.
r3pmzw,hmc0f4e,Need help to determine if trading in my car is the right decision.,soju_shower,11/27/2021,11.0,Let me rant first about how much I hate car dealerships. I just helped someone buy a car yesterday and spent half the day at a dealership that has no haggle pricing so youd think everything is fast right? They kept adding fees that they had to go back and remove. Theyre trying to get you in the door. Its true there is a shortage and they do want to flip your car but I dont think youre going to get the offer you think youre going to get. Youll get the lower end of the estimate and God know how much market adjustment theyll put on that new civic. One of the Honda dealers I went to said they only had 5 new cars and all had markups over 1500. If you want to waste a good afternoon give it a shot but your current car and mileage is just broken in.
r3pmzw,hmcrqax,Need help to determine if trading in my car is the right decision.,thejumbowumbo,11/27/2021,1.0,Makes sense thanks!
r3pmzw,hmbzopy,Need help to determine if trading in my car is the right decision.,t-poke,11/27/2021,8.0,> Firstly why is Honda so desperate for my car?  Well Honda the car company couldn’t care less. This is a dealer that’s reaching out to you.   It’s a sales pitch. They’re not desperate for anything. They’d be sending you the letter if you drove a Geo Metro that had to be pushed into the dealership. They want to sell you a new car simple as that.

Even if our first instinct says no way i can imagine a toxic company trying such stunt. Lets hope its just that a stunt without legal foundation to back it up and thats quite possible. (Source: Family members had to do with a shady employer just randomly doing toxic things and asking for stuff.)   Obviously we can hardly check it for you and even if we could most of us arent in the position to give you legal advice so thats your best bet.

r3vzls,r3vzls,First time buying a used car. Dealership is pricing the car decently over market value. How to start negotiations?,Gutkrusha,11/27/2021,1.0,Im looking at a 2018 Hyundai Accent with 56686 miles on it.  Using three of the best known car value websites (Nada Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds) the market value of the vehicle is shown as follows: KBB: 14048 - 15919 NADA: 14650 Edmunds: 13905 - 15343  The dealership has their website price as $16442 and have the whole price reduced by $1500! above the price. I have already been pre-approved via my credit union for $16087.50.   Ive read a few guides on negotiating used car sales (Im a very introverted person and have never negotiated anything in my life) and most say to offer under market value but not be insulting. Theyre asking quite a bit over market value already so I have no idea what is or isnt considered insulting to them.  I obviously dont have more than $16087 to work with out the door with the vehicle and im not entirely sure how to seal a favorable deal.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  EDIT: I have a meeting to check out the car in person tomorrow afternoon at 3PM.

r3vzls,hmd5ofo,First time buying a used car. Dealership is pricing the car decently over market value. How to start negotiations?,i_am_viet,11/27/2021,1.0,Best way to negotiate is to get a competing offer from a different local dealership for a similar car. Ask the other dealership to beat the offer. Repeat this by going back and forth until the dealerships yield.  The actual offers (and the resultant best offer) from local dealerships represents the value your market is willing to price the car.  Numbers from a car value resource like KBB don’t mean much to a dealership.

r3qnog,hmc7l91,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,2nra95,11/27/2021,4.0,Take it from this perspective if this membership makes the cost of taking care of yourself 30-50 years in the future lower then hell yeah its worth it. If this boosts your confidence which in turn leads to you landing a great job once you get your degree then hell yeah its worth it!!  There isnt an easy way to make a solid correlation in the examples that I provided... But I think taking care of yourself is hella worth it no matter what it takes

Edit: context from another comment: I had a nice home gym setup where I had a treadmill a combination machine for upper body and a barbell and bumper plates going up to 240lbs.
r3qnog,hmcwqdf,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,yellowcanvas,11/27/2021,1.0,Trust me Im pissed too. Id rather walk 10 mins than drive 10 mins and pay an extra $30. The hours are inconvenient and its always packed but I was willing to work around it until all the frat boys got back on campus. I used to go very regularly over the summer when campus was empty.
r3qnog,hmd97yw,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,anticon1999,11/27/2021,1.0,Gyms really provide better value per hour than almost any other pastime. Think of the cost of going to a movie bar even a coffee shop.   So I tend to find it pays for itself to a degree as youre not wasting money elsewhere plus the obvious health benefits.
r3w0c6,hmd6g5x,Prioritizing House Savings vs Fun?,MediumExplorer,11/27/2021,1.0,You are right. I’m thinking I would rather use the money I save to travel once the pandemic is over.   I’m sure these cars will eventually get cheaper. Tbh I never wanted to spend $50k on a car but used Teslas go for the same price if not more than new. There is no other car that has the instant acceleration that was so much fun to me. The other EVs aren’t sporty (like the Leaf Bolt etc).  I’m currently invested in VTWAX in my 401k and Roth IRA and thinking of putting the money I would have put on a down payment into stocks ($11000 in 60% VTI 40% VXUS $4000 spread across tech stocks like GOOG NVDA AMD)
r3w0c6,hmd4cyf,Prioritizing House Savings vs Fun?,THIS_IS_BONES_,11/27/2021,2.0,I think one way to look at this is it determine how much you want to save for a home.  2k a month is 24k a year verses almost 15k a year so if you wanted 100k so 4.1 years versus 6.6 years and a Tesla   (I’m sure you’ll make more money over time or you can be less aggressive with your investing but it’s one way to think about it)

How to start negotiations?,BeardedSquirrel94,11/27/2021,4.0,Unfortunately I don’t think these sites are able to keep up with some especially volatile markets not since the start of the pandemic. The most you can do is show them these stats ask them what makes their vehicle worth more and then possibly offer a common figure in those ranges.

r3w0c6,hmd7gd3,Prioritizing House Savings vs Fun?,o2msc,11/27/2021,3.0,You live in a very HCOL area with a $900000 median home process. I would be saving as much as possible to put a big dent in that one day. It’s really whatever you prioritize though. You don’t need a Tesla to “have fun and enjoy life.” You can do that in a Toyota.
r3vxia,r3vxia,Joint Mortgage and Individual vs Joint Income,cynwniloc,11/27/2021,1.0,Let’s say two people apply for a joint mortgage. They both have 800 credit scores but person A makes $10000 per month while person B makes only $1000 per month.  If the mortgage payments are $1500 per month will the fact that person B’s commitment is 75% of his monthly income be looked down upon by the lender or will it not matter because the total commitment is only 14% of the total joint income?

r3qpbi,hmcc0az,Odd dealership question.,68_Bullitt,11/27/2021,6.0,> But I dont understand what the dealer has to gain out of this. Why are they so eager to move this vehicle?  Theyre likely selling it to OP at an extremely high price and/or interest rate. I can assure you its not because its in the OPs interest.
r3qpbi,hmcu4z2,Odd dealership question.,series_hybrid,11/27/2021,1.0,Imagine you buy the car under those circumstances. Then...a week later they contact you saying that they discovered the lie and now you dont qualify for the financing they promised so they are offering you a much higher interest rate.  The car has a week of miles on it and can no longer be sold as new so you would be liable for the lost value plus you still need a car and the down payment money is gone.  Do you like being taken advantage of by unscrupulous scammers?
r3qpbi,hmc6ory,Odd dealership question.,wrldruler21,11/27/2021,2.0,Did the dealer want you to give the bank a higher or lower number than reality?

r3qpbi,hmc6ytb,Odd dealership question.,Consistent-Reach-152,11/27/2021,6.0,The dealer probably inflated the downpayment to make the loan look safer to the bank so the OP would get the loan and the dealer would make the sale.  If you dont want the loan called and made immediately payable dont say anything to the bank.  You should really really inspect the car carefully as the dealer is dishonest.
r3qpbi,hmc7uk7,Odd dealership question.,Fianna_Bard,11/27/2021,11.0,Walk no run away from that dealership.

r3vwu5,hmd9a61,401k -> ira -> backdoor Roth IRA a good idea?,Izikiel23,11/27/2021,1.0,Ok that explains a lot thanks! I will check the distributions thing in my plan .
r3vwu5,hmd647a,401k -> ira -> backdoor Roth IRA a good idea?,1hotjava,11/27/2021,2.0,There’s two thugs you are talking about:  Backdoor Roth IRA. That’s for people who make too much to contribute to a Roth IRA. It’s limited to $6k/yr and there’s plenty of ways to screw it up and get hit with penalties. You aren’t at that income level yet you can just do regular Roth IRA  Mega Backdoor Roth: this one is different in that you CAN exceed the $6k BUT your 401k plan at work has to have two features that most plans don’t. You must be able to do the after-tax contributions sounds like you are good there. The other thing is that it must allow for in service distributions. You have to be able to roll that after tax contribution out of the 401k and into a Roth IRA. Most plans don’t allow that. BTW this is another one where it’s easy to screw it up and get hit with penalties.
r3vwu5,hmd41rs,401k -> ira -> backdoor Roth IRA a good idea?,1hotjava,11/27/2021,2.0, >then maxing ira (as my gross income would be reduced) and then once I hit the limits for the year contribute some money after tax to a Roth IRA   The max you can contribute to an IRA is $6k/yr. that’s combined between traditional and Roth so if you max the traditional IRA at $6k you are done with IRAs   >backdoor Roth IRA.  Backdoor Roth is for people who make too much to contribute to a Roth IRA. It’s not a way to do more IRA beyond $6k. Even when doing a Backdoor Roth you are still limited to $6k
r3vwu5,r3vwu5,401k -> ira -> backdoor Roth IRA a good idea?,Izikiel23,11/27/2021,1.0,So my employer offers 401k with after tax contributions and daily cash conversions. I was wondering what would be the better route maxing 401k then maxing ira (as my gross income would be reduced) and then once I hit the limits for the year contribute some money after tax to a Roth IRA using the backdoor or just contributing to the 401k then using backdoor Roth IRA. I’m earning around 125k a year.  Which option would be better tax wise?  Sorry if it seems a silly question I’ve moved to the us recently and I’ve read a bit about all this however I can’t figure out what to do.
r3vwu5,hmdadzn,401k -> ira -> backdoor Roth IRA a good idea?,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,1.0,Check out the FIRE flowchart to make sure all other bases are covered. https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ecn2hk/fire_flow_chart_version_42/  Talk with your HR representative about doing megabackdoor Roth IRA (after tax 401k rolled into Roth). Youll do the regular backdoor IRA yourself totally separate save the end account.
r3vwu5,hmd4z14,401k -> ira -> backdoor Roth IRA a good idea?,Izikiel23,11/27/2021,1.0,With the mega backdoor Roth IRA can’t you basically contribute all the after tax money of a 401k into a Roth IRA?
r3vwu5,hmd8lpr,401k -> ira -> backdoor Roth IRA a good idea?,Nagisan,11/27/2021,1.0,> You have to be able to roll that after tax contribution out of the 401k and into a Roth IRA. Most plans don’t allow that.    Alternatively you can get close to this if your plan instead allows in-service conversions to a Roth 401k. My plan *does* allow that conversion so I can mega backdoor roth from after-tax to Roth 401k...when I leave this employer *then* I can roll over into a Roth IRA from there. So even if they dont allow in-service 401k -> IRA you might still be able to leverage mega backdoor roth.

This company is known for being toxic and having a bad culture. This is a professional level job in IT Sales. She was working for 9 months then decided to quit to pursue a different position and the company she left Finance/Payroll department reached out and said she owes them 56k and to wire it to their company bank account. I checked the emails and the bank account is legit. I went to her payroll manager and added up all the gross pay from her 8 months of paychecks and that totals 56k gross pay. Is this even legal? What should we do here? We replied back and said that this request is a mistake. We have not agreed to any form of payment so no slip ups there. Also they are asking us to send gross pay rather than net pay which is actually 45k so this just doesn’t make sense. Any help here is appreciated!  Edit: There is no repayment clause in the contract. No commission advancement. Just a clearly stated base pay with opportunity to earn on target earnings. Cookie cutter offer letter employment contract that you would see in any other fortune 500 firm.

r3w0c6,r3w0c6,Prioritizing House Savings vs Fun?,MediumExplorer,11/27/2021,0.0,Outside of maxing my 401k and Roth IRA I’m able to save an extra $2k a month right now. I’m thinking of purchasing a car for $50k (TesIa ModeI 3 might be $8k cheaper if federal EV incentive passes). This would allow me to save $760 less per month. I’m in my early 20s and am unsure how to proceed.  On the one hand the opportunity cost is high I could have an extra $750 a month to invest on the other hand I believe in enjoying life. How do I approach this? I make $120k a year and median home price is $900k. My current $2k a month is going for a house savings fund. I hope that as my income increases (or I find a spouse) that I can one day purchase a home.

r3w0c6,hmd8sqd,Prioritizing House Savings vs Fun?,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,5.0,I get the automobiles as a hobby thing but from a purely financial perspective its not a smart move.  You might be looking at a jumbo mortgage for a $900K house requiring $180K for down payment (20%). Assuming the $1250/mo savings rate you would need to save for like 12 years to accumulate that. Who knows what that $900K house (now) would cost then.
r3w0c6,hmd87c0,Prioritizing House Savings vs Fun?,MediumExplorer,11/27/2021,-4.0,It’s not depreciating quite the opposite. Used teslas are going for more than new because people are impatient with the long wait times.

I don’t care what they tell you about the contract. Don’t believe them. Read it yourself before signing anything.
r3qnog,r3qnog,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,yellowcanvas,11/27/2021,13.0,Context: Im a college student and make about $900-1.2k a month. I usually spend $300-500 a month (higher end when I get my hair/eyebrows/personal maintenance things done). I keep a spreadsheet and it looks like most of my expenses are for personal grooming food and shopping.   Luckily I dont need to pay rent utilities or groceries just gas and a Spotify subscription. Would a $30/month gym membership be worth it? We do have a gym on campus but I find the hours and the walk inconvenient there are barely any racks available and there are a lot of creeps. I also dont like seeing my peers when Im working out.  And could someone recommend a budget for fun money/shopping/personal grooming? Ive tried budgeting $100 for fun money but I categorize that as fair tickets concert tickets etc not food and shopping so I always exceed it.   Further context:   Food: Im trying to meal plan and wake up early enough to not have to buy food and Im trying to cut down on eating out with friends too (this is where most of it comes from).   Personal grooming: eyebrows and maintaining my hair. Eyebrows are every 1-2 months and hair is every 3-4 months but hair is anywhere from ($30-$200).   Shopping: I...have no clothes right now. So I look for sales and hold off until I find something I will actually wear for a while but Ive almost skipped class before because I didnt have pants left. (I also gained a lot of weight so a lot of my old jeans and pants dont fit.)  Would adding a $30 month cost be worth it?? I feel a little stupid already because I feel like I have no bills so there is absolutely no reason I shouldnt be able to save at least $800 a month.

You can also likely go in and ask to just tour the facility to see what they offer. I’ve never been to a gym that wouldn’t let somebody walk through and check out to see what they have.
r3qnog,hmd4gil,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,WeeniePops,11/27/2021,1.0,I would say absolutely. $30 a month is stupid cheap compared to most gyms and even though it may be a net loss on the money side investing in your health and well being is always one of the best things you can do for yourself. You will look better feel better have more energy and more motivation to go after your goals. I would always recommend a healthy diet and exercise regime as it will improve multiple aspect of your life and $30 is a very small price to pay for that. Besides whats the point of having money if you cant be healthy/live long enough to enjoy it? I say go for it.

Lastly I heard some banks will give .25 or .50 percent reductions on mortgages to people who have money in accounts with the bank for a few months. Could these give the best rates? It can’t be too hard to just open an account and transfer money for a few months right?
r3w1gb,hmda0zn,How to Find the Best Mortgage,Money_Maketh_Man,11/27/2021,1.0,her is my advise for handling the lender  1: get an offer /pre approval from you current main bank.  2: get at least 2 other offer.  looks for at least one form a discount bank like quicken loans rocketmortgage etc  you should never leand that much money and look at less than 3 offers
r3w1gb,hmd9uyo,How to Find the Best Mortgage,cynwniloc,11/27/2021,1.0,None of my friends own property unfortunately and I’m moving to a new state to buy a home. So I guess that just leaves google for finding a lender?  Also how do I get preapproved if I don’t know how much the house will cost?
r3qnog,hmd3hmo,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,FutureBarrySeal,11/27/2021,1.0,Yes. If you’re actually going and depending on what all the gym Provides. It seems like planet fitness is doing $10/month to 1 location or $20/nation wide membership. Or just shop around…. That way you can save a tiny little bit. Just ignore the creeps. Though I’d assume at planet fitness there will be less people trying to talk to you.   Maybe for you you could try just putting away an X amount for savings per month and the rest is all free money to do w/e you want. So if you’re happy putting away $300 or $500 then put that away and spend the rest on w/e else. If you have left over at the end of the month then great! More to savings.
r3qnog,hmcxifr,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,Nicofatpad,11/27/2021,2.0,People don’t allocate enough money to their gym memberships honestly and the rates of $10-20 for commercial fitness centers like planet fitness and retro fitness really distorted the value of a gym membership.  People spend around $10-20 on subscriptions they barely use yet wont spend any more on something as important as the gym. To me a $30-40 gym membership at a decent gym that has what you need and maintains their equipment is a great deal. I’ve had memberships in the range of $60-70 for hobbyist powerlifting gyms.  If you’re going at least 2.5-3 times a week a $30-40 membership is well worth it. I’ve also found that memberships in those ranges are easier to cancel…The $10-25 range is usually only that cheap cause they’re capable of scamming people out of their money by making it virtually impossible to cancel thus getting passive income from people who don’t even use their equipment. A proper market price really is $30-40.

HE opted out of getting surgery and just took antibiotics instead. Doctor told him to stay another day for observation so he did. now he got a letter in the mail saying insurance denied his hospital stay because he didnt meet certain criteria and that he could appeal. I have never even heard of a health insurance denying a legit (or even non-legit) ER visit. The man had acute appendicitis as confirmed by an md and imaging. How to resolve this ? please advise.

r3uini,hmcuyjv,Inherited Silver Coins,93195,11/27/2021,5.0,Assuming these are common circulated coins it’s not a huge value.  The silver in a dollar is worth around $20 a quarter more like $4.  Silver certificates Indian head or wheat pennies nothing special either.  Value wise you’re probably talking in the hundreds not thousands.  You can take them to a pawn shop or coin dealer for an offer or just sell them yourself on E-Bay.
r3uini,hmcwxyo,Inherited Silver Coins,TodaysMenace,11/27/2021,2.0,Top dollar for these usually comes from auctions. Find a local auction house that will list them for you either in lots or as single items or both. Make sure the auction house utilizes online auctioning.   Good luck!
r3uini,r3uini,Inherited Silver Coins,ram921,11/27/2021,1.0,My grandmother passed away and among other things left me a large ceramic piggy bank that is filled with silver coins - mostly silver dollars silver half-dollars and silver quarters. (There are other currency denominations as well - very old pennies silver certificates etc... but I have been waiting until post-Thanksgiving to do an actual detailed inventory).   My question is what do I do with them?   * Im not a coin collector.  * I dont have any real sentimental value attached to them. I didnt even know they were a thing until recently.  * I dont particularly need money right now. * Do I hold on to them? And if so why?  * Do I sell them? And if so how do I best determine their worth and get the best price?   Thanks!
r3tkiz,hmcp9w8,Should I pay off my car?,fkkoojngo,11/27/2021,3.0,If the car interest rate is low lets say like 1%.. then it makes more sense to invest your money as you can grow it faster. Its also good to have 3 months salary of emergency fund. But it also feels good completely paying something off so you dont have to continue making interest payments. I dont think there is ever a right or wrong answer.
r3tkiz,hmcoymt,Should I pay off my car?,IceCreamforLunch,11/27/2021,10.0,$70/mo on a $14k balance is a 6% interest rate which is pretty terrible. Set aside at least three months living expenses into a separate high yield savings account and then put the rest toward the car loan.
r3tkiz,r3tkiz,Should I pay off my car?,Curious_Tony,11/27/2021,3.0,Got about 20k In the bank and I’m not sure what to do with it. I owe about 14k on my car so to me it makes sense to pay it off to avoid paying anymore interest. Just wanted to see if smarter people than me would have a reason not to do it.   Thank you for any advice.
r3tkiz,hmcuy2z,Should I pay off my car?,keepngoal,11/27/2021,-2.0,Sell the car buy a less expensive mode of transportation (if you can come out ahead as used cars are hot right now).  Look at e-bikes mass transit.  Cars are expensive by nature and depreciate fast.  Otherwise look to refinance at 1/2 the rate you are currently at.
r3tkiz,hmd2mwd,Should I pay off my car?,thishasntbeeneasy,11/27/2021,3.0,>then it makes more sense to invest your money  This is the best financial advice but worth keeping in mind that this only works if the invested money isnt then spent in the meantime. The average person is very bad at saving and seeing thousands in an account is very likely to make them not worry about spending more on other stuff they may not need.
r3tkiz,hmcoqgt,Should I pay off my car?,Curious_Tony,11/27/2021,1.0,Not sure the interest rate off the top of my head but it’s about 70 extra dollars a month right now. No emergency funds but I would have 4-5k after paying it off. I make decent money and I own my home and my monthly bills are pretty low.
r3tkiz,hmcoh67,Should I pay off my car?,IceCreamforLunch,11/27/2021,3.0,What is the interest rate on the car? Do you also have an emergency fund?
r3tkiz,hmd1w0j,Should I pay off my car?,lightnglass,11/27/2021,2.0,What kind of car do you have (and year)?  How many miles are on the car roughly?  Is the car in nice shape?  Depending on the answers to these questions you may be better off ditching the car at a dealership and getting a cheaper used car a low monthly payment lease etc.    Your interest rate sounds like it is high but check what the interest rate is on the car - that is what matters more than anything.  If your interest is relatively low as others have said you will be better off investing the money in a index fund (can walk you through this if you need it).
r3tkiz,hmcty6w,Should I pay off my car?,Environmental_Put_33,11/27/2021,3.0,Anything above 4% on a car note of that size is worth paying off right away if you have the funds. If the rate is less then put the money into something else that will make you more than 4% which is pretty much most index funds in this bull market.

r3tkm2,hmcru1l,Nightmare with Aspen Dental part 2: scared for my credit?,dante662,11/27/2021,3.0,A regular cleaning is like a hundred bucks.   Youve been robbed. At this point you should call the state regulator.
r3tkm2,r3tkm2,Nightmare with Aspen Dental part 2: scared for my credit?,Rainbow-Death,11/27/2021,5.0,So as I posted before. I had a regular tooth cleaning on 6/18 at aspen. I paid the $1490.  They never filed their insurance paperwork so I have never had my balance refunded.   Aspen sent me another bill the remainder of the bill sans their submitting it to the insurance people. So now I owe an additional $1300 to Aspen. Cigna my insurance doesn’t appear to want to do anything about it.  Is the 1300 additional billing something going should just pay off and take it all down as a very expensive life lesson not to ever use Aspen? I could not pay the additional 1300 but I would just have a bad charge on my finally good credit. Please please give me some good advice.

r3tjvz,hmcrfdf,Guidance on buying new car in 2021,sneaky_fart,11/27/2021,3.0,I ordered a vehicle in October that wont be delivered until February.  I put a $1k deposit down.  This is very normal for special ordered cars.  In this market people are having to do it regularly instead of taking delivery from dealer stock.   its a bit weird at first.  This is very normal.  If you are taking a car from the next delivery to the dealer get the VIN you will receive in writing and the price.   The dealer will 100% have the VIN.   Youre 99.9% likely going to pay MSRP.  Do not pay more than MSRP.  If you are ordering from the factory the VIN wont be available until about 4-6 weeks before the actual build date.  In this case get every option the car will have in writing along with an order number from the factory.  Youll pay MSRP.  Dont pay more.  The other option is that the dealer wants your cash and will try to find a car from another dealer.  Be wary of this.  Dont put a non refundable deposit down and have some kid drive a car from another lot to you.  Its no fun getting a new car with 800 miles on it from 4 states away.  Just ask: where the car is coming from.  What year the car is.  What is the VIN.  What is the binding final price.  If you agree put down a deposit contingent on the answers to your questions being correct.

He’s been on the look out for a rav4 hybrid xle but before he told me to come in on Monday he told me that they are all sold out of all rav4s. (And that’s all within the same conversation.)

Probably not unless your state has dower interest (under which a spouse acquires an automatic interest).   Whatever happened there was more than likely a reason for it.
r3tdr2,r3tdr2,Can a spouse be on a mortgage loan but not on title?,CyberMatrix87,11/27/2021,6.0,Im asking for an older friend. They applied and signed for a joint mortgage refinance yet the house was in his name and not hers in regards to the title. Is that logical legal or was there an error by the mortgage company? They processed it cash-out refinance and already sent the $200K. So I have to imagine its possible legally.  I can easily understand the reverse...youre on the title but not both on the loan. Thats common.   However to be on the loan but not the title? Typically theres a quit claim that would put them both on it. Maybe its just up to the signer (her) whether she wants to assume a home loan with her husband without ownership rights. Takes the risk but none of the reward.  I cant find much research in this regard only the reverse which I said is relatively common for credit problems and such.
r3tdr2,hmcqzz8,Can a spouse be on a mortgage loan but not on title?,DeluxeXL,11/27/2021,6.0,Yea that person is called a co-signer.

r3tfs4,hmcnugt,"If I do a balance transfer on my credit card, does that increase my credit utilization?",AbdominalSandman,11/27/2021,1.0,Yes it does. If it were mine i would call that company and ask for an increase to a max that will make your utilization into something 30% or lower.

r3tfs4,hmconts,"If I do a balance transfer on my credit card, does that increase my credit utilization?",stockcryptowizard,11/27/2021,1.0,The best way is to increase the credit line by calling your credit Card but you may not get it if they already increased it in the last 6 months. You need to offset your balance transfer with an increased credit line or by paying off some Balance on the other card.
r3tfs4,hmcxic1,"If I do a balance transfer on my credit card, does that increase my credit utilization?",Cruian,11/27/2021,1.0,Also depending on timing both cards may report the high utilization for one cycle such as A reporting $3000 and B reporting $3090.
r3tfs4,hmcta2p,"If I do a balance transfer on my credit card, does that increase my credit utilization?",vtlatria,11/27/2021,1.0,This. Your score takes into account your overall revolving utilization not a cards utilization.   If you used the balance transfer to pay off an installment account it *might* negatively affect your score - if you actually transferred another credit card balance it should have no effect.   Reducing interest paid and being able to pay down debt more quickly is worth a temporary hit to your score unless you need to pull your credit for mortgage rental or auto application in the near future.

Before you go phone other dental offices in the area and ask what the going rate is for the  units of time you were in the dental chair. Take this data with you when you go to talk with them.  If necessary negotiate a lower price using the data collected. I would not go ahead and pay the exorbitant price.

You call capital one.

r3ttns,hmd84dc,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,janeusmaximus,11/27/2021,7.0,Yeah can’t really go wrong buying from Costco. Worked at a furniture store for a long time and the only time I felt confident I couldn’t get someone a better deal was when they’d mention Costco. Limited selection but awesome warranty return policy and typically good quality too.
r3ttns,hmd0syu,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,caltheon,11/27/2021,477.0,I got a laptop at a Microcenter recently where they accidently left an old sale tag on it and this was after the chip shortage issue drove up prices of everything.  They honored it with zero issues and didnt try to get me to pay the actual cost so Id say regardless of if it was a mistake or not its shady af for them to try and recoup.
r3ttns,hmd3f2f,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,lenswipe,11/27/2021,41.0,My favorite example of this is when you buy shit at the dollar store and they try to upsell you on a warranty.

r3ttns,hmctbxa,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,Jacuul,11/27/2021,147.0,Warranties are always highly recommended because 99% of the time its just free money for them theres always clauses for them to either not have to actually fix/replace the item or the item just doesnt really break which is the best case scenario but is still just you giving them free money
r3ttns,hmcqpjf,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,dhdave11,11/27/2021,572.0,Had the exact same thing happened to me definitely a tactic to make extra money also pressured me to add insurance.  Went to Costco and found a better sofa for the same amount and no pressure and a great return policy
r3ttns,hmczm3i,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,justLouis,11/27/2021,14.0,Would avoid slimy sales attempt like that and if you plan to make the purchase with a credit card that has purchase protection you wont need a half baked warranty/insurance. Make sure to keep your receipt and other product documentation.

r3sjxk,hmcj2uw,"Am I able to afford a house for my income? How much should I put aside for closing costs? [NY, USA]",Silly_Page_3944,11/27/2021,7.0,That’s crazy. Even with a raise you wouldn’t make enough to afford a $600k house. General rule of thumb is that your mortgage should be 25-30% of your take home pay. You would need low $100k salary
r3sjxk,hmcj56z,"Am I able to afford a house for my income? How much should I put aside for closing costs? [NY, USA]",Phat_with_an_F,11/27/2021,9.0,Short answer? No.  Longer answer? I dont see a bank giving someone making 83k a 500-600k mortgage especially with only 30k down credit card debt and no savings. I get you have investments but thats a bit much of a mortgage payment compared to your salary.  Id look at something that costs much less and save as much as you can for a down payment.
r3sjxk,r3sjxk,"Am I able to afford a house for my income? How much should I put aside for closing costs? [NY, USA]",ironman_101,11/27/2021,1.0,Hey everyone. Sorry if this is long but Im listing our my net worth and income to get a clear understanding of my finances. Im currently living at home to save up so that I can put a down payment on a house. Im looking to move out within a year (2023) and this is definite. Im single and no kids. Im looking at houses in the $500k-$600k range in NY. Ive been at my job for a year. Also I work for a union so I think its relatively secure.  My current income is $67k where I make around $750/week after taxes and this is after deduction from health insurance and 6% towards 401k. Im due for a promotion towards the beginning of 2023 and Im certain its $83k at around $900/week after health insurance & 401k. Yearly raises are typically 5-6%. Currently I have $70k in my stock portfolio. $5k is in a ESPP which becomes available in 6 months. $3.5k is in crypto. About $20k is in a retirement account (401k roth rollover-ira). I dont have any emergency fund but plan on saving up to $5k. I also have $5k in credit card debt which hardly has interest (citi flex 12 month period 0% apr). Other expenses include gym netflix amazon toll gas  food & entertainment which can be like $300/month. I generally have been good not accumulate any debt and pay it off every month. My plan is to save another $30k within the next yr if I am strict and liquate my assets (everything except the emergency/retirement) to pay the down payment. Is this a good idea? Looking at the mortgage calculator it calculates to about $2500-$3000 monthly for the houses. I think once I get my promotion itll be reasonable to pay the mortgage. How much should I expect for closing costs including inspection/real estate? Any other advice is appreciated thank you.

r3sj40,r3sj40,"Fiancé has the higher income, I have the higher credit score. Problem for mortgage?",Shribble18,11/27/2021,3.0,My fiancé (we plan on marrying in the next 30 days) are hoping to buy a house in the next year. He makes about $115k and I make around $65k. My credit score ranges between 790-800 his is 690 on the most recent check. His main issue is he didn’t have a credit card until less than a year ago so his utilization/on time payments are great but he’s dinged for average age of credit. We live in a high COLA and are looking at homes between $400-$700k. We have no children and our only debt is my student loans $9k which I plan to pay off after the interest freeze ends in February.  I’ve read lenders go for the lowest score in a couple applying for a home loan. Is him having a 690 a hindrance or is it a non-issue? Should we wait a year and continue to build his score? He’s also eligible for a VA Home Loan (as am I) which I know tend to get lower interest rates.
r3trm2,hmcqhlo,Saving for a construction loan in an HYSA?,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,1.0,If you want to be sure your money will be there in a year yes. You wouldnt be able to cash out I-Series bonds until theyve been held for a year so you would need to make sure that you purchase them soon if you were planning to go this route.  Short-term CDs may be an option as well but a lot of times they are not competitive with HYSA rates.  Another option might be opening checking accounts for bonuses but they often will tie up your money for a period of time so youd need to be mindful of that as well. Other things to consider would be if you need to keep the account open after the bonus maintaining a particular balance amount to avoid fees etc. I did a bonus offer with Citi that offered $200 with a $5000 deposit (4% ROI) it took about 4.5 months locking up that investment for to get the $5200 into my standard accounts.

r3ttcv,hmcvqui,Capital One App says I’m 1k in debt but don’t know from what,guy_from_the_gif,11/27/2021,2.0,So the debt was there when I first opened my credit card. The reason I found out about the debt was because when I got my credit score summary it said I had it. I don’t know where their credit reporting system is pulling the data that says I have this debt.
r3ttcv,hmctiz1,Capital One App says I’m 1k in debt but don’t know from what,guy_from_the_gif,11/27/2021,3.0,So every time that I get an updated credit score it gives me a summary of what affects my score. The summary says I have 1.3k in debt even when I have my only card (capital one card) paid off
r3sjxk,hmciitc,"Am I able to afford a house for my income? How much should I put aside for closing costs? [NY, USA]",Elegeios,11/27/2021,15.0,Nope. $500k-$600k house by yourself at a current $67k a year is too much and its still too much at $83k a year. Thats 6x your *projected income* and the most people recommend these days is what 3x? Maybe slightly more depending on cost of living?  Could you swing the mortgage payment? If you even got approved for that big a loan yeah maybe you could swing it with your raise barely but youd be dead house poor and thats not even accounting for maintenance wear and tear property taxes etc.  Dont do this.  &#x200B  edit: assuming your math is right at take home theres no chance in hell you can afford this lol. Think about what percentage of takehome would be taken up by housing!
r3tbuy,r3tbuy,Buy Honda Accord before or after relocation to CA?,sli7246,11/27/2021,1.0,Hey all thanks in advance for any helpful advice on the below.   My wife is getting relocated to CA from PA/NJ/NY at the end of January. We currently do not have a car but expect we will need one in CA. Were planning on buying a Honda Accord as a utility reliable starter car. My parents lent me their 13 year old Accord after college which I ended driving up past 200k miles. I feel something special towards the cars.   We were planning on purchasing / ordering an Accord in California. However I called 2 dealerships this morning and the first said they dont take orders (just got to show up in February) and the second promised to call me back and never did. Walked into the dealership in my town and was quoted 30K for a base model (didnt haggle just wanted to see if they had inventory) delivery in December.   My wifes relocation package includes the ability to ship one car to CA at her companys expense. Should we just purchase the car on the East Coast and ship it?  Things I think I know:  \- Will have to pass a smog test (should be fine as a new Honda Accord?)  \- Will need to register in CA so potentially double registration costs if we register first on the East Coast  \- Will need to pay the difference in sales taxes to CA. So wont be able to benefit from the lower sales tax on the East Coast. Our relocation specialist mentioned this trick where you can try to register the car after its East Coast registration expires and potentially pay CA sales post 1 year depreciation. I know technically youre suppose to register within 2 weeks.   \- Buying in December will save me money as I can likely get a 2021 model instead of a 2022 model in February.   Appreciate any thoughts on what Im not thinking about. Thanks!

r3tbuy,hmcnfnx,Buy Honda Accord before or after relocation to CA?,StingrayRaider,11/27/2021,7.0,You can probably get a 2021 in February as well I’d personally wait and buy the car in Ca only because it seems like less work/time at the dmv.  What are tax savings? Anything less then $500 I’d probably wait to buy in Ca unless you need it sooner.
r3t0dm,hmd0xqr,I found an investment account I didn't even know existed,Bort_Bortson,11/27/2021,4.0,Probably along the lines of what others suggested. You were assigned an account for profit sharing or pension but since you left after 18 months most if not all of the money wasnt vested meaning you lost it.  The net benefits and fidelity make sense the previous job I had was with a large cpa firm and the profit share went into an account with almost the same name if not the exact same name but that could be super generic idk. It was treated the same as a 401k match just a lump sum. It also deposited to a default target date fund my first year so future years I had it changed to match what I was investing in out of each paycheck.  From that job 20% of the first years amount was vested increasing 20% till year 6 when everything prior and that year was 100% mine so even though I left Id December I kept the entire amount from the 5 prior years plus 95% of year since it was prorated just a bit but still I made enough time to take it all with me.  So if was similar and your old job followed the same plan you might have been able to keep 20% of whatever they deposited.
r3t0dm,r3t0dm,I found an investment account I didn't even know existed,Ruxinator,11/27/2021,71.0,Over the course of the last week I have taken the liberty of doing a deep dive on this sub. In the spirit of better late than never at the ripe age of 33 I decided to start investing some of the money Ive saved.  I opened a couple Vanguard retirement accounts (Roth IRA & i401k) a high yield savings for my emergency fund and decided to take a very small amount of the money left (1.5%) and open a Fidelity brokerage account to play around with. (Yes I know the risks its an inconsequential amount)  After trying to create an account it said that I already had a Net Benefits account based off of my Name/DOB/Social but that I needed to setup an online account. Weird.  I created an account and during the account creation process the employer info and address was already filled in. This was VERY strange as I dont ever recall opening a Fidelity account.  The info was from a job and address I had in High School about 16 years ago. I worked at a grocery store that was part of a large national chain for about 18 months full time. During this time I had to join a union and pay dues.  My best guess is that I had some unbeknownst contributions to some kind of workplace retirement account that was setup on my behalf by the employer that I likely never thought about and have since completely forgotten about.  The problem is when I try to login to the NetBenefits website I get a Technical Difficulties page as the website is down and has been for a few hours so I am unable to see if an account even exists or what value it may have.  I figure best case scenario I have $13 in there or something. But I am definitely curious what the potential could be.  Anyone have any idea what the account is for?
r3t0dm,hmd7tt6,I found an investment account I didn't even know existed,Chanash,11/27/2021,2.0,If it’s a grocery chain in SoCal then you were very likely part of the SoCal UFCW. If you were there for only 18 months then you wouldn’t have vested for a regular pension (you needed 5 years minimum) and I don’t think they have had any other types of retirement offerings (like the IAP their sister fund up north has/had).   Someone else mentioned that it’s probably something that your employer had setup when you left which I think is most likely.
r3t0dm,hmco3xb,I found an investment account I didn't even know existed,Nutella_Zamboni,11/27/2021,2.0,Pretty cool OP  Im really curious what its value could be.

Unfortunately though there wasnt anything invested... it was just my name/social within their system.

r3t0dm,hmd8aoz,I found an investment account I didn't even know existed,Unoriginal_White_Guy,11/27/2021,2.0,I have good news and bad news. As other have said employers will set up a 401(k) for new employees. A lot of them will have you contribute 1-4% of your pay and match a portion of it. They most likely sent you a letter in the mail about this way back when. The letter will tell you about the plan and investment options. They will have you set up to contribute a certain percent of your income automatically and you have to opt out by mail online or via phone. My thought process is you were contributing and they were matching some amount without you even knowing. The bad news is it most likely wasn’t being invested and sitting in cash. I have a friend that did this. He never set up an account with the plan sponsor(his was vanguard I think) and he just assumed the amount he was contributing was being invested automatically. Nope unless you directed the money it just sits in cash. Regardless congrats you might have found an extra couple hundred to thousand dollars you didn’t know about.
r3swsq,hmcogmo,Debt Consolidation Advice Needed!,SubaWho1337,11/27/2021,1.0,This is true. I see your point for interest being irrelevent depending on speed. Id guesstimate that I can pay an additional $500 or so dollars per month on top of the $1200 due monthly if I really stick to it. However Ive been floating along paying the minimum because its locked in and I really enjoy investing (stocks options crypto) as a hobby which I know arguably the loan being paid off is more important and also yields a 14.99% return guaranteed due to the APR..but...gratification and the market has been so hot this year it would have felt criminal to not put my feet in at least a little bit!
r3t0dm,hmcmbjc,I found an investment account I didn't even know existed,baddad49,11/27/2021,31.0,id guess a 401k or maybe a pension that was started on your behalf...even if you never contributed to it sometimes employers will create these accounts for their employees and contribute profit-sharing into it as i believe there is some tax benefits for the company...they would likely have informed you about this at the time but since it was quite a while ago and you were young at the time its certainly possible that you just werent really paying attention (no offense intended...most teenagers dont pay attention to stuff like this)

r3srj2,hmcxuzw,Preparing to start contributing to a backdoor roth IRA?,cremedelapoo,11/27/2021,1.0,Ya right ok thanks i remember this now
r3srj2,hmcqht5,Preparing to start contributing to a backdoor roth IRA?,passableoven,11/27/2021,1.0,In addition to the other comments here I would read up on the pro rata rule for Roth conversions so you understand why people empty out their traditional iras before doing back doors. https://advancedretirementstrategies.com/what-the-pro-rata-rule-means-for-your-backdoor-roth-ira/
r3srj2,hmcvhjh,Preparing to start contributing to a backdoor roth IRA?,SpecialLlama,11/27/2021,1.0,As others have said you can certainly do a Roth conversion on the full balance of the rollover IRA and pay the taxes on the conversion which may or may not be substantial depending on how much is in the rollover IRA.  I wanted to add one thing.  The Build Back Better bill as passed by the House will take away the option of doing backdoor Roth conversions.  This still has to go through the Senate and this may or may not get changed during that process.  But if it stays you only have until December 31 of this year to contribute after tax dollars to the traditional and do the Roth conversion.  Something to keep an eye on for future reference.
r3srj2,hmcsqfh,Preparing to start contributing to a backdoor roth IRA?,cremedelapoo,11/27/2021,0.0,The tax consequences is only if you want to contribute to your rollover turned traditional IRA right?  What if you open a new tradition ira outside the rollover and isolate your contributions and conversion to only that new account
r3srj2,hmcqmov,Preparing to start contributing to a backdoor roth IRA?,nothlit,11/27/2021,1.0,> My current 401k provider wants Fidelity (thats where my IRA is) to mail ME a check made out to NEW PROVIDER which Ill then send along to the new provider. It just seems kinda weird and not super convenient.  Thats a common way of doing a rollover nothing particularly weird about it.  > Is there any way I could just do a roth conversion on the money already in the traditional IRA to empty out the traditional account?  You can but you will of course have to pay income tax on the amount you convert. Thats what youd be avoiding by rolling it into the 401k instead.
r3t0dm,hmclla6,I found an investment account I didn't even know existed,bushysmalls,11/27/2021,62.0,Try again on Monday fidelity often goes down for maintenance on the weekend in my experience
r3srj2,hmcuw4s,Preparing to start contributing to a backdoor roth IRA?,SpecialLlama,11/27/2021,2.0,No.  All traditional IRAs are considered in aggregate for the pro-rata rule.  Including money in SIMPLE and SEP IRAs.  So even if OP contributes to a new traditional IRA the pro-rata taxation rule will take the rollover IRA money into account if it is not emptied out by either a reverse rollover into OPs 401k or conversion to Roth (and associated taxes paid).
r3swsq,hmcopva,Debt Consolidation Advice Needed!,SubaWho1337,11/27/2021,1.0,in addition to the 8.1% APR - to offer me the loan basically. Well 14.99% over the course of 22 months on a 24k current balance reducing by $1200 a month (assuming minimum) I think about $4500 in interest over 2 years. I think...if I did my math right.
r3swsq,r3swsq,Debt Consolidation Advice Needed!,SubaWho1337,11/27/2021,2.0,Hello. I currently have a loan for the next 22 months at $1217 USD a month to pay off a \~24K loan (14.99% APR) . I also have $4.5k on a credit card (18.99% APR) I just looked into getting a new personal loan at 8.1% APR for $28000. It also has a $2.5k financing charge. My question is - is the lower interest rate worth switching to or does the finance charge make it not worth it? Also in theory I could pay off the credit card debt in one payment from my checking account right now and take out a lower loan but this isnt optimal currently. The monthly payment amount is about the same on the 28k new loan - and that is not an issue. Im just trying to save overall money on interest rate. Is it worth to switch?
r3stdz,r3stdz,What is the MOST I can spend on rent given my circumstances,whyamilikedis21312,11/27/2021,2.0,21 years old credit score 760 with oldest account being 3 years old.    I plan on living with roommates and it’s still super expensive.   I earn minimum wage and my city is insanely expensive. I make $1300 a month.    I have $10000 in savings.    I’ve never had a room in my entire life and slept on a couch in my living room most of my life I absolutely do NOT need money for luxuries. **I am used to the bare minimum** while I know a lot of people have it way worse than me please understand I do not need a lot of money left over for “me” after rent.    Aside from expensive rent my city is generally regarded as one of the most unsafe in America. So yeah finding a “safe” space makes it even more expensive.    MY EXPENSES  I have no car because my city’s transportation system is great $60 a month.   My dad pays my phone bill and gives me $150 every 2 months. I’m sure I can get him to pay for my groceries every few months (he never helped me through my childhood so he tried to help a little now)    **I live in an abusive household and need to gtfo**. What is the biggest percentage I can spend on rent? I know people here say 30% but that’s not realistic in my case and I have some expenses covered by my dad. Plus I do not need a lot of money left over.    I also plan on re enrolling in college in a few months or else I’d be working more hours.
r3stdz,hmcm6vw,What is the MOST I can spend on rent given my circumstances,whyamilikedis21312,11/27/2021,2.0,That makes me so happy 😭 $700-800 is more than possible I could easily find a place for this with a roomate. I also think because I’m so used to low spending my food bill will be way lower than the average person.   I’ll look into other cities because living alone would be awesome especially if I could spend less.
r3stdz,hmcmr45,What is the MOST I can spend on rent given my circumstances,myroommateisgarbage,11/27/2021,1.0,Yes! Again its easier said than done but if you are currently only working a minimum wage customer service (just a guess) job you can find something similar just about anywhere. Its most important that you get out of the abusive household though. Wishing you the best my friend.
r3stdz,hmcjzdt,What is the MOST I can spend on rent given my circumstances,whyamilikedis21312,11/27/2021,2.0,Yeah that’s my plan but unfortunately it’s still super expensive. I 100% could not move out on my own here that would be at least $1100 to not be in a dangerous part of town. I think it’s because my city has a ton of colleges and is being gentrified.
r3stdz,hmcjton,What is the MOST I can spend on rent given my circumstances,myroommateisgarbage,11/27/2021,2.0,Its not ideal but if you can find some roommates you can save a lot on rent.
r3stdz,hmckcom,What is the MOST I can spend on rent given my circumstances,Educational_Lobster6,11/27/2021,3.0,If you budget $700-800/month for rent you will have $500-600 left for other expenses and can supplement that with your savings until you can get yourself a better job. Get out of the bad living situation first and then focus on increasing your wages.
r3stdz,hmcw9fz,What is the MOST I can spend on rent given my circumstances,justLouis,11/27/2021,0.0,Your rent really shouldnt be over 20% your monthly income but that isnt feasible. $520 max if you plan to live alone with roommates on same leasing contract needs to be 2.5x combined monthly income. If you plan to move with a roommate that would greatly increase your odds. https://livehomeroom.com/ has 4 locations if you live in these areas everyone is vetted by the company to rent a room each with a separate leasing contract and affordable. I am not associated or paid by livehomeroom.
r3stdz,hmcktau,What is the MOST I can spend on rent given my circumstances,whyamilikedis21312,11/27/2021,3.0,That would be possible though getting a new job makes me a little wary I realize it may be my only option. How much do you think I can spend on rent if I stay here  given my income and expenses?
r3stdz,hmclxak,What is the MOST I can spend on rent given my circumstances,myroommateisgarbage,11/27/2021,1.0,As another user mentioned you could probably spend $800 comfortably. I also think you could spend considerably less than that if you can find the right situation. However in a different area you could possibly spend that much on an apartment for just yourself which is always preferred.
r3stdz,hmcwrse,What is the MOST I can spend on rent given my circumstances,Educational_Lobster6,11/27/2021,2.0,It really depends on how frugal you are overall and how creative you can be with your meal preparation to keep your food expenditures to a minimum. In theory you could pull another $500 from savings every month for more than a year and a half which would give you $1000/month for living expenses above and beyond your rent.   I would view the savings as a safety net while you get out of your abusive situation but don’t plan to drain the account to $0. You need to find a better paying job to give you more income to work with. If you are in an expensive city as you say more and more retail health aid and food service jobs are paying $15+/hour which isn’t “enough” of course but more than double the minimum wage you are making now.
r3swsq,hmcl4m6,Debt Consolidation Advice Needed!,dendari,11/27/2021,1.0,Is the $2500 finance charge the interest you will pay or an extra fee?  How much interest are you going to for the loans you have currently?
r3stdz,hmckpcr,What is the MOST I can spend on rent given my circumstances,whyamilikedis21312,11/27/2021,3.0,$700-$800 could ** definitley** allow me to move out with a roommate close enough to local colleges too so my overall commute would be tiny. I wasn’t sure if that much rent was realistic given my income do you think it is?   How long do you think my income + $10000 savings would allow me to live in an apartment of this cost? I’d want to stay here for at least the first 2 years of college (I can take out a loan for the last 2)
r3sw00,hmd4pr5,How do I learn to invest?,red5765,11/27/2021,1.0,I definitely wasnt asking these questions at 21 so youre already doing great!  Id say make sure you have enough cash to cover your expenses for at least 3 months.  Then if youre working and your company has a 401(k) with a match then put some money there first.  They usually invest it in a target date fund which is okay to start.  Pay off any debt you have with >7% interest.  Check out the wiki of this page: [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index)  They divide things by age bracket and topic  Finally to answer your question on opening a Roth IRA and investing:  1.

Pay all debt in full if over 3-4% apr interest.  Max out your employer 401k if they offer a matching % or if you want to be in a lower tax bracket since this contribution will lower your tax liability.  Open a Roth IRA and max out that 6k limit yearly.  Checkout Vanguard or SoFi to open your Roth IRA and setup auto deposit :)
r3sw00,hmcklty,How do I learn to invest?,SubaWho1337,11/27/2021,2.0,Hey buddy my first suggestion is start watching a few people on youtube. They can kind of get you started. I would suggest taking the information and then doing your own research to make sure its sound because it will include opinions and potential beneficial directions for them in there. Andrei Jikh is a great channel and so is Graham Stephen. They are pretty down to earth and fact based and relatively unbiased. usually the standard ideas are 401K from employer or roth 401k = to what the company matches because it is free money. Beyond that next steps are build an emergency fund = 6 to 12 months of your monthly expenses as savings in case anything bad happens. And finally max out a Roth IRA. This info should give you a good starting point :). Best of luck!

Keep your mind open.  Dont block every post article data provider just because they go against your bias.

Investopedia  If someone tries to sell you their trading method strategy plan etc its bs. If it worked they wouldnt be trying to sell it to you.  People get into investing/speculating/betting get a lucky run and decide they know everything then lose it all...  If your trading dont YOLO everything on one trade. If your account is like $100 or something you may have to and thats fine I suppose but try to diversify.  Buying the S&P and doing nothing else is a valid yet boring path to take.
r3swsq,hmcsn0q,Debt Consolidation Advice Needed!,dendari,11/27/2021,2.0,That fee is way too high.a personal loan to cut interest rates isnt generally a great idea but if you arent going to rack up more debt it can be a good way to cut the amount of interest you pay( with a minor hit to you credit score).  If you want to do this you should be able to find a personal loan without any fee.
r3swsq,hmcnd64,Debt Consolidation Advice Needed!,colterlovette,11/27/2021,1.0,Interest is somewhat irrelevant if you can pay it off faster (I.e. just start throwing cash at the balances as fast as you can).   In my experiences consolidation loans are typically a PIA have terrible interest rates themselves and leave a nice dark mark on the credit history for any future underwriting agent.   Some may have differing opinions but unless a typical retail bank is willing to lend you a personal line you’re better off trimming the budget to the bones and getting these paid off asap.   The exception to this is if you have some asset of value you can loan against.   Most likely: buckle down get it paid off.
r3swsq,hmcr62t,Debt Consolidation Advice Needed!,colterlovette,11/27/2021,1.0,So to be blunt:  Unless your returning above 20% on the cash your using in the market you’re at a significant net loss because you aren’t actually investing money you own.   Unless you have liquid cash sitting around that amounts to above the total of what you have in debt every dollar you have is not actually yours.   You’re technically taking someone else’s money and playing with it. On top of that you’re paying them to do that. So for simplicity every dollar you put into the market you’ve actually spent $1.20 meaning right out the gate if you’re not guarantee returning at least $1.20 you’re just lighting money on fire that you don’t have.   In the end the best way to get out of debt (in my mind) and stay out is to remind yourself that debt is simply other peoples money that you then trade future time and effort to return. So all the paychecks you make right now… all the hours of your life you spend to get it.. it’s not actually yours. You spent it awhile ago and now it’s debt.

For the sake of simplicity: Currently have a house in Texas that was bought for $300k and valued at about $500k right now. If I come across a house that sells for $500k but they won’t accept selling my current home first as a contingency (the $200k or so which I would use towards the 20% on the new loan) can I get the loan I’m approved for in the amount of the home with no contingency sell my house after getting the new house and then place the 20% down on the loan will that get rid of the PMI?

Then you can see what this population of select individuals agrees on.  Free services?  TipRanks basic but it is overly limiting. For better results: 1. Marketwatch  2. Seeking Alpha 3. Barchart.com  Note - most all of these have premium plans too but I havent found as useful as TipRanks.

r3t6z3,hmconka,Put 20% toward mortgage after buying the house to avoid PMI?,michaelcheck12,11/27/2021,1.0,So I was able to drop my PMI a few years back. You can pay extra to begin with but I recommend something else.  What I did was to take advantage of the growth in value of my house/land over a few years while paying extra on the principal. I was able to also invest extra money I had.  When I talked to the bank about dropping the PMI because I made a reasonable estimate that a new appraisal would show that the house/land was worth more than it was when I purchased it they required an appraisal.  I paid for the appraisal couple hundred bucks and it came out higher than I expected. I spent less money in additional principal payments because of this. Also because I wasnt only focusing on paying down the principal I was able to invest a lot in my retirement account as well.

My credit score is 760 I have very little debt. Banks won’t loan me for a house. They say it’s hard to loan people on 1099 work. I know people who make way less money than me and have way higher debt. They still get approved for mortgages. Should I just say fuck it and wait a few years and buy a house out right
r3t26h,hmdaayi,Bank won’t loan me for a mortgage,Honeycombhome,11/27/2021,3.0,Definitely talk to more loan officers but just FYI that putting yourself on W-2 thing may not work. I’ve been on W2 for my company for years but loan officers have told me that if I own the company they still need to see consistent company profits bc of Covid loan regulations (not sure how many loan companies have this policy).

r3t26h,hmcttih,Bank won’t loan me for a mortgage,toastybage1,11/27/2021,14.0,Underrated comment. I work for a credit union in the mortgage department. We do tons of mortgages for self employed folks who are making far less than OP.
r3t26h,hmd2onm,Bank won’t loan me for a mortgage,itsworththewhile,11/27/2021,3.0,Honestly this should be the first place anyone looking for a mortgage goes. Usually better rates and more personal service.
r3t26h,hmd241c,Bank won’t loan me for a mortgage,itsworththewhile,11/27/2021,1.0,Do you have at least 2 years of bank statements to show them for this 1099 income? Because if not Im assuming thats your problem.

Not sure on the details of that arrangement but it seemed to work for them when they where just kicking off.  Your 1099 income isnt good enough but since youve incorporated and pay yourself out from that same income now youre qualified!   Play the game people. Play the game.
r3t26h,hmcpr6q,Bank won’t loan me for a mortgage,BastidChimp,11/27/2021,1.0,Dont worry. Just keep investing in the stock market. There are foreclosures on the rise in some states.

r3t6z3,hmcns6e,Put 20% toward mortgage after buying the house to avoid PMI?,beetle1736,11/27/2021,6.0,My understanding is that you can put money towards it at any point in the life of the loan and once you get to that 80% loan to value mark done with PMI just call bank to make sure that insurance policy gets cancelled.    separate circumstance but related-  wife and I just refinanced to get better rates and cut life of loan refinance required an appraisal.  In our case appraisal came in quite a bit higher than when we bought house a few years ago.  So in our case were getting rid of the PMI by way of increased property value vs putting money down.
r3t26h,hmcldkb,Bank won’t loan me for a mortgage,Valendorf,11/27/2021,3.0,Usually you need multiple years of tax returns showing a stable income at the rate you are at and other supporting documentation to prove that your income isn’t going to change drastically in the short term.  Most banks don’t want to deal with the extra effort.
r3t26h,hmd3zkb,Bank won’t loan me for a mortgage,vynm2,11/27/2021,8.0,Becoming an S-corp so you can put yourself on payroll so you can get a W-2 doesnt necessarily change the equation. If youre the primary shareholder they still treat you as self-employed and will want all sort of extra documentation like S-Corp tax returns Profit and Loss statements etc from the S-Corp.   Its not significantly easier to get approved than if youre a sole-proprietor.

r3t26h,hmcqoo9,Bank won’t loan me for a mortgage,Dark-Jedi-Lobster,11/27/2021,1.0,I was advised by my credit union that Id need 2 years worth of 1099 work for a mortgage. Also its the main reason I now ask employers going forward if Im 1099 or W2.      I vote wait a few years and buy it outright - by then the houses might be a little cheaper.
r3t26h,hmcm3tv,Bank won’t loan me for a mortgage,colterlovette,11/27/2021,25.0,Ya… welcome to financing in sole proprietorship (or any self employment scenario).   You have to build ~3 years of tax returns showing your income they then average them to get your qualifying income (at least that’s how it was for me). They do this to make sure they’re lending on a steady income stream and not one that just had a good year.  Also prepare for significant down payment requirements no matter your score. :/  I have a few buddies that put themselves on payroll within their companies just to have reportable W2 income to avoid this. Not sure on the details of that arrangement but it seemed to work for them when they where just kicking off.

r3t26h,hmcle4e,Bank won’t loan me for a mortgage,Iammine843,11/27/2021,1.0,I thought because of the banking regs a 1099 needed to show 3 years of income with tax returns or something.  Have you tried SoFi or a mortage broker?  Its doable just more paperwork for you and possibly more money down than a traditional mortgage.
r3srj2,hmcop24,Preparing to start contributing to a backdoor roth IRA?,Rxew,11/27/2021,2.0,If you can pay the taxes on whatever balance is in your IRA out of pocket then go for it.  If not - best to roll it into your 401k first.
r3srj2,r3srj2,Preparing to start contributing to a backdoor roth IRA?,besthouse,11/27/2021,2.0,My understanding is that before I contribute to a traditional IRA in order to convert it to a Roth I need to zero out my existing rollover IRA. I rolled a 401k into a traditional IRA a few years ago and havent contributed to that rollover IRA since. I know one option is todo a reverse rollover from my IRA into my current employer 401k but it seems complicated. My current 401k provider wants Fidelity (thats where my IRA is) to mail ME a check made out to NEW PROVIDER which Ill then send along to the new provider. It just seems kinda weird and not super convenient. Is there any way I could just do a roth conversion on the money already in the traditional IRA to empty out the traditional account? I havent seen that mentioned anywhere so maybe thats not an option but figured one of you fine folks might know!  EDIT: thanks for the responses! Good to know that this is standard for rollovers. I don’t have a ton of money in this IRA but I think I’ll still be better off doing the rollover into my 401k than converting it to a roth
r3srj2,hmcjuf4,Preparing to start contributing to a backdoor roth IRA?,boolda,11/27/2021,1.0,Yes. You convert your ira into Roth. But it might have tremendous tax consequences.

r3ttns,r3ttns,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,Anton-LaVey,11/27/2021,549.0,Went to buy a high-end sofa today. Retailer had a Black Friday deal for “30% off”. Deal price of $3290 was in the price tag insert attached to the floor model (though the “reg” price was $500 more than was listed as the reg on last month’s “no sales tax” deal while the “deal” price was conveniently only $70 less than the previous deal price 🙄). Got a delivery quote from the salesman and agreed to the purchase (at the deal price on the tag insert). He ran my credit card for it (price + tax + delivery) and went to complete the paperwork. Then he came back and told me the floor model price tag had the wrong insert the price with the options it had was actually $200 more.   I told him I was only willing to pay the agreed upon price and he went to “make a phone call” and came back saying it’s not my fault their “incompetent” staff misadvertised the price and they would sell it to me at the original deal price discussed.   My question is was this just a cash grab for an extra $200? Would that have gone to the company or the employee (they were def commission based)? Or is there some deeper reason like making me feel I got one over on them for paying $200 less that the “real” sticker? Cause all it did was leave a bad taste in my mouth.

Most credit card companies are getting in on the buy now pay later schemes like afterpay and affirm but integrated into their credit card statement for individual purchases.  Chase has My Plan and Amex has Plan It..and most of them are offering 0% fee till end of the year. I just bought a new house and almost all my purchases have gone on my amex with 24 month plan setup. I get great amex support and amex points which are much more useful to me.    They even run promotion lower rates. Basically its prepaid interest.

In august i got a bill from my electric company that they had gotten a actual reading (it has been estimated for two years according to that bill) and said i owed $800. I called them and they said they sent my complaint to the back office to be resolved and just pay the usage on bills and they would freeze the account so i wouldnt get my power and gas shutoff. Now its a couple months later and i get a notice that my power and gas will be shutoff on 12/02 if i dont pay. I called again and they said they sent my problem to the back office again. I was worried it was the same thing as last time so i called the next day and asked for a supervisor after a hold the guy i talked to said it was more complicated than they thought and someone would call me immediately. This was Wednesday before thanksgiving so the office is closed until monday but im running out of time. What do i do? Should I just pay it and be done? Or can i get it fixed or at least reduced in some way? So far theyve only sent me a payment plan offer but thats no help.

r3u7rs,hmczrks,What percentage of savings should be retirement vs taxable?,duelistjp,11/27/2021,4.0,if you are able to enjoy life without too much hardship at your current expense level id say not too worry.  now if you are living off cat food scrimping and saving to put 90% of your money into investment accounts you need to live a bit.  unless you have huge expenses planned their is no real need as long as you have a healthy emergency fund to not put money in tax advantaged accounts.  so basically unless you are buying a home or putting people through college you are probably fine staying the course

Save an extra 70% over what you need for your emergency fund in a taxable investment and put your entire emergency fund in an index fund?  Why 70%? The most an index fund has dropped is 59%. That means worse case if your investments drop 59% (1/.59 == .70) you still have your emergency fund and statistically you’ll come out ahead.

r3u7rs,hmd80b4,What percentage of savings should be retirement vs taxable?,Nagisan,11/27/2021,3.0,Generally speaking emergency funds are most necessary for someone who doesnt have access to a whole lot of money on a moments notice.    Once you save up enough in retirement accounts and/or a brokerage youre almost always better off dropping the emergency fund and using those accounts for that purpose. The only emergency this turns out bad for is a huge market drop because while you may still have access to say $10k from an investment account the $10k you had in a HYSA (or i-bonds) didnt lose value and actually increase in value as a result.    So a $17k brokerage would drop in value (to $10k) whereas a $10k HYSA would rise in value and be worth $10k in the crashed market (which is more valuable than the pre-market crash).    Though for literally every other emergency the brokerage is typically a better option once you have enough in it.

r3txb0,hmcxmr0,Opinions on my rent budget in NYC,Bryan995,11/27/2021,3.0,Then do it!  I wish I had stretched a bit more when buying a home.

My gross is 310K and was looking at nice desirable neighborhoods in Manhattan. I really like Greenwich and West Village. Currently thinking about a 1 bed for $4500 per month (planning to host my out of town family often). I’ve been frugal my entire life and would like to splurge for once and experience living in a nice apartment in a great neighborhood in NYC.  Post tax I’ll be making about $168K. I still plan to save around 45%-50% of my take home pay so around $80K. Have about $250K in savings no debt and plan is to FIRE as soon as I can.  I know I can afford the rent but it just feels too much to spend just on rent. But on the other hand I’d like to splurge and not regret missing out on experiences while I’m relatively young.   Any thoughts or opinions on this?

r3rq09,hmcgkvn,"Didnt get a meter reading when i closed on my house, now electric company wants me to pay 800$ for previous owners usage",TwoWrongsAreSoRight,11/27/2021,33.0,First look at your state laws and your closing documents to ensure nothing has snuck in or theres no loopholes.  The public utilities commission and whoever helped you close on your house should be able to help with this.  Truth is it will be less of a hassle to consider paying it temporarily as if they shut you off you will need to pay anyway + fees in the event you are found responsible for the bill.  However dont accept phone calls as proof of the bill and dont pay with a credit card.  Everything should be done by mail and check so there is an unbroken paper trail in the event this does reach a legal action stage.   Get the customer service phone number from the utilities website (or a state registry) call and inform them that your first day owning the property was Feb X 2021 and ask for a mailing address to overnight them proof if they are willing to accept it.  Ask them to mail you a bill from that date forward.       If they arent willing to give that to you your city/state should have a public utilities commission.  They should be your next call.  I assume you can provide proof of your first day owning the home.  Depending on the laws of your state and the terms of your closing that should be all they are allowed to charge.  If the public utilities commission isnt willing to help then its time to get the state attorney generals office involved and possibly seek out a lawyer.  This will be a long process if you have the utility company wont cooperate.  Good Luck

Being that she doesn’t have an employer with a 401k offering/match what types of investing accounts should she open and what are the associated contribution limits?  She has spent the last few years getting her business off the ground and has about 50k annually to invest.

r3rq09,hmcryvv,"Didnt get a meter reading when i closed on my house, now electric company wants me to pay 800$ for previous owners usage",aflawinlogic,11/27/2021,-1.0,You are completely wrong. A property can totally owe.  Its his problem because utility bills are often not charged to person but to the property and can be enforced with liens against that property so lesson learned always get final reads when transferring ownership and buyer beware from foreclosure sales.  Renter payment authorization is also an easy common thing but its always going to revert back to the current owner in case of non-payment.  The company doesnt know or care that a sale has occurred it isnt their problem they are still gonna collect.
r3u6gl,hmd4q38,If I have to move would I be able to rent out my house or would some types of loans require me to sell the house?,RandomlyJim,11/27/2021,1.0, In the United States most first time homebuyer programs ran through the Agencies of Fannie Freddie and FHA do not have a minimum length of time for you to live in the home.   You have to move in within 60 days but the loan program doesn’t require a minimum time frame.  State city and local down payment assistance programs may have different requirements including time of primary status but that is entirely specific to your state county and city.  If you ever sell the home you may have to pay Capital Gains tax rate unless you spent a minimum amount of time in it.     TLDR: 2 years will cover you for taxes.  60 days will cover you for first time program.  Down payment programs **may** require something extra.

r3u6gl,hmd897k,If I have to move would I be able to rent out my house or would some types of loans require me to sell the house?,Bostonosaurus,11/27/2021,2.0,Ive never heard of converting to a different loan. I think your primary residence mortgage typically states that you move in within 30-60 days of closing and live there for at least 12 months.  It may be in your advantage to live there for 24 months. That way if you sell within the subsequent 36 months (60 months from your move-in) you get a huge tax advantage if it increases in value and you decide to sell.  Ive asked similar questions to yours in the past and I didnt get much of an answer to: 1) Can I hold two mortgages at the same time? Are the terms similar? 2) Does rental income count in my debt to income ratio when getting the 2nd house (my new primary residence).  Im guessing holding two mortgages may be the biggest challenge to this plan but not knowing income and house costs its hard to say. If you make $1000000/yr have no debts and the houses are each 100k youll be fine. Beyond that Im not sure what numbers work as you already mentioned its kinda hard to Google. I DO believe that you will be required to have more money in cash assets when getting the 2nd mortgage in case the rental property is vacant.

Which way I described it renting or being required to sell it? I am planning on living in whatever home I buy for the rest of my 6+ years in the graduate program. If something happens that would require me to move (ex: if my PI moves to a different university I would have to go with him for all but the last 2 years of the program) would I be able to convert it to a different type of loan so Im not accidentally committing fraud or would I be forced to sell it / pay for housing in the new city plus a mortgage in an empty house?
r3u6gl,hmd0hg4,If I have to move would I be able to rent out my house or would some types of loans require me to sell the house?,DiabolicalLife,11/27/2021,5.0,I purchased a home in 2007 and ended up getting a new job 8 months later moving out of state.  Thats right when the market started to drop so (at the time) selling would have been a loss.  Ended up renting out the house.  Mortgage company didnt care as long as the payments were current.  Property tax did care as its a difference tax rate.   Note being a landlord is not easy.  I recommend finding a (good) 3rd party company that will take care of all lease agreements and 3am phone calls. Its worth the money. Especially if you are not near by to keep an eye on things.
r3u6gl,r3u6gl,If I have to move would I be able to rent out my house or would some types of loans require me to sell the house?,3dprintingn00b,11/27/2021,16.0,*Background*: Im a student in a long graduate program and Im looking into buying a house or condo because I will be in my (low cost of living) city for at least the next 6 years followed by a period of 3-7 years where I will have little input on where I am allowed to live (essentially wherever I am matched I will be required to work there). Ive tried looking this up online but I havent had much luck. Ive read that some mortgages have better rates if youre planning to live in the house rather than use it as an investment property.  *My question is:* if I apply for a home loan with the intention of living in it during my graduate program but then Im required to move to a different city would I be able to rent the property out (and supposedly it would convert to a different type of loan) or would some loan types require me to sell the property?

r3u6gl,hmd130v,If I have to move would I be able to rent out my house or would some types of loans require me to sell the house?,Realistic_Honey7081,11/27/2021,1.0,Cool soooo.   Shop around for a mortgage locally check out local credit unions.   After a lot of hunting for perfect ears and calling like 50 places I found one in my area that offered exactly what I wanted for how much and at what rate.  Now. Do you qualify for a mortgage? Do you have income that a loan company would consider for your repayment ability? For example when I was in college I received a stipend from the VA for the GI bill of $1300 a month. This in addition to my part time job allowed me to sit pretty comfy. Back in 2015ish I attempted to use these income streams to buy a home. At the end of the day and a lot of stress my income wasn’t considered valid for the purposes of doing a home loan it would have been fine had I had a co-signer but I was not blessed with such a network.  So that’s firstly. Secondly.  You can have multiple home loans. You don’t refinance when you buy a new one. Each loan is with a different company. Some loan products are backed by the federal government removing risk for the lender if you default. These loan types have a certain cap on how much you can have in total for an outstanding balance and still be able to qualify for the more financially beneficial product.   Generally your plan is golden. When you move you can sell it. Rent it. Or leverage it and rent it.   Selling it or leveraging it can help bank roll your next home. But your a long way away from the decision so it doesn’t matter.  Hit up a bank that’s open tomorrow and ask about home loans. A loan salesman would be happy to talk to you because they make commission.
r3rq09,hmcdsid,"Didnt get a meter reading when i closed on my house, now electric company wants me to pay 800$ for previous owners usage",jellicle,11/27/2021,289.0,As part of the sale you would typically request a utility certificate a statement from the utility that the payments are up to date. Was that done? Because as the buyer you want to buy the house without buying surprise obligations. If a lawyer was involved thats what youre paying the lawyer for. Or title insurance same thing.  Your problem is surprisingly complex and can be approached a lot of ways. Argue with utility including talking to ombudsmans office if it exists. Contact your lawyer. Contact your title insurance. Contact the previous owner.  Whatever part of the bill happened after you took ownership is yours. The other part is the previous owners although it might be put on the utility or on your title insurance or your lawyers practice insurance etc. Ask the utility to give you an estimate of how much was incurred before and after you took ownership.

Here it is 38 F but it will vary from state to state.    Depending on where you live there can still be plenty of cut off days.  The inside meter readings might just be estimates generated by the computer billing system.     Or the inside meter readings might be self reads where the customer reads their own meter and sends it in.  If that is the case then the prior owner might have been purposely under reading it to have lower bills.  We used to have that here but we switched to all remote read meters and it solved a lot of these problems.    It should not take months to figure it out.   This is something that can be computed in something like 10 minutes manually.

If the card has a limit I dont think this would allow you to get around the limit. After having the card for a while you can apply to have the limit raised.

After i closed on the house the guys from the water department got the water turned on and smelled the leak so they called nyseg guy for me to come fix it. So my guess its been a tiny leak going on for at minimum a month before i bought the house but at most could be at the last reading date listed on my bill which was 2019

They can’t prove the usage is yours in order to levy the charges. While sure you taking a picture would have made the logistics to resolution easier here it’d also be you doing their job.   I’d be calling them up daily and possibly including the state utility regulator consumer complaints office if I didn’t get it cleared up within a few days.  *edit* To clarify this is all data. Start date end date rate etc. if any of those parameters fall outside the time stamp on account creation they made a boo-boo and it’s on them to clear it up.

r3udw5,hmd8jdm,How can I create a negative balance on my credit card?,yoyogogo111,11/27/2021,2.0,If you hold a negative balance for long enough (by paying a bill then returning an item for example as others have described) the cc company will often just send you a check for the balance so they’re no longer carrying that liability on their books. Usually 3-6 months depending on the company. So even if you manage to do this (which is probably not the best idea as others have pointed out but not necessarily actively harmful) be aware of that time limit.

They switch accounts all the time and sometimes even let you enter the meter online and be verified a few days later when they have a meter reader in the area. If there was a gas company tech on-site for a leak they probably recorded the meter on their paperwork as well. I think you might owe the 800.
r3rq09,hmd1s38,"Didnt get a meter reading when i closed on my house, now electric company wants me to pay 800$ for previous owners usage",inkseep1,11/27/2021,1.0,Since the prior owner had estimated readings that were never adjusted with an actual reading it will take some time to sort it out.  But they will.  There will be a way that they do this that is permitted within the regulations.   No one will be 100% sure that you get charged correctly for your usage down to the dollar but it should be close enough.  Probably what they will do is just prorate the unbilled usage for the time you owned it.  If it is a good system they will figure it based on the season and the average heating / cooling degree days over that time.  I guarantee that they have done this before.    Dont pay the bill yet.  At least here and I would assume other places the investigation will halt the shut off.   They cant shut off everyone because they dont have enough employees.  Cut offs are done on a scoring system involving amount owed the length of time that you are behind on payments new usage and other things.  If you just now got a notice you are probably still scoring low in the routing system that sends the field crew out.  They are not ever going to tell you that because the threat of cut off is supposed to make you pay.   And the investigation should automatically halt the routing.  That is how I designed ours to work.    However utility payment reports might affect your credit rating.  So if you do pay it simply request a refund.   Or you can also call them and complain that not paying should not appear as a negative on their reports.     Do you know what utility companies hate the most?   Customer calls.  The call center costs money and does not generate any revenue.   Probably the second most hated thing is Public Service Commission complaints.  File one of them and they will have to provide the PSC tedious documents to resolve it.    But give it most of a billing cycle for them to sort it out.

r3wrdb,r3wrdb,Credit limit increased and it's a problem,siskulous,11/27/2021,1.0,So a little background. My credit resting is just shy of 600. Not horrible but bad. (It was 450 a few years ago after my divorce so you know progress.) Anyway I got a secured credit card with a limit of $200 and have been using it mostly for fuel and paying it off every month for a couple years. Today I got an email congratulating me on begging a good customer and informing me that my deposit was being returned and my credit limit was being raised to $1000.  Now heres the problem with this: if I have money I spend it. Part of it is impulse control issues related to uncontrolled ADD (the only medication that ever worked for me stopped working due to built up resistance around 30 years ago) and part of it is just bad habits. I intentionally got a card with a limit low enough that paying it off would never be more than a minor inconvenience because of this but now Im looking at the possibility that when not if (I know me) my self control slips Ill be in for a grand plus interest deeper than I can easily manage.   What should I do? I want the card because it is helping me get my good credit back but I did not want that much credit card debt.  Edit: Everyone is saying deal the company and ask them to reduce the limit. Honestly thats such an obvious answer that now I feel silly for not doing that as soon as I got the email. Thank you everyone Ill call them in the morning (its after midnight here now.)

r3txb0,hmczgis,Opinions on my rent budget in NYC,doebogan,11/27/2021,2.0,Yes I’ve made up my mind! Gonna do it. Difficult to think rationally when I’ve been frugal my entire life :). Thank you for sharing your experience!
r3sj40,hmcjqw0,"Fiancé has the higher income, I have the higher credit score. Problem for mortgage?",Frozenlazer,11/27/2021,1.0,Since youll need both incomes to qualify for a loan as big as you are talking its kinda a moot point unless you want to wait and work on his score.  However you might find that the difference in actual costs on your loan arent that huge. Youll just have to talk some lenders and see .
r3sj40,hmcpowp,"Fiancé has the higher income, I have the higher credit score. Problem for mortgage?",Fun_Personality1201,11/27/2021,2.0,Lenders take the mid score out of your 3 scores. They don’t take the high score not the low. The one in the middle. If there are two borrowers. They will use the lower of the two applicants “Mid scores”. Also to make matters more confusing a mortgage enhanced credit report/pull is usually different than what you will see as a consumer as your score.
r3sj40,hmd7ish,"Fiancé has the higher income, I have the higher credit score. Problem for mortgage?",Shribble18,11/27/2021,1.0,Yeah I added him as an AU to all of my cards and he currently has a secured line card in his name only. I’ll be sure we keep paying early. I use to make small payments throughout the month but I’ve been getting lax.
r3ge29,hmcnazk,Is marriage expensive?,itsadesertplant,11/27/2021,1.0,I definitely recommend a password manager and a shared email for bills if you get married. I don’t know much about how finances themselves change- I’m not married- but I do know that it’s easier to get on one another’s health insurance if it’s provided by an employer.   I personally wouldn’t advocate for a joint account. Separate finances. If one party needs extra money/is doing the grocery shopping for both of you etc that person can have a particular credit card for that purpose or can have a specific amount transferred to them on a regular basis to a certain account and so on. You can split bills by having each of you pay certain ones.  However I think it’s ok to share an email account that is only for the bills (the email is linked to accounts for insurance electric internet etc) so either party can log in and see what’s going on. Having a joint account is one thing but communicating with each other about finances is another very important thing imo.   Having an email that both of us can access has helped me and my partner keep track of things while having our own bank accounts. We also have the Bitwarden open-source password manager which allows for sharing particular passwords without texting or handwriting it which is nice for dealing with numerous online bill pay services.
r3sj40,hmcmaif,"Fiancé has the higher income, I have the higher credit score. Problem for mortgage?",Peachesornot,11/27/2021,1.0,You are going to be fine with a 690 credit score. It shouldnt be an issue in getting approved. If for some reason his median score was below 660 I would be more worried about it. The only downside is that you might have slightly higher rates.
r3sj40,hmcvdcu,"Fiancé has the higher income, I have the higher credit score. Problem for mortgage?",SlowlyTowardsTheCake,11/27/2021,3.0,Just went through this in the same situation. My salary is high credit is good (700ish). Wife’s salary is $0 (SAHM) and her credit is 800+. The catch for us was that we went through a credit union and had more than 20% down so we didn’t need PMI and thus the CU didn’t have to adhere to federal guidelines in approving us since they would hold the mortgage until payoff (it won’t be sold). In our case they used my wife’s score in determining approval
r3sj40,hmcl38p,"Fiancé has the higher income, I have the higher credit score. Problem for mortgage?",ahj3939,11/27/2021,6.0,Add him as authorized user to your oldest non-Amex card.  Also make sure to keep reported credit card balances super low. For the best possible scores you want one card to report a small balance say $5 and the rest $0. Credit scores dont care if you pay in full every month because most banks only report statement balance once a month. So you want to pay early to have a lower balance reported.  1 year old credit card should give higher than 690 score if reported balance is kept low. Ignore any of that nonsense you hear about 30% utilization at that point it really starts to impact your scores especially the older FICO versions used for mortgages. When I let 1 card report about 20% balance it drops a good 30 points and I dont have to counteract short credit history.  Read these:  https://creditboards.com/forums/index.php?/topic/574263-the-everything-about-mortgage-fico-scores-thread/  https://creditboards.com/forums/index.php?/topic/544017-the-master-2-reporting-trick-explained/  Also see if any of your cards do credit limit increase without hard pull. If so run down the list and ask for one. For the ones that ask for amount aim high ask for at least 50% more or even double. https://www.doctorofcredit.com/credit-cards/which-credit-card-companies-do-a-hard-pull-for-a-credit-limit-increase/  High credit limit lets you keep credit utilization low without having to watch the balance too closely. Of course for a mortgage it helps to watch it a little and make sure you have several reporting $0 and the ones that do below 10%.
r3sh25,hmcz49j,Need help dealing with grandmas finances..,not-now-im-redditing,11/27/2021,1.0,You need to get a full picture of your grandma’s assets and liabilities and income. That’s the starting point. You also need to obtain a copy of her husbands will and a list of assets that were co-owned including joint bank accounts.  You can pull your grandma’s credit report to get a starting point for identifying her debts.   It’s a lot of work but it’s doable once you are organized.  I don’t know anything about social security benefits for elderly widows. The pension may include a survivorship option that if elected may cover your grandma. It varies from pension to pension but the idea is that an individual gives up a small portion of their pension in exchange for surviving spouse benefit. You can probably call the company handling the pension and ask them about generalities if they won’t talk specially about your grandma. The name is probably included on a statement.
r3sh25,r3sh25,Need help dealing with grandmas finances..,matto_2008,11/27/2021,1.0,My grandmothers husband passed today and with her and my mothers (as well as her siblings) inability to manage money/be supportive well I’ve been asked to step in as set up a plan.  I’m looking for any advice into helping an elder family member who is not well off.  Known details below  I know that grandma has had purchasing issues before but I do not know the extent of her debt if there is any.  I know that her husband (step-grandfather?) has a pension she should receive from his time as a police officer.  I believe she is receiving social security but I do know she will be losing his SSI.  He did not have life insurance and many of the assets have been taken by various family members.  Is there anything I can do to help set up my grandma to live as comfortable as possible but also in a fashion she cannot waste the assets she has left. Is there any information I need to gather to help in this process. Any guidance/experience is much appreciated.

r3ttns,hmdbriv,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,the_jud,11/27/2021,9.0,Its possible that hes playing a tactic but more reasonably they probably did actually mess up. The commission difference with $200 up charge is very small and not worth the risk of losing a sale. Companies are very messy and probably didnt have their crap in order especially on the most hectic day of the year in their industry.  In reality he probably felt awkward having to come back to you about the wrong price after you were already sold and had to do it because he wasnt authorized to sell for lower than that list price the company set. That probably explains why he awkwardly tried to justify the inconvenience off an incompetent colleague. He was feeling uncomfortable -- no one likes conflict.

I do a percentage of each and all the money is in the same account - but it keeps track of how much is pre- and how much is post-.  My employers contributions go to a 401(a) account so that one is separate.

Its basically indistinguishable from the 401(k)s Ive had at previous companies. My money goes to Fidelity and I have \~35 funds to choose from to invest in. I can move between funds freely. I can take a loan against it or a hardship withdrawal (although Ive never had reason to do either) just like a 401(k).

A non profit can choose to sponsor a 401k but are not required to.  Depending on the plan design these were required to be separate plans. Merging the two is not optional one plan Would have to terminate and allow employees to cash out. Most employers who started with separate plans retain them as the termination doesnt guarantee theyll keep all the assets.

The money the staff contributes goes into a 403b and the 3% the company contributes goes into a 401k account.  Both accounts offer the same investing choices.

Theyre 2 completely separate plans. They do share a limit though. Employee contributions cant be over $19500 for 2021 across both plans.   Not clear why they have 2 but it may be because 403b plans are exempt from discrimination testing and 401k plans are not.

It sounds like they have a safe harbor 401k they (have to) contribute to. Then they offer a 403b as well with no company contribution. Not exactly sure why itd be structured this way but could have happened as a result of a merger or something.
r3ttns,hmd8qx6,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,janeusmaximus,11/27/2021,4.0,100% they should have just let ‘em purchase it for tagged price even if it was mislabeled. Gotta say working at a furniture store for many years very possible it was actually mislabeled. If it was mislabeled it is possible the employee actually made less commission than they would have made. For example I made 5% commission on most sales but anything sold for less than a certain profit margin I’d make 2.5%. I would never have mentioned it to a customer but this salesperson may have been trying to save his commission still pretty tacky.

r3ttns,hmcybi1,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,Pushmonk,11/27/2021,8.0,Depends on the store. Many places honor that for any reason because overall people dont use it. Then if you dont use it after a certain time it turns into store credit. Gotta find a less shitty furniture store.
r3ttns,hmd9tjz,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,Dr_thri11,11/27/2021,7.0,Insurance/warranties only really make sense on stuff that you cant afford to replace if it fails.  For consumer goods just decline the warranty every time and youll come out ahead even if you get burnt once or twice.
r3ttns,hmcxluy,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,droppedbits,11/27/2021,18.0,Cars and tailored suits come to mind.  Really anything customizable though where there’s a salesperson as a middleman.  Hard to discern between incompetence and malicious intent though. Usually if the salesperson is very sly and upselly malicious intent. Sometimes an honest mistake. Smaller the business (like mom and pop shops) more chance of it being a mistake because things can be much more fast and loose.  At the end of the day the advertised price is the advertised price. They can sell it for the price they advertised or choose not to sell it but shouldn’t bait and switch you.
r3ttns,hmd98wo,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,janeusmaximus,11/27/2021,6.0,What credit card do you have that offers 24 months no interest without a credit check? I know some companies offer a promotion when you initially sign up after they run your credit but is there a card that does this after sign up? Amex plan it is 90 days and I’m pretty sure charges a fee. Genuinely interested. Have excellent credit but enough credit cards so if there’s one that consistently does 90 days or 24 months no interest with no fee I wanna know about it.
r3ttns,hmd0l3n,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,thishasntbeeneasy,11/27/2021,21.0,Moral of the story is be willing to walk. If you agree on $3000 and they say oops its $3200 Id say sorry but Im not here to play games and walk out. If they say no wait $3000 works Id counter for $2800 expecting them to scoff and lose the sale anyway.

r3ttns,hmd7w15,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,janeusmaximus,11/27/2021,1.0,So I worked at a furniture store for years and it is possible the salesman was telling the truth. This happened once with a power reclining sofa for instance. Someone had tagged it with price for manual recliners accidentally. Could also easily happen if it’s a sectional with many pieces. Like someone could have listed price with one console instead of two or left arm facing chair versus left arm facing recliner. If it didn’t have recliners and wasn’t a sectional probably just a grab for your money.

Ok take this barcode print-out to the cashier (where it is scanned like a normal item) and schedule a delivery or we will haul it to the back of the store and you can meet us there for pick up.   Sometimes the register would prompt the cashier to ask about insurance (and there was no commission so the cashier did not give a shit what you chose) but otherwise that was the whole process.

At least a good chunk wouldve gone to the employee probs.  >  Or is there some deeper reason like making me feel I got one over on them for paying $200 less that the “real” sticker?  Also very possible.
r3ttns,hmdakzz,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,kindrudekid,11/27/2021,6.0,They frequently run 0 fee promotions.  Currently I have 0 fee on my delta platinum and bonvoy cards for any plan I create before year end. Guess which card Im using for bf and Christmas shopping. And when I created a plan it gave me option to pay it off in 24 months. If you login you should see that in your offers.  Before that I had it on my blue cash. I put my entire 4k PC build on this and Im paying it off over 24 months.  I had same on my platinum too but never used it but I called and requested if they have any other offer and they offered 4%. It was worth it to add a shit ton of purchase before they devalued transfer to Schwab. The platinum one wouldnt let me setup more than 6 month plan.

r3s9xt,hmcmg8d,Life Insurance that doubles as an investment account?,Fenderstratguy,11/27/2021,5.0,Agree - if you are very wealthy there is a role for insurance to offset inheritance taxes etc. But for we mere mortals if they are selling you an annuity or a life insurance policy that is NOT term life insurance they are making a hefty commission on that sale. They are a salesman not a financial advisor who is working in your best interest. Ask them if they are a fiduciary (must put your interests first ahead of their company). Are they willing to put that in writing and sign? Ask how they get paid and what percent they get on commission for the insurance policy. If they cannot be up front or evade your questions - run away. I would run away anyway because most people do not recommend mixing insurance products with investment products.

I didnt think much of it and didnt take any pictures. When the bill showed up in august or early september it said i owed 800$ and i looked at the last read date which was in (if memory serves) august of 2019 and my new bill from the prev mentioned date said actual (the first time since moving in) so its not my usage but since they didnt have a reading until months after I bought the place they think i used all that extra gas and electric in the 6ish month period of me owning the house all because i didnt take the meter reading i should have when i moved in

I wish a spent a bit more on things I wanted when I was younger. Don’t question the stuff you really aren’t questioning. It sounds like you want this. You will still be a saver for the rest of your life and probably die a rich man. Take the nice apartment.
r3txb0,hmct1iu,Opinions on my rent budget in NYC,BoxerRumbleEJ257,11/27/2021,3.0,4500/mo rent would be \~30-35% of your net income.  With the plan to host out-of-town family often if you did the 1BR where would they stay?  As long as youre properly investing for other things (e.g. retirement savings etc.) if you want to splurge on your home space its not necessarily a bad thing. For example if youre what would be considered a homebody spending more on a space that makes you more comfortable outside of work could be a good thing overall. If you value traveling and going out to eat / drink a lot it would not be.  Ultimately this is a decision only you can truly make.

Go big! You would still be saving plenty. I value a home / apartment quite high since you can spend 60-100% of your time there.  Value per dollar is high.

But the result is not distinguishable from a 401K. Lots of non-profits have two 403B accounts one for your tax advantaged stuff and one for anything beyond that you elect to put in and their contributions. That separates out how they have to be taxed when you withdrawal assets better because taxes have been paid on one blob and the other they have not.

I was a CS for Invesco (shittiest place to work don’t do it) when we had 403b account holders contact us to make a withdraw we had to relay to the client that they have to fill out a paper form get it notarized then get the TPA or plan admin to sign off the forms send it all back to us and proceed as soon as we confirm docs.   The TPA/Plan Admin has authority to not allow a clients request for withdrawal for any reason termination is practically the only way YOU can initiate a for sure yes on your end.

r3wrdb,hmd9ujm,Credit limit increased and it's a problem,PentagonUnpadded,11/27/2021,4.0,You dont have to actively use a credit card to get the benefits of it. A majority of the impact a credit card has is the age of the credit line and if the account was ever in negative standing. You dont have to use it much to get those benefits.  Set one or two small subscriptions up to pay from the card enable autopay and destroy or hide the card. If you are the kind of person that will run up a bill the security and points benefits of a credit card are wiped out by the credit losses.

r3mgkm,hmbv4xq,Under-withheld....should I make a tax payment?,ahj3939,11/27/2021,1.0,Estimated tax payment isnt very helpful right now. You could increase witholdings on remaining paychecks for better results. Reason being is for estimated tax payments you have to calculate when you paid whereas with withholding it doesnt matter if it was early on time or late.  However dont stress it too much estimated tax penalty on $10k is like $175. Main thing is being able to pay the actual taxes by the due date.

(They did withhold 2 dollars from one paycheck! and they are withholding our state income tax.) But I have other income so married filing jointly puts us in the 22% bracket.  We also inherited some money that was withheld at only 10%.   A \*very rough\* estimate looks like well owe several thousand.   Its a little late to adjust the W-4...only one more check this year and that doesnt fix the problem with the inherited funds.  Should I try to make an estimate tax payment directly to the IRS?

r3mgkm,hmcgbb0,Under-withheld....should I make a tax payment?,kepler1,11/27/2021,2.0,They will tell by the fact that for the year you will have underpaid by several thousand $ (if it is as you said).   When you do your taxes that amount of underpayment will trigger the filing of forms 2210 (Underpayment of tax) and 1040-ES.  The online tax preparers will flag this as well.   On that form(s) is a quarterly (every 3 months) laying out of what was supposed to be due and how much you actually paid.  You yourself will have to calculate this although in theory as with all taxes the IRS already knows.   There are 2 methods for calculating how much should have been paid but roughly the idea is that in each quarter you should have paid tax on the amount of income during that quarter.   By the way I edited to add a piece of info above in my previous comment: *I believe the IRSs effective interest rate is something like 5-6% so mental math is that for every $1000 that you underpaid by a quarter you will owe a penalty of something like $15*. Which is not so bad really.   So anyway it probably is in your interest (unless you dont mind the penalty) to make an estimated payment roughly according to the amount you will underpay due to the extra income in the quarter in which is received.    You can read these for more info:   https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306 (Underpayment penalty)  https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2210.pdf (the quarterly schedule)   https://www.irs.gov/payments/underpayment-of-estimated-tax-by-individuals-penalty   and  https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes  (estimated tax payments quarterly -- see Chapter 2 Who has to pay)
r3meka,r3meka,"CC- Looking to build credit score and optimize rewards, which cards would be best?",1SecretUpvote,11/27/2021,0.0,So to start off this credit card will be opened in both my husbands name and my own. We both have bank accounts and credit cards separately bit wanted to both be listed on things related to the house.  I have good credit he has great credit. We both recently took a minor hit from refinancing our home where we added me to the mortgage it was only in his name previously because we hadnt been together long at that time. 7 years later we decided it was time.   Ive only had one credit card for several years (the ones I opened when I was young were awful so I closed them) and this is really what is limiting my credit score. Both of our vehicles are owned outright. He paid for his in cash years ago and I paid off mine a few years ago.   So the house is the only real debt we have. We both use our regular credit cards for pretty much everything and either pay them off in full or at least pay them down significantly every month.   Were about to completely renovate a kitchen and bathroom in our home so there will be a series of large purchases over the course of the next year. We already have the money for this from our cash out refi  Its just sitting in savings for the moment.   So were safe knowing we wont ever miss a payment since the funds are accounted for which means the apr is less important. Ive seen a lot of talk about churning and I think thats going to hurt my credit significantly and not something we want to chase since our energy and mental bandwidth is going to be taken by the projects.   So really its just whatever card we can get that will help build my score up and give us great rewards. (Air miles?)   However a big wrench here is that I am currently changing jobs. I start Monday hah. It will be a big pay increase for me but a portion of it is commission based so I dont truly know what my real wages will look like just yet.   Also as a side bar thought..  My new job is going to have a lot of driving involved and my employer will be reimbursing 100% but it will be me paying for it at the pump so I was thinking I should consider a card strictly used for that since I think there are some that have fuel rewards at a higher rate?    Any help would be appreciated!!

r3mm9b,hmbtvg3,College Student Investment Advice,BastidChimp,11/27/2021,1.0,You may want to check out dividend stocks on the Dividend Aristocrats list. Many are blue chip stocks that have been around for a while that pay out a regular quarterly dividend.
r3mm9b,hmbw9ff,College Student Investment Advice,BastidChimp,11/27/2021,1.0,Yup its best to diversify. Your ETFs cover a broad market. The thing about dividend stocks is that in time when your principal investment is substantial enough you can use the dividends without cashing out your stocks.
r3mm9b,hmblzul,College Student Investment Advice,metstickets719,11/27/2021,1.0,If you plan to invest in vanguard funds it probably makes sense to open a vanguard account as I believe Fidelity charges extra fees for investing in those funds. You could also look into the fidelity equivalent of the funds you wish to invest in. I am into the Bogleheads approach so Im roughly 75/25 split between FZROX & FZILX which are the zero expense funds with Fidelity. FZROX is similar to VTI while FZILX is similar to VXUS.
r3mm9b,r3mm9b,College Student Investment Advice,Sloggy_Starfish,11/27/2021,1.0,Hi everyone  Im a college student. I am having a Fidelity brokerage account that I plan to do long-term investment. I am planning to split 80% in ETF and the rest 20% in singular stocks. For ETF Im thinking of:  * VTI 50% * VGT 15% * VXUS/VEU 15% * VWO 10% * SOXX 10%  Is this profile too risky and volatile. As Im still young I think I  could handle some volatility and gain some exposure to the tech sector.  Do you guys have any recommendations on what ETF I should consider or  the ratio of those ETFs?  For 20% singular stock I am thinking of holding 3-5 companies like FB GOOGL TSLA and AAPL  Thank yall

r3mhmr,hmbj54y,Best way for early termination of a car lease?,Nexustar,11/27/2021,24.0,Leases usually have a buyout option... you sell the car and pay off the lease. Used car market is really good right now and a low mileage car should more than break even.  Even easier if hes trading it in to buy a cheaper new car.
r3mhmr,r3mhmr,Best way for early termination of a car lease?,OpeloRoad,11/27/2021,12.0,My nephew leased a BMW for $560/mo. just before COVID hit.  He cant afford the lease and insurance  any more and must just default leaving 24 mo. unpaid.  (Weve looked at other options but there is nothing without the lenders consent that that is not happening.)  What is the cleanest way to get out?  Offer to return the car and consent to a judgment?  That would reduce the incidental/repo fees the leasing company could impose correct?   He is disabled and unemployed so doesnt worry about garnished wages.

r3mhmr,hmbt2au,Best way for early termination of a car lease?,MangeLeBebe,11/27/2021,4.0,BMW does not currently allow 3rd party buyouts on their leased vehicles. Many captive lenders started disallowing this earlier in the year to help their manufacturers maintain revenue streams while their new car inventory dried up.  This means you cant just sell the car or trade it in like you can do with a traditionally financed vehicle.
r3mhmr,hmc4p92,Best way for early termination of a car lease?,MangeLeBebe,11/27/2021,1.0,While this is true all the offers I received from BMW dealers severely undercut the value of my specific model especially compared to 3rd party dealers. I assume because the BMW dealers know many lessees are stuck trading in or selling to them.
r3mhmr,hmc6t5y,Best way for early termination of a car lease?,j-christopher,11/27/2021,2.0,The dealer doesnt get the vehicle back the lessor does.  Many (perhaps most) dealers will accept lease returns on the lessors behalf because it gives the dealer the opportunity to put you into another new car.  My leased vehicle is kept at our home in Ohio.  I leased it from a dealer in the Washinton DC metro area.  I promise you Im not driving it to Northern Virginia when the lease is up.  its going to the closest BMW dealer to our house.

r3mgkm,hmbgafj,Under-withheld....should I make a tax payment?,kepler1,11/27/2021,3.0,Yes you could make a quarterly payment to reduce some or all of your under-withholding.   Youll need to read up on how quarterly payments if they come unevenly during the year will be used to calculate the amount of interest owed.   If I recall correctly you roughly pay a penalty in interest according to the number of tax quarters by which you underpaid.   I think this is form 1040-ES and related instructions.  Note that the word penalty sounds like as soon as you miss the target you have a big penalty.  But its not that bad -- you will have a penalty in proportion to the amount you underpaid and how long it was underpaid.   So 2 factors might make this less painful.  First even if you owe thousands at tax time due to under-withholding you only pay a smaller % penalty for not having withheld properly (and you wouldve had to pay the tax amount anyway).   I believe the IRSs effective interest rate is something like 5-6% so mental math is that for every $1000 that you underpaid by a quarter you will owe a penalty of something like $15.    Second underpayment penalties will not apply if you paid during the year withholding and estimated tax of at least 90% of the tax for the current year or 100% of the tax shown on the return for the prior year.   (110% for certain higher income households)    -- directly from the IRS: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306  So if you happen to qualify by that criterion you may not owe any penalty at all.  Of course you still have to pay the tax amount due.
r3mgkm,hmbznvt,Under-withheld....should I make a tax payment?,KReddit934,11/27/2021,1.0,So if I do make a payment I just need to get to that 100% number...that would give me an easier target.
r3mgkm,hmc6f7x,Under-withheld....should I make a tax payment?,vynm2,11/27/2021,1.0,Its not that simple. Those percentages have to be met by withholding and equal timely estimated tax payments for safe harbor to be met.   That said making an estimated tax payment now rather than waiting until you file your tax return will reduce the underpayment penalty you may owe.

r3m5se,hmbnk0v,Anyone here have experience with ISOs and NQs in a startup that went public?,anthonyp17,11/27/2021,1.0,Thank you for the insight. Its taken on a much bigger percentage over the past 2 years 20% or so seems to still leave room for nice gains if it spikes over the long-term while protecting myself from downside and my emotional reasoning of not seeing the downside.
r3m5se,hmc2bqw,Anyone here have experience with ISOs and NQs in a startup that went public?,anthonyp17,11/27/2021,1.0,Yes the $15 NQs are older. Nothing expires until 2029 and 2030.   Glad you brought up AMT that has thrown me for a loop in the past. My salary is $72000 -- so essentially the AMT exemption. Does that help make sense of my situation?  Ignoring AMT considerations total cost of ISO exercise would be $36k...wish I had that kind of cash to throw around but I dont...I worry that cash put toward these ISOs only exposes me deeper to this one company versus putting that cash in my personal brokerage in broad-market funds while -- one day -- doing a cashless exercise using the ISOs to buy and sell the ISOs.  Doing a little bit of the ISOs every year could be more palatable. Ive only exercised and held about 300 of them which I did last tax year so I still have time this year to do more.
r3m5se,hmdanys,Anyone here have experience with ISOs and NQs in a startup that went public?,Anonymoose2021,11/27/2021,2.0,AMT calculations are not always obvious.   You have to run your taxes both ordinary and AMT method to see of AMT is higher.   With $72k income your ordinary tax rate is not very high so you wont be able to exercise a lot of the stock without having to pay extra tax.   Definitely OK at 500 shares maybe 1000 but there isnt any shortcut.  You have to do a mock tax return both ways to see how much you can exercise without additional tax.
r3m5se,hmbupsf,Anyone here have experience with ISOs and NQs in a startup that went public?,Anonymoose2021,11/27/2021,1.0,The other factor is time until expiration of the option.   Im guessing that the $15 NQs are older than the $26 NQs.    I would exercise and sell the older NQs and then also exercise some of the older ISOs but not sell them.    How much of the ISOs you exercise depends on how much cash you have and at what point you would have to start paying tax on them. AMT exemption is about $115k and phaseout starts at taxable income of just over $1M (married filing jointly) so you should be able to exercise about 2800 shares of the $9 strike ISO and not owe any tax from that exercise.   That of course depends upon your other income and any AMT preference items you might have but that is a good guess for a start.     In other words you have an AMT exemption each year that you should be using to your advantage.  AMT exemption for single filer is $73.6K and phaseout starting at $523K.

My logic is that I can’t touch my company PSP without penalties until i’m 59.5 (with a few exceptions) which is 32.5 years away for me and it seems there’s no real benefit of a TIRA for me as I doubt my tax bracket will be lower than long term capital gains.  So is there any reason I should consider contributing to a TIRA that I am missing?  The Wiki says to avoid it unless doing a back door Roth which I don’t really want to do.  My plan is to fund a Betterment Smart Beta ETF on Monday but thought I’d ask for advice about the TIRA first.
r3jyv4,r3jyv4,Should I sell crypto to pay off my debts?,whatsmynamema,11/27/2021,0.0,I’m in about 9k debt total with credit cards loans and overdrafts and have almost 1/3 of that in crypto available to pay off some overdrafts with higher interest.  If everything went to plan I could pay off all my debts by the end of next year that’s with me being kind of (but not overly) strict with money and things going my way. I’ve been implementing this the past two months however and have made absolutely no progress due to many unexpected expenses. (Car troubles household items weddings etc)   The lack of progress the past two months despite me working incredibly hard to spend less it’s really frustrating and disheartening I’ll be honest.   The debts do stress me out a fair bit also although I’m realising I’m way too easily stressed out. I struggle with all things stressful and often impulse buy to relieve stress (vicious cycle eh) I think it’s my adhd that makes it so difficult to do the simple things consistently.  Anyways would I be better off paying my two overdrafts off completely ( 20-£30 interest monthly with each) with crypto money? Part of me really wants to do it to see those overdrafts gone and get the ball rolling again. But I just can’t help thinking All I gotta do is be more mindful with my spending and it could be paid off in 12 months anyways.. just gotta deal with the stress.   What’s best thing to do in this situation?
r3jyv4,hmba1ea,Should I sell crypto to pay off my debts?,snorkleface,11/27/2021,27.0,Yes 1000x yes sell the crypto to pay off the debts. Especially if you can knock two cards out immediately by doing so.

Imo yes pay as much debt as you can now if it’s high interest debt (over 4-5%).  Paying off debt is almost like a guaranteed return. You can continue to average into crypto while paying off your remaining debts. It will be here for awhile and the market is just growing.  The mental ease from having little or no debt and the freedom to invest your extra cash as you see fit is worth it. Just my 2¢
r3jyv4,hmbn5ty,Should I sell crypto to pay off my debts?,Varathien,11/27/2021,3.0,Yes definitely sell the crypto to pay off debt.

r3jyv4,hmbhhlr,Should I sell crypto to pay off my debts?,xxxsoap,11/27/2021,2.0,There is some solid advice here. To reiterate paying off a debt is a guaranteed return. Having debt isnt a bad thing but theres a difference between a 3.4% Auto Loan and a 16-23% variable interest credit card.   Cryptocurrency markets are volatile so you might be able to get a higher return than 23%. However if the interest owed is lets say 15% on 9k you have to get at least a 45% return on 3k of Cryptocurrency just to break even. Just crunch the numbers but tbh itd be best to pay off the debt and cost average back into your investments.

Theres a camp that says its the new money and will take over the world and then theres the other camp that says that its a nice brain teaser but nothing more.  People have speculated on crazy things in the past [the tulip bubble of the 1600s is case in point.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutch_tulip_bulb_market_bubble.asp)  If you believe this is going to be the new money youd probably want to hold on to your crypto.

I hadnt thought of talking to my boss but I have heard of CPAs through coworkers that I could speak with.   If the strike on the ISOs is around $9 for one batch and $15 for another and the strike on the NQs is around $15 for one batch and $26 for another and the current FMV is around $50 what would you exercise first when diversifying?
r3m5se,hmcfqrq,Anyone here have experience with ISOs and NQs in a startup that went public?,micha8st,11/27/2021,1.0,Never done a startup and never ISOs but Ive played with NQSOs and RSUs for over 20 years.  Grants and Lots.  * every time they give you new paperwork thats a grant. * each grant (for me) consists (now) of 3 lots.  The first lot vests 1 year after the grant the second lot 2 years after and the final the third year after.  I now get RSUs not NQSOs.  Ive been feeling like the worth of my vested RSUs is too high so I have a sell strategy.    * Sell so long as the total value of the shares held is greater than some arbitrary value Ive decided upon. * Each time I sell I use a limit order one lot at a time. * The next sale gets entered the night after the previous lot sells for some higher price.  Something like =ceil(P\*1.11).  a few years ago (right before the great recession I was sitting on a pile of mostly unvested NQSOs when my employer became the target of two private equity firm consortiums.  They bid each other up a little before one dropped out.  While there was still uncertainty I exercised and sold all the shares I could hoping that the final transaction would happen in the next year.  It happened in december of the same year so I got cash for all the unvested shares at that point.  The total cash-out was 4x my regular salary...and taxes were bloody.  Because we had less than a month and we decided to give 10% of the largesse away we spent about a month picking a bunch of different charities to give to.  In terms of keeping taxes down?  Just keep an eye on tax brackets.  RSUs they give you the shares outright when they vest and in my case I sell-to-cover -- that means I sell enough shares to cover the taxes that get withheld.  Lets say you have some options with a price of $12 and the stock is trading at 20.  Its typical to sell-to-cover at that point -- you can sell some of your shares immediately to pay for the buy at $12/share.  Then you hold the rest -- you own them.  Youll pay taxes (I think short term capital gains) on the shares you sell.  The rest if you hold for at least a year youll end up paying long term capital gains relative to the $8 you buy at.  At least thats how I think the taxes work.  (Its been a while since I dealt with NQSOs.)  The key is to meter out your sales so that you dont jump too far up the tax brackets.
r3m5se,hmbiu4n,Anyone here have experience with ISOs and NQs in a startup that went public?,OperaticIguana,11/27/2021,2.0,A general recommendation is to have no more than 20% of a portfolio in a single stock. The same rule should apply to your employers stock as well. So you should consider strategies to sell as much as possible and diversify.  This is likely a scenario where its worth talking to a CPA (certified public accountant) about how to minimize tax burden when diversifying.

My girlfriend makes 2200 a month. Our current apartment rent is about 1500 a month after all utilities. Power water insurance like the total package.  I think the problem with this is we are basically paying out 39% of our income to pay for our current place with both of us working 44 hours a week. Ideally I want that to be closer to 30%.   I am looking at housing costs and me and her really want something on one floor which even as a condo in our area cost 240k on the low end.   So if I got a condo for 240k. Sold 40k stock as a down payment and then our payments would be 1100 a month before insurance and utilities.  Would planning on doing something like this in 24 to 36 months be a bad idea? Hoping by then Im making 15% more and her too. Im not sure if hone ownership is feasible for a couple making 90k in annual before taxes in this market.  What things do I need to think about financially for the next few years getting married etc?
r3m8f8,hmbru01,Question on home ownership.,GummyRice1,11/27/2021,1.0,I’m a believer in growing net worth by buying a place rather than pissing it away to landlords.  Of course you’re still paying the bankers the worth of the house in interest over 30 years but one thing at a time.  Get the house and make your next plan after.

r3m8f8,hmbupmd,Question on home ownership.,Joloven,11/27/2021,2.0,Thanks again for this lesson on hone economics. 1% of home value per year in repairs or upgrades and vto pay 25% more than the mortgage in hoa insurance and taxes
r3m8f8,hmbgu63,Question on home ownership.,CQME,11/27/2021,4.0,> I sincerely hope that I can turn my investment to double  All I can say is caveat emptor.  Standard advice is to not put things youll need in the short-to-medium term in the stock market.  Yes in the long term stocks outperform just about anything else but short to medium term anything can happen and I mean anything.  Good luck =)
r3m8f8,hmbfqes,Question on home ownership.,Joloven,11/27/2021,2.0,After we get married we are not having kids. We both like a stable boat. We are cruising but need am emergency fund in case the car breaks down.  I still have an optimistic outlook on my investments though I forsee a down before an up. If I pulled out of the market now in full I would pay 4k in taxes and while I see a dip coming with the omicron varieties I see it as a short term nor long issue.  Maybe Im nuts. Thank you cqme for the well thought out reply
r3m8f8,hmc7t1l,Question on home ownership.,Dopeshow4,11/27/2021,1.0,They way prices on real estate are going it seems like a decent idea. We all need a place to live and housing doesnt seem like it going to be in a surplus for awhile.
r3m8f8,hmbugm1,Question on home ownership.,Joloven,11/27/2021,3.0,Oof. Thanks for the reality check. It seems key. I did look up properly taxes and its around 1200 a year around here. I can see 1500 easy so the real ownership cost of a home is like 25% higher as a rule than it appears.  I appreciate the emergency fund advise too. All of thus is key to planning
r3m8f8,hmbmr4g,Question on home ownership.,CQME,11/27/2021,3.0,You know I can even go into a personal example when it comes to maintenance.  I own a house right now brand new construction.  Havent paid a dime in maintenance of any sort...yet.  To buy this house I had to finish renovations on one I was looking to sell...those renovations cost upwards of $30k to include tearing out the carpet and installing tile dealing with 2 leaking toilets both of which cause mold damage retiling one of the shower stalls a hole in the patio roof installing concrete in the driveway (dirt was entering the garage) cutting down the dead tree in the front yard and replanting another one irrigation system for the new tree and the least of all my concerns pulling out weeds which filled up a u-haul trailer.  Thats just what I remember.  I believe the article says to expect 1% of house price per year in maintenance so in your case around $2500/yr but if you had to replace a roof youre going to need probably $15k or so to replace it.  So youd probably want $15k on hand and then replenish whatever you spent that year on an annual basis which hopefully will be $2500 or less.
r3m8f8,hmbict5,Question on home ownership.,Joloven,11/27/2021,2.0,True. Say when you say signicantlu less affordable than what Im doing now what sort of math are we looking at realistically?  I think for now. My short term goal needs to be to earn more so our income is 3x our rent plus utilities. Once that is achieved if we are frugal we can save up.
r3m8f8,hmbkyvj,Question on home ownership.,CQME,11/27/2021,3.0,Ok...lets give this a shot.  Just FYI things may change depending upon where you are in the country.  Right now youre paying $1500/mo period.  Youre looking for a condo with a $1100/mo mortgage.    Add taxes and insurance lets say 1% property tax and $1000/yr insurance youre looking at around $3500/yr about $300/mo.    Add HMO lets say $200/mo.  Right now for this condo youre looking at $1600/mo and thats not including utilities or maintenance.  [This is a fairly good list](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/mortgages/expenses-of-home-ownership/) of what to expect outside of the mortgage.  They put in closing costs/escrow prepaids/mortgage points in there which is kind of silly since all that is part of the check you cut when you give the down payment but the rest of the list is pretty solid.
r3m8f8,hmbg786,Question on home ownership.,Joloven,11/27/2021,2.0,I think its important if we get a house that it be a blessing and not make us house poor. I sincerely hope that I can turn my investment to double before I buy a house so the down payment will make a more reasonable impact on my investment
r3m5se,r3m5se,Anyone here have experience with ISOs and NQs in a startup that went public?,anthonyp17,11/27/2021,1.0,Ive worked for the same company for three years and we IPOd two years ago.   I have a combination of **Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) Non-qualified Stock Options (NQs)** and **shares** (from both RSU grants and our Employee Share Purchase Plan). The vesting schedule is complicated because there are so many different timelines but Im about 60% vested right now across the board. February 2022 is a big milestone for vesting and itll be about 75% by then.  I understand the shares are just like shares in any old company but as far as the ISOs and NQs go I would like to have a better plan on how to treat them. I dont have an immediate need for any of the cash from the options or shares.  I am bullish on the company but I recognize the risk of marrying exposure to one stock—especially one thats also my employer. The rest of my retirement and brokerage account is in broad-market funds but my equity from my employer is worth about 2x more than retirement and brokerage combined at current FMV. When I joined the company I wasnt sure if my equity would ever be worth anything and Im fortunate that its worked out.  Im not looking for exact advice about what to do because things change—market goes up and down and around—but knowing I will most likely continue working here for the next few years and I have until 2029 until any options expire who should I be talking to or what steps should I be taking to make a plan to get the most out of my equity and not end up with a dumb tax bill selling or exercising everything at the same time?
r3m5se,hmbjwls,Anyone here have experience with ISOs and NQs in a startup that went public?,Anonymoose2021,11/27/2021,3.0,The tax implications of ISOs and NQs are very different.   This often leads people to exercise and hold ISO but to do an immediate exercise and sell of NQ options.   The NQ option gain from strike price to market price will be treated like W2 income.   The strike to market difference when exercising an ISO is AMT income but not ordinary income.   There is an AMT exemption amount so you should be exercising ISOs to just below the point where you owe AMT.  Co-workers particularly your boss (since he knows your option grant sizes) are generally a good place to start with your questions.   They may also have recommend stations for CPAs or CFPs that can help you plan the best way to handle the exercise of these options.
r3m5se,hmbdh9u,Anyone here have experience with ISOs and NQs in a startup that went public?,CQME,11/27/2021,2.0,I dont have experience with these but I understand the concept and what the super wealthy do with these kind of positions - they borrow off them and use loans to pay for things so that 1) they dont have to pay any capital gains tax and 2) they can still fully participate in their companys hopefully bright future.  In fact they could probably write off the interest if set up to do so and offset income.  Depending upon how much you have a wealth manager at a big bank could probably get you started or at least familiarized with how your situation works no commitment necessary for a consult.
r3m8f8,hmbf42v,Question on home ownership.,CQME,11/27/2021,5.0,>I have 3k in debts at a 5% interest and 4k in emergency funds with 55k in stocks which I want to leave as a long position but I could pull them out on a 3 day notice for extra emergency funds.  It sounds like youre aware that a prudent thing to do would be to further pad your emergency fund a bit so that you wont have to sell stocks in an emergency.  If an emergency like say job loss occurred concomitantly with a recession (happens all the time) your stocks will get pummeled and youll have to sell precisely when you want to be buying.  >I think the problem with this is we are basically paying out 39% of our income to pay for our current place with both of us working 44 hours a week. Ideally I want that to be closer to 30%.  Yes good.  >So if I got a condo for 240k. Sold 40k stock as a down payment and then our payments would be 1100 a month before insurance and utilities.  Youre going to need a (much) bigger cash cushion.  If you get a condo youll probably have HOA fees on top of taxes and insurance.  This will probably make your condo purchase significantly less affordable on a monthly basis than what you are doing now.  Youre also going to have to set aside optimally $15-20k for unexpected maintenance issues...after all its your condo you have to fix it.  IMHO I dont think youre ready for this yet you need more planning and ideally more cash.  You can instead pay a lot less down and hold onto that extra cash for these contingencies just be aware that your monthly expenses are likely going to go up not down if you make your planned purchase.  >Would planning on doing something like this in 24 to 36 months be a bad idea? Hoping by then Im making 15% more and her too. Im not sure if hone ownership is feasible for a couple making 90k in annual before taxes in this market.  This sounds feasible especially if both of you work towards saving up cash for this purchase.  You may also want to consider getting out of the stock market now if you are going to rely upon those funds for your down payment in order to decrease risk and volatility.  >What things do I need to think about financially for the next few years getting married etc?  This is a much bigger question lol...depends upon what yall want to do after getting married.  =)
r3jyv4,hmbvvhx,Should I sell crypto to pay off my debts?,Consensual-Sex,11/27/2021,2.0,Yes and no.   When it comes to any investment of course no one knows what’s going to happen in the future.   But if a company is showing growth and turning an increasing profit YOY people who invest in that knowing they have financials are still “speculating” to a point but it’s more educated speculation.   Most investors would sooner put money in a promising business than some random unknown company. So you can’t really compare them by just saying both are speculative when there’s more to it than that.   That being said I’m not an expert on crypto. I do have a hard time seeing how it’s not a bubble without any sort of tangible product. At some point enough people pull their coins out and the price crashes and it just sucks for anyone still holding. I’d like to be wrong about it but like I said I don’t know enough about crypto I don’t want to pretend I’m an expert.

r3ms86,hmd4q4c,Managing new income,Ainulindala,11/27/2021,1.0,Id second the advice to pay down the 1.8% student loans at the regular non-accelerated rate and invest the extra money instead. Lots of places you can get more than 1.8% safely. (For instance both you and your spouse can buy $10000 in i-bonds each year. They have a variable rate that tracks inflation so the current rate is like 7% or something crazy like that. Hopefully that doesnt last.)

r3o6au,hmchvp8,what exactly is special financing?,Elegeios,11/27/2021,2.0,The thing costs $1200.  You buy with with your Amazon card and select the pay over time method.  Depending on the details youll get 0% financing for the purchase.   Youll see the full balance - $1200 - on your statement but you wont pay any interest on it so long as you make the payments.  The payments are apparently $70 a month. Is that for 18 months? 12 months?  Fast forward 6 or 12 or 18 months you sure as shit better make sure the card is paid off *with a month to spare* or youll get ravaged by what is probably 20%+ APR.  Make sure you do the math and ensure that your monthly payment has you cleared of debt *before the last month*.
r3o6au,r3o6au,what exactly is special financing?,applexpeel,11/27/2021,2.0,Hello everyone to make this question short and sweet i would like to get a macbook pro that i can get on amazon for 200 dollars off along with my own employee credit and points. I want to use my amazon credit card as well. If i buy the laptop for 1200 on payment plan for $70 for 18 months (i definitely plan on paying it off within 3 months though) will the full $1200 purchase be on my credit statement? or just 70 a month since that’s what the payment plan says?
r3o6au,hmbrbar,what exactly is special financing?,LaughingIshikawa,11/27/2021,1.0,... wait so youre using your credit card... To buy something on credit? (Thats what a payment plan is.)  Why use both forms of credit?  Why not use just one or the other (ie $70 a month cash or debit or $1200 credit?)
r3o6au,hmcr4uy,what exactly is special financing?,applexpeel,11/27/2021,1.0,yeah it was 18 months. i just rounded the 66 nd some change to $70. The main concern i had was would my statement show i have a $1200 purchase or would it say 70 since that’s all i’ll be paying on it that month.
r3o6au,hmc79bw,what exactly is special financing?,applexpeel,11/27/2021,1.0,yes it would but that’s the thing i don’t want to have the full price on my statement anyway

r3o6au,hmbub2y,what exactly is special financing?,applexpeel,11/27/2021,1.0,that’s exactly what i’m confused about because the terms say 1200 will be charged but only 70 a month will be on the statement. however if the full charge is on the card then wouldn’t the full balance of the card also be on the statement ?
r3o6au,hmcr63x,what exactly is special financing?,applexpeel,11/27/2021,1.0,awesomeee thank you

r3o5lx,r3o5lx,Withdrawing pension early (hardship),samrozzi,11/27/2021,1.0,So first I know most will say it’s not smart long term to withdraw from your pension all that I get skipping that just trying to see if theirs certain regulations  rules or ways to withdraw from mine?   Mines through fidelity and it’s a work one they put into. I know traditionally if you quit your job you can transfer it or withdraw but is their shy way to withdraw some or all while still employed through some type of withdrawal / hard ship withdrawal?
r3o5lx,hmbpzh3,Withdrawing pension early (hardship),samrozzi,11/27/2021,1.0,I’ve seen the loans through my 401k Roth IRA but you can also do a pension loan? Wasn’t aware of that will have to call HR and see.
r3o5lx,hmbpv81,Withdrawing pension early (hardship),Mysterre,11/27/2021,2.0,Yes - you should be able to contact them and ask about a loan if you don’t want to withdraw. We did that earlier this year to buy an investment property.

r3oag0,r3oag0,Investment Calculator with an Increasing Contribution Relative to Inflation,ReadyCharge1,11/27/2021,1.0,Im looking for a calculator (or formula) to calculate an investment return when considering a monthly contribution that increases relative to inflation. Eg something along the lines of: assuming a 2% annual inflation and a starting monthly contribution of $1000 the next year would have a monthly contribution of $1020 then $1040 then $1061 and so on.  All the calculators Ive found ([example](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html?ctype=endamount&ctargetamountv=1000000&cstartingprinciplev=0&cyearsv=40&cinterestratev=11&ccompound=annually&ccontributeamountv=500&cadditionat1=end&ciadditionat1=monthly&printit=0&x=80&y=-1)) use a fixed contribution which seems silly when looking at goals 30 or 40 years in the future.

The more significant score factor would be the new account reporting which will lower the average age of accounts.  This may also be a non-factor if one has a deep long credit history.

r3o6au,hmc7wz8,what exactly is special financing?,PM_YOUR_MANATEES,11/27/2021,2.0,Youre going to get charged full price at some point whether or not you choose payments. If you want a smaller BALANCE to show make a payment as soon as the transaction posts and before the balance is reported to the credit bureau.

r3nrwf,hmbrp70,FICO vs VantageScore. Which one matters/most accurate?,93195,11/27/2021,2.0,FICO.    But if someone asks you feel free to use whichever one best suits the message you want to convey as either answer is true.  Most people don’t even know there is more than one anyway (there’s actually at least 10 scores including different FICO models - I think they’re up to about FICO 10 now).
r3nrwf,hmbtbvt,FICO vs VantageScore. Which one matters/most accurate?,Cruian,11/27/2021,2.0,> typically the highest score from the three agencies is used.  Personal loans and credit cards may often only pull 1 lenders preference. Not highest.  Mortgages use the middle of the 3 mortgage scores.

r3nm5r,hmbqyu5,Tax on social security on TransferWise,vynm2,11/27/2021,1.0,Is there income generated in the Wise account (e.g. interest)? If so then that would be considered your income.  This does sound a little sketchy. Are you sure the money being held in that account is legally obtained? If not you could have bigger issues than the potential tax consequences. It can be very risky to hold money for someone else if you dont know them ***very*** well.
r3nm5r,hmcnfyr,Tax on social security on TransferWise,confused_girl172,11/27/2021,1.0,It’s a legal business. That’s not an issue I’m sure. The money keeps flowing from the account but I do have some $$ right now.

There is also a more advanced web site: https://ssa.tools where you can plug in the ssa.gov info and get more detailed analysis. This is not a government web site but it is legit and well respected.
r3nfrl,hmbyz5a,Is there a source to see how much money can be expected to receive through social security? (USA),lucky_ducker,11/27/2021,2.0,He can create an account on [ssa.gov](https://ssa.gov) where he can see his earnings history and future benefit projections. Caveat: the benefit projections are calculated assuming you will continue to earn an inflation-adjusted wage equivalent to your most recent years reported income. So if retirement is a long way off take the estimates with a grain of salt as your earnings may fluctuate (or stop). Im 3 to 7 years away from retirement and will likely stay in the same position Im in until then - so the estimates are starting to firm up for me.

r3n9xa,r3n9xa,How can I calculate debt of a loan to a friend using google sheets?,Eva_Zorro,11/27/2021,3.0,I gave a friend 5100 bucks a few months ago and we agreed 8% APY since that is the interest I was getting where I had that money.  Im not looking to profit from him only not to lose if I had not lend him I would now have 5210.80 bucks according to [this calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/apy).  How can I calculate the amount owed after he (hopefully) starts making payments when he is able to?  &#x200B  If you are curious:  * the loan was for buying land he is also buying materials to build a house and paying workers so he is not going to be able to pay back for some time. * the money was in USDT (Tether crypto stable coin) and I had it in [Nexo.io](https://Nexo.io) which gives 8% APY the loan was on August 17th so its been 102 days.  Americans will probably have a hard time understanding this arrangement since AFAIK they can easily get much better deals from banks but in Argentina home loans are very rare/difficult to obtain they never give you the full amount you usually need to have at least 50% in cash the requirements are bs and the interest rates are a lot higher (AFAIK I try to never deal with bank and never use credit or take a loan) even other kind of loans will have much higher interest rates everything money related in Argentina is crazy TBH.

r3n56z,r3n56z,Pre-Tax 457(b) Loan Payment,asker2021,11/27/2021,1.0,I was able to take some loan early this year from my 457(b) for family use and been religiously paying it. However whenever I search about paying the 457 loan “double taxing” always comes up. I read that some plans they deduct the loan payment post-tax but mine deducts it pre-tax same as the contribution. Does this mean I will not be double tax-ed or there’s a plot twist when I file my taxes for 2021 that I should look out for?
r3n12k,r3n12k,3 People On Title & Selling Home -> 2 People On Title In New Home,Nerev33,11/27/2021,2.0,Located In CA  Short Background  My wife and I were looking to buy a house a decade ago when we were pregnant with our first child we didnt have a lot of money so we were looking at condos and my mother approached us saying she could give us $100k so we can buy a house so we said yes. She later stated she wanted to be on the deed (shes not on the mortgage) and that she wanted her own room as my siblings moved to other states so we said OK to both. Well fast forward 10 years and with 4 kids we need to buy a bigger house. My wife and I make considerably more money have money put aside but want my mother off the deed. Primary reason is because shes very hard to get a hold of (travels internationally doesnt check email or text) and we literally almost couldnt refinance our house because they needed her financial information.  Question  What is the easiest way to get someone moved off the deed? Ive done some research but want to make sure this is right:  1. Quitclaim is the easiest if she agrees 2. Partition a Property and a lawyer if she doesnt (she isnt the nicest person sometimes) 3. We sell the house and she gets 1/3 of the profit which is around $100k we use our 2/3 profit to buy our house (and were still going to give her a room regardless)  Ideally situation #1 happens but if situation #3 happens how does the mechanics of this work when selling a house to buy a new house? Typically you sell your house and have a clause stating you have \~90 days to find a new home so you can roll your mortgage into a new one. Would we need to sell the home my mother gets her $100k and we roll our $200k equity into a new home with the mortgage being the difference in the 90 days period? Am I missing anything else?

This isnt usually the case any more. It will probably just be easiest to sell the house outright pay off the mortgage and get a new mortgage for your new house.
r3ms86,r3ms86,Managing new income,Adorable_Tour_2892,11/27/2021,4.0,Hello all  Im a recent graduate from a residency program and therefore am navigating the new world of my student loan repayment and higher income. Ive read through the wiki on where to place my money which has been fantastic to get me started but I wanted to discuss my current plan with you all as it is veering slightly from your recommendations to help meet our future goals. I like to think Im fairly aware of our finances but if you think our situation would benefit from a professional financial advisor let me know. Any advice is greatly appreciated!  Background: Married 30 years old no kids. Combined income \~340k. Currently maxing out both 401k plans and I have an additional work pension as well. Have not started an additional IRA. Take home pay monthly \~18k. Student loan debt 375k (1.8% interest rate) monthly payment at 5k on 7 year plan. We own a home with mortgage of 2k per month. Additional monthly spending around 5-7k. This leaves an additional \~4-5k per month planning to place 2k towards loans and rest towards additional savings. We keep 1 month worth of expenses in our checking (15k) and have saved up another 4 months in a savings account (65k).  This is where my questions begin.  1. 65k in savings seems a bit expensive as I cant imagine needing this much liquid cash available at all times. Am I crazy to place 35k into an index fund and keep 30k in the savings (and 15k in checkings). This would still leave me with 3 months expenses in cash with a potential to tap into more if needed but accepting some risk if the market is down. Or should I keep the extra in a CD/bond given we may take it out in a relatively short time (7 years) for a down payment? 2. Is there tax benefit to maxing out an IRA for the 2 of us as well? Im already maxing out our 401k plans and have additional pension that my work puts in to. Or should I place this into my brokerage account for greater liquidity if needed? 3. I have a super low interest rate on my loans but my current goal is to pay this off as fast as possible to be debt free and open us up to being able to move closer to where we want to end up long term. Is this a dumb plan given the low interest rate and opportunity cost with that extra money? Or is my savings we currently have sufficient to use the extra towards the loans?  Again I really appreciate all of your advice in helping me navigate the world of personal finance!
r3ms86,hmbmos9,Managing new income,Adorable_Tour_2892,11/27/2021,2.0,Awesome thanks again for the advice. Nice to just have somebody to bounce your thoughts off of to ensure Im not crazy. Ill get the backdoor started before they take away the opportunity!
r3ms86,hmbm7pm,Managing new income,UGA10,11/27/2021,1.0,1.  Im in the same boat but not that much spending. I just count my necessity money needed each month. What I would need if we both lost our jobs.  2.  Yes. A Roth IRA will grow tax free and is tax free on withdrawal in retirement.  You can only put in $6000 per year per person though so you will still have a brokerage after that.  Also Congress is trying to do away with the backdoor roth so keep an eye on that.    3.  Id probably lean towards getting out of debt too so you arent alone in that mindset.
r3ms86,hmbksl7,Managing new income,Adorable_Tour_2892,11/27/2021,1.0,Thanks for the reply!  1. Thats my thought. Although technically a true 6 month emergency fund with our current $14000 monthly spending would be $84k which seems way excessive. If we really were in an emergency lost a job situation wed cut our spending and I could defer my loans which places the real 6 month fund near $30-35k. Thats where I came up with that number to keep in the savings account. 2. I currently have no IRA set up. Just what goes into our 401k and then a fidelity brokerage account. Ive looked into the roth backdoor you think thatd be superior to putting into a brokerage? 3. Thanks for the feedback! Tough battling with my self looking at the potential versus getting out of debt.
r3nm5r,r3nm5r,Tax on social security on TransferWise,confused_girl172,11/27/2021,1.0,My boyfriend is in a foreign country and uses transfer wise that we made with my social security Bcz I’m in USA.   He holds his money here and I transfer them to him through Skrill( my social security is attached to Skrill as I need it to make an account)   Am I liable to pay taxes on that money that is received on Wise considering the account is attached to my social security? I don’t want to get in trouble with the IRS at the end of the year.   Or do I just empty the account delete it and forget about it ?
r3npau,r3npau,I stepped down from my position but they never changed my wage,SnooDonuts2973,11/27/2021,138.0,I stepped down from my position as a supervisor about a month ago and my hourly rate was never changed. When I met with my manager and HR about stepping down nothing was said about what my new wage would be. I know an estimate of what the pay for my new position is but I haven’t signed anything or talked about my new job description or pay. In this case since nothing has been discussed about my new pay could they take back the money they are “overpaying me”? Should I say something or just wait for them to notice?
r3npau,hmbn8kb,I stepped down from my position but they never changed my wage,artificialterf,11/27/2021,185.0,Believe or not they normally don’t cut your pay when you are demoted or take a “lower” position. Once you get the higher pay for whatever reason you likely get to keep it unless you’re fired.   No they can’t ask for or take it back. Don’t bother mentioning it.
r3npau,hmd3iuw,I stepped down from my position but they never changed my wage,boonxeven,11/27/2021,12.0,Maybe it depends on the field? Im a manager in a tech/cyber field. Had a guy that got hired as a senior engineer it was obvious after he started that he was better at interviewing than doing the actual work. As a non senior engineer he would have been pretty good. Talked with HR after 6 months of OJT not helping and they said lower title and expectations same pay no raise next raise cycle. He felt relieved because he was really struggling and had the opportunity to progress to the senior role at his own pace.

r3nrwf,r3nrwf,FICO vs VantageScore. Which one matters/most accurate?,likeabutterfly_,11/27/2021,6.0,My FICO is 800 and VantageScore is 697. This is a huge difference. If someone were to ask me what my credit score is which do I go off by?
r3nrwf,hmbnorr,FICO vs VantageScore. Which one matters/most accurate?,ahj3939,11/27/2021,3.0,FICO claims their score is used in 90% of lending decisions. Im unaware of any lender that uses Vantagescore.  Another thing to keep in mind is you have 3 different credit reports and you could be seeing a FICO score based on Equifax for e.g. and a Vantagescore from Transunion. There could be a collections account on Transunion that is dropping your scores. Generally for someone with established credit history the scores tend to be pretty similar.

r3nrwf,hmbnaah,FICO vs VantageScore. Which one matters/most accurate?,zhonzhon,11/27/2021,2.0,FICO is the one typically used.  and there are three credit agencies that report FICO (transuniuon experian and equifax).  even your fico score will vary between the three agencies.   typically the highest score from the three agencies is used.
r3nrwf,hmbudlp,FICO vs VantageScore. Which one matters/most accurate?,HorizontalBob,11/27/2021,2.0,Ask them what they use.   Typically  youre seeing a FICO 8 from one of the 3 bureaus. Its possible you have a 700 FICO 8 site from a credit bureau too. You should check all 3 reports to make sure the data is correct.  The data is whats used by the algorithms to make your scores.  FICO has over 30 different scores.   Ive never seen any lender that uses Vantagescore but its a way to track changes in site without the site paying FICO.

r3npau,hmbozsx,I stepped down from my position but they never changed my wage,_DeadSeaSquirrel,11/27/2021,214.0,They cant ask for the money back because there is no money to return.   They can lower your pay going forward but you need to agree to it (or choose to be let go).

r3ms86,hmbjev6,Managing new income,UGA10,11/27/2021,2.0,1.  $65000 is a lot. Nothing wrong with putting some in a brokerage account.  Just make sure you have a 6 month emergency fund NOT in the market.   2.  A Roth IRA is a good option but you would need to do backdoor roth contributions.  Do you have any pre-tax money in a Traditional IRA currently?  If so you will run into the pro rata rule.   3.  1.8% is low enough that you are most likely better off investing money over paying extra towards the loans. That said nobody will fault you for trying to get out of debt faster.

That said if they intended to keep you at that pay then youre voluntarily giving it up.  If this were me Id pocket the difference. Id save it anyways so it would be there in case I needed to pay it back.  I might try to bring it up off-handed in conversation to see if any flags would be triggered. I definitely wouldnt ask them if Im being over-paid.

So dont worry and dont waste time on that. If it is an error then IT IS THEIR ERROR. not your. Specially you didnt sigh any new contract for a new wage. I am sure this is illegal if they want to take those money back.    Good luck and enjoy the money.

r3jyv4,hmbye87,Should I sell crypto to pay off my debts?,MovieJunior,11/27/2021,2.0,Yes but traditionak index crowd are betting that the entire world economy is going to keep growing vs crypto and more speculative investors betting that a particular asset or company will keep going up.   It’s way more likely that the index investor will be right and find success and odds are if they’re horribly wrong that there the speculative bets wouldn’t fair any better and that they would be screwed regardless.  Also crypto has only been around for a little over a decade. That’s not long enough to 100% determine long term patterns. Stocks on the other hand have been around for a few centuries.   I agree that crypto at this point is probably going to stay but the market’s still in it’s infancy and i liken crypto to tech stocks in the 90’s. Lots of profit bearing potential that many don’t see yet but odds are high that a lot of the assets around today won’t make it long term and a crypto crash could absolutely be around the corner.
r3jyv4,hmbma37,Should I sell crypto to pay off my debts?,Billsrealaccount,11/27/2021,4.0,Well crypto currently has near zero utility besides being used as place to store real money.  It has yet to be adopted as a currency for anything that matters.

r3ge29,hmcuqob,Is marriage expensive?,lightnglass,11/27/2021,1.0,Female here my Mother always taught me from a young age to be able to support myself so that if I had to leave a relationship I could.  I am in a long term relationship (not married dont care about going through the legalities of it all) and being together definitely is cheaper in the sense of we both contribute to our living expenses which works out to be cheaper for both of us than if we were paying separate mortgages/housing expenses etc.  However if shit hit the fan tomorrow I can walk away without paying a dime to my significant other since we arent married and dont own any assets together and I am able to support myself 100% as I never put myself in a position to completely rely on someone else financially.     I dont think marriage in and of itself is expensive it is probably less expensive than being on your own.  However I think what your sister is trying to instill in you is that you should put yourself in a position where you are never relying on your husband for your finances (like quitting a job and not working and depending on his income to survive).

r3ge29,hmb7z8m,Is marriage expensive?,Mezzylu,11/27/2021,17.0,On a similar point sis might be thinking more like advising op to become capable of supporting herself before she ends up totally dependent upon her BF to make ends meet.   Once upon a time women went from parents to husband with no emphasis on self sufficiency. If you end up divorced after that you may find yourself initially helpless unless you get a big divorce settlement.   That being said having someone that has your back in everything financial and otherwise massively reduces the stress of life. Just be on the same page.

I want to marry my bf when I get out of college I would be around 22F and he would be 21M. I’m wondering how marriage would change our finances. My sister thinks it would be expensive. We don’t plan on having an expensive wedding or expensive engagement ring. Over talking we decided we would combine all our finances when we marry. Do you think this is a smart move financially and what changes would occur when we combine our finances as a married couple. I heard you get tax benefits for being married so would it be less expensive.

You probably pay just a little less total because your lower salary cushions the speed at which you reached that combined rate. But either way I’m very sure your effective rate is the same.

r3ge29,hmb66di,Is marriage expensive?,ApatheticAbsurdist,11/27/2021,2.0,Being married doesnt cost more per se. Weddings cost a lot. Having a spouse that is bad at money costs a lot.  There are some savings to be had... cohabitating saves money. Depending on what you have for health insurance if one spouse has better health benefits at work that could lead to savings. There can be some tax benefits filing married but its not really as big as many people make out.  But if you have a very expensive wedding that can lead to a lot of debt. And if you mix your finances and the other partner is bad with money... their debt is your debt.  Cohabitate live together without mixing finances and see how it goes. Get to know the inner workings of the other person. Many marriages fail because of incompatible financial attitudes and living together will give you better insight into that. Hopefully everything is great and then you can tie the knot. But I will tell you one thing that is very expensive is divorce.  One other thing Ive learned about relationships (as Im at least twice your age) Ive been with my partner for more than half of your entire life span and it will sound weird but part of the reason we feel we last is that we both are capable of walking away from the relationship. Not that we want to but if we did we wouldnt be here. We know both of us are here because we want to be not because we need to be. If one person is I cant live without you (either emotionally financially or for whatever reason) the relationship becomes imbalanced and that isnt healthy. Having some financial stability to the point where if he wasnt there you could on some level support yourself (even if its painful) helps keep that balance in check.

r3ge29,hmb4gel,Is marriage expensive?,PurpleParrotFish,11/27/2021,3.0,I’m a 22 (almost 23) year old who got married at 21. Marriage is cheaper than being single in many ways. For one rent can be combined and you can easily get a 1 BR apartment instead of a 2 BR typically used in roommate situations. Food is also combined which is cheaper. You can also pull from 2 incomes for big purchases like one car needs replaced or one person has a medical expense. My husband and I recently got a house with a mortgage which we never could have been approved for individually. Plus you will still have one income if one person looses a job or looses income in some way. The advice your sister gave of making sure the other person can support themselves is what my mom said too though. My husband and I did it for a year and it wasn’t worth it. We spent so much extra money on rent just to spend all our time at one apartment or the other. My mom said it’s good to make sure the other person is responsible enough to help provide for the family which is hard to tell if you were both supported by parents before getting married. I do have a cousin who got married at 20 after never living alone before and her husband has never worked consistently since and used his degree. It’s been a huge money struggle for her. They are 30 something now. I think this is the type of situation my mom and your sister worry about.

r3ge29,hmc8oja,Is marriage expensive?,moopuppy1995,11/27/2021,1.0,I HIGHLY recommend that you ALWAYS have a bank account in your own name that your partner does not have access to or maybe even knows about (depending on your situation). I am of the belief that a woman (especially a very young woman like yourself) should always have something in her own name that she can use to support herself. Not to say that your partner is a bad choice but you should always have an out if you need it. What with women typically being left in pretty crap situations if a relationship goes wrong be on the safe side.  To answer your question marriage does not really affect finances unless either of you have secret debt. Sure you get a tax credit but not really enough to make any significant difference.  Honestly I would recommend that you guys graduate move in together and figure out finances and stuff way before you get married. See how that goes for at least a year. And I would highly recommend that you do not join all accounts. I personally believe it is vital to keep some finances separate at all times.  &#x200B  Edit: grammar and additional paragraph
r3ge29,hmcf2ks,Is marriage expensive?,Ameteur_Professional,11/27/2021,2.0,I strongly recommend against waiting until your 30s to get married if you plan on having kids especially multiple.

r3ge29,hmcsbrd,Is marriage expensive?,mrhuddlebucket,11/27/2021,1.0,When my wife and I married we combined everything. Is that the right thing to do? Who knows but it worked for us.  Marriage only really gets expensive if you and your significant other aren’t in step with one another.  Are one of you a saver and one of your a spender? Are both of you spenders? Are both of you savers?  My wife and I are savers. We have kids we expect to put through college and make sure they grow up with more than what we had and we can do that by putting our needs aside and saving. If either of you are spenders this can create conflict with joint finances. Most couples I know parents and in-laws included have at least one spender and happy couple is not the term I would use to describe any of them.  Make sure you’re aligned on your financial needs and goals before marrying or it will become expensive either by one of you wanting a certain lifestyle or one of you wanting out when it’s realized that these types of habits may not be so easily changed.
r3ge29,hmbw3hf,Is marriage expensive?,Buttigieg2032,11/27/2021,1.0,Marriage is expensive if you get divorced and the divorce rate for people who get married earlier than age 25 is absurdly high.
r3ge29,hmb4cj1,Is marriage expensive?,NickOutside,11/27/2021,3.0,Simply getting married isnt expensive just a nominal fee for the paperwork at the courthouse.  Getting divorced can certainly be expensive though. Many people change drastically in their early to mid-20s.  Its not a reason to avoid marriage necessarily but certainly a factor you should consider. Make sure youre ready to get married in general. Money religion children family involvement where you want to live conflict resolution etc... the list goes on and all of it is important in a marriage.   Id recommend pre-marital counseling and taking it seriously. There are paid services like traditional counseling but you can also run through question lists online.

r3ge29,hmc0ary,Is marriage expensive?,kgal1298,11/27/2021,1.0,You do get tax benefits. I think some people have had bad experiences. I married someone who was bad at finances and just about ruined me. With that said many couples get married and start off poor I think the important part is being on the same page with finances and aligning your goals or it can be bad. This is just the truth I’ve lived though it could be different for others. Also if either of you have different incomes id suggest checking some finance channels for how to budget I think the percentage method works the best or it can easily become overwhelming. Either way the point is no marriage isn’t necessarily more expensive than being single as long as you’re aligned and truly partners you can be fine.

The few couples I know off that got married so early in life all ended in horrible divorces.  Maybe reflect about why you want to marry your bf. Development wise you got still some growing up in front of you and wont be the same person in 5 years.  Your sister is right about the financial stability part. You get married and pregnant before having any career. this puts you in a way worse spot than he will be especially regarding childcare.

r3ge29,hmcn7sy,Is marriage expensive?,Pelian_Pines,11/27/2021,4.0,Some deductions do not double if you get married (the SALT deduction for one). The one I see affecting young people the most is the student loan interest deduction. If both people were deducting the max getting married will cut that in half. Also if one person was itemizing and the other was taking the standard deduction their joint return will have a smaller combined deduction. Higher income couples can also run into some issues with investment income tax brackets (which do not double) etc.

The issue that can occur when you get married before ever being truly independent is you have no accurate sense of how hard it is to make it on your own. Its not uncommon in older generations for one partner to leave all the financial management to the other. Lots of men and women who are widowed or divorced suddenly realize they have no idea how their bills are paid what they are or how to budget or they dont have any career history so they have to enter into the workforce at a late age with no experience.

r3ge29,hmak9k2,Is marriage expensive?,uhno28,11/27/2021,3.0,Like others said its what you make it. If one has debt and the other doesnt one person will be going to a worse financial state for example. However theres the upside of sharing expenses like housing bills and groceries which usually tend to be cheaper when shared (like with roommates).  In our case we married while my husband was still in college and I had a couple of years of exp in my field. We didnt spend more than a few hundred on our wedding neither had any debt and we share 100% of the same views on finances saving spending etc so in our case being married has been fantastic including financially. We have combined finances and we can afford a lot more than each of us could individually and when one of us has lost income for some reason weve always been able to withstand it with no problems due to living beneath our means (which is really hard to do when single unless you are making a lot of money ofc) and having the others income to fall back on.  The one thing I can say is that I couldnt imagine being this financially tied to someone if we werent COMPLETELY compatible money-wise. Marrying to someone whos a spender or who needs you to manage all finances because they are like a child with money then that would be a hard no for me.
r3ge29,hmbxnvx,Is marriage expensive?,OneMoreCookie,11/27/2021,1.0,Depends if you want to buy a house and have kids. Otherwise day to day financially it’s no different to living with them unmarried. If you can afford to live together and can afford to do the paperwork for marriage then you can afford to get married. Does that make sense?   If you want to have kids then that’s a different set of financial requirements to work out will one of you stay home for a while? Maternity benefits? Cost of childcare vs wages plus all the other stuff like feeding and housing a child. Similar with buying a house emergency repairs general maintenance fees and rates and what happens if one of you looses their job.

r3ge29,hmcv95r,Is marriage expensive?,mantsz,11/27/2021,1.0,The thing to remember about finances and marriage - especially at your age - is that theres the initial financial impact and then the long-term financial impact to consider. Initially your financial state improves because you consolidate your bills and effectively halve many of them because now youre both pitching into the same pot. This brings a state of perceived financial freedom (comparatively at least). The long-term effect however can be ruinous because in 3-4 years when you realize you got married too young and the other person is no longer the person you fell in love with because theyve grown out of adolescence and into the adult they will be for the rest of their lives you get divorced which ruins your credit and slashes your available income while doubling or in some cases tripling your bills. In the end the best financial advice is just dont get married until youre at least 25 if ever.

r3ge29,hmb643w,Is marriage expensive?,FellowConspirator,11/27/2021,1.0,(In the US) Marriage is not expensive in its own right. The cost of a marriage license is nominal and thats actually the only part of the process (and returning the signed and witnessed document to record the marriage) is the only real expense -- cheaper than dinner in a fancy restaurant. Anything you add to that is your own business.  Theres no real difference with regard to expenses and in fact some expenses can decrease (for example employer-sponsored benefits are generally cheaper for employee+spouse than they are for each employee too separately get benefits from their respective employers). Once you are married you are a team. You tend to have joint responsibility for your household (finances and otherwise) and enjoy a litany of legal rights with respect to property powers of attorney and other things which can be financially beneficial in many circumstances if they come up.  Whether or not you combine your finances explicitly or not you should be mindful that they become legally intertwined in various ways by marriage regardless (in some states more so than others). The extent to which you keep things separate is really a matter of personal choice and discipline. You will increasingly take on shared responsibility for debts and regular payments together.  My wife and I have our finances joined aside from tax-advantaged retirement accounts which dont support that (though we are primary beneficiaries of one another on our respective plans). All of our bills are paid from a shared pool our investments are in a shared pool all of our real estate is shared etc. In 25 years this has worked pretty well.
r3ge29,hmawalj,Is marriage expensive?,Icy-Regular1112,11/27/2021,6.0,I tend to agree with your sister but not for the same reasons exactly. People change a LOT between 22 and 32. Sometimes you can get married and change together in the same way(s) and sometimes you change and move apart. I generally recommend getting into your 30s before getting married or buying a house for that reason. Flexibility and the ability to grow into yourself and your career is important. For example if you get offered your dream job across the country and your spouse has their dream job already it can really hurt your finances (and your life satisfaction) because someone has to sacrifice their full potential.   Sharing expenses being married assuming both parties are on the same page and have good earnings will ultimately yield financial benefits (mostly by paying half on fixed costs like utilities and rent) but marrying young can have real downsides to career and growth opportunities.
r3ge29,hmcx2uf,Is marriage expensive?,classicalL,11/27/2021,1.0,Your sister doesnt sound like she should get married honestly. If you cannot rely on someone and have very little trust in them you really probably arent mature enough or into the core ideas of what a marriage is enough to get married...  As to the fiscal aspects it can be beneficial in the US if you have unequal incomes because it will basically average the income. Take the extreme example of not being married but living together and one person isnt working and the other is making 150 k/year. Then your marginal tax rate is 12% ([https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/](https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/)) while filing single one person paid no tax but the other had a marginal tax rate of 24%. So you saved something like 8000 a year in Federal income tax in this case. If you both make exactly the same income then it doesnt make much income tax difference to be married and file jointly. Of course you risk your assets might get caught up if you divorce if you are significantly wealthier than your partner... So there are lots of things to think about.
r3ge29,hmcn0hk,Is marriage expensive?,funklab,11/27/2021,72.0,>That said your sister isn’t wrong about also being able to stand alone.

r3ge29,hmcls62,Is marriage expensive?,WaftIt,11/27/2021,1.0,Heres my experience having married my college sweetheart.  I hope it helps someone!  Weve been together for 10 years married for 5.  We were together for 2 years in college and moved to the same city after graduation. He went into a phd program immediately after graduating I went to work i the private sector.  We lived with roommates and I came up with the number I felt we needed for a modest wedding in our area and an emergency fund.  Then I got to work paying off my student loans (he had no debt leaving undergrad).  I shared my savings plans and laid out a potential time table.  About two years after graduation I met my goals and proposed.  Neither of us are diamond people so we picked out simple matching engagement rings that cost ~$150 each.  We timed our wedding to coincide with the end of our leases when we were 26 to ensure that I could get him on my health insurance before he had to get off of his parents.  He moved in about a week before the wedding and we combined our finances though we do each have an account that is in our own name.    We use YNAB to track our expenses and fill in a net worth spreadsheet every month.  That works well for us as a system for transparency and creating opportunities for communication about money.  Whether or not filing as married gets you a tax break depends on a number of factors.  Living together and combining your finances impacts you financially in significant ways beyond taxes but it is all down to how the couple choose to live as a unit.  My husband and I are both savers but we help each other let go a bit and spend on things that make us happy.

r3ge29,hmcvjdk,Is marriage expensive?,SteeztheSleaze,11/27/2021,1.0,You’ve gotten a lot of feedback but as others have said for one dual incomes make a huge difference.   I can’t afford to live alone in my hometown. When I had a girlfriend we split rent and did pretty well. Then if we got married she could use my insurance and we’d save on that unless hers was better then I could help pay for my share on hers. Then there’s tax benefits etc.   You don’t have to go crazy with a big wedding if you don’t want to. A lot of my friends got married on paper then had a wedding once they and their families could afford it. Just a thought

r3ge29,hmbf2wu,Is marriage expensive?,invenio78,11/27/2021,4.0,Most people when they get married will share ownership of assets.  Like their house cars bank accounts brokerage accounts.  Thus one one spouse gets sued these will be all fair game.  Also risk doesnt necessarily come with occupation.  The mail man slip on your front porch and sues you for $2 million...  I guess you could make really complicated asset separation to try and keep assets separate but 50% on each side but even then you are basically back to the original risk of being not married.  Marriage innately does not give asset protection that two unmarried people wouldnt intrinsically have.

That said I found out my husband still had $35K in student loans to pay off when we got engaged (I had $0 - mine were already paid). I told him those needed to be 100% paid off before the wedding. It took some sacrifices on his part but he had them paid off in full about three months before the wedding. That wasnt debt I was willing to take on.   How marriage plays out financially is really situation-dependent. My advice is to always have your own money accessible only to you. Its just good sense in case theres an emergency or things go sideways for some reason. My good friend worked in banking for years and there were too many times that a couple on the brink of divorce had one spouse come clean out the account leaving the other one high and dry. You never want to be in that situation. *Always* have emergency funds in an account *only* in your name.

r3ge29,hmbryow,Is marriage expensive?,El_Zoid0,11/27/2021,1.0,Not married but after watching in sickness and for worse with my own eyes theres a lot to think about especially in the post covid times not to mention how your lives will change after college.  My mother had to go through the court system for conservatorship for my dad after he fell ill and couldnt do shit for himself. We were turning him every two hours and feeding him through a G-tube replacing his condom catheter deep suctioning his tracheostomy. For 3.5 years until he died. This shit is marriage too. You gotta talk about what happens if you get COVID or in a car accident all that then put it on paper have witnesses so there arent fights when someones in the hospital or over property when the worst happens. If you do end up marrying get conservatorship and your advanced directives in order.  If you guys are in decent majors and can be gainfully employed soon after accumulate wealth pay off college debts then think about a wedding. Just because you love him doesnt mean you need to let your guard down. My mother always emphasized being stable alone was the pathway to independence. You guys will be stronger together overall and alleviate stress in your relationship if both of you are better off financially independently.  Theres no reason you cant play house before getting married either. Youll still learn how to live with each other outside the drama and confines of college life all while saving on rent and planning that wedding.   So what are you rushing for? A marriage or a party?   Also you can keep wedding costs down by doing a courthouse wedding or having a personal friend who is licensed to marry you. Skip the church location and have both ceremony and reception at the same spot. Just go into it knowing you might be upcharged for a venue if the word wedding comes up.  If you need a personal rec for a high end photographer lmk but if you want nice professional photos hire someone thats not your friend/fam that has their own website. If you wanna cut on expenses in photography you can look to find someone who will do only digital and will send you all the raw images for you so do what you wish. Make sure you find someone that goes over the ultimate shot checklist.    Remember its a party so get creative and savvy wherever you can.

r3ge29,hmcqvv8,Is marriage expensive?,robertluke,11/27/2021,0.0,A wedding is expensive but being married isn’t.   I don’t recommend combining finances. You have your account and credit cards and he has his. It solves a lot of fights. I don’t need to see what my wife spends on nails and she doesn’t see when I buy a videogame. It’s not a secret but we don’t see that amount subtracted from “our” account.   I do feel more financially secure after being married and buying a house.

r3ge29,hmc583n,Is marriage expensive?,porcelainvacation,11/27/2021,3.0,My wife and I got married straight out of undergrad. Were still together 22 years later- our only mistake was our timing. She was emancipated from her parents and getting great financial aid. I got a lucrative job just out of undergrad bought a house and my company paid for my graduate tuition. She wanted to go to grad school too. Then reality hit- as a married couple we made too much money for her to get grants but we also didnt have any savings yet. She still went to grad school but the decision to get married probably cost us $40k in grants. We delayed having children by 10 years while we paid off that debt. Financially we would have been way better off waiting until we both finished grad school to get married.
r3ge29,hmcx3sx,Is marriage expensive?,mrlazyboy,11/27/2021,1.0,In terms of price my wife and I got married at the local courthouse and went out to dinner after with our families.

r3ge29,hmacxna,Is marriage expensive?,prettyplum32,11/27/2021,24.0,Marriage is simply a contract where you combine two people into one legal unit.   This means for taxes it’s not your income it’s both of your income (although you can also file married separately). This means you have access to each other’s benefits at work. It means you have automatic beneficiary designations for life insurance/retirement accounts/medical and end of life decisions. It means anything bought (big stuff like houses worthless stuff like silverware) legally belong to both of you.   Marriage itself is not expensive or cheap it completely depends on your own situations. Some people end up paying more in taxes after marriage some end up paying less. Some people’s spouses take out credit cards in their name in secret some people’s spouses are financially literate. It just totally depends.   The fact that you’ve asked this to me means you don’t have the requisite life experience needed to decide who and when to marry yet. Move in together if you want live as actual adults for a while before you decide. Marriage is very easy to do and very very expensive to undo. You don’t want to rush into it.
r3ge29,hmae2m9,Is marriage expensive?,NoFilterNoLimits,11/27/2021,50.0,My husband and I rely on each other and built what we have as a team.  If we’d waited to be completely self sufficient independently we might still not be married 😝.  We wanted a teammate not an independent roommate we had sex with  Mutually attacking financial goals as a team has been much more beneficial than trying to do it separately next to each other IMHO
r3ge29,hmbltin,Is marriage expensive?,dont_know_me_anymore,11/27/2021,2.0,The most important thing is teamwork. What do you each want your life to look like financially? What happens when you have kids? How do you want to prioritize saving for retirement and emergencies? Stuff like that. My husband and I admittedly didn’t discuss our finances enough before we got married or even early on in our marriage. As a result we did end up with more debt than we should’ve and not as much retirement savings as we could’ve if we’d just sat down and really talked things through better. It’s easy to not worry or talk much about money when the bills are always getting paid but you can get a false sense of security in that position. It took us probably 8 years of marriage before we really worked together to achieve common goals rather than just make sure the bills were paid.
r3ge29,hmbo279,Is marriage expensive?,LittleGirlTeethMeme,11/27/2021,3.0,I would gently suggest living together and not getting married until age 25+. Lots of evidence that our brains are still maturing until around age 25 and marriage failure rate is significantly higher in those who marry before age 25 vs. those who marry at 25+. You’ll also likely be more financially secure by that age or at least have an idea of some major life goals/career trajectory (might be done with any formal education etc.). Divorce can be VERY expensive. Avoid it if you can!

r3ge29,hmam9xg,Is marriage expensive?,Annabel398,11/27/2021,20.0,The sister’s advice reminds me of a zillion Twitter threads that begin with someone bemoaning divorce: “our grandparents stayed together for life why don’t we?” and end with dozens if not hundreds of women replying “granny took me aside and told me ‘always have some money of your own so you can get out of a bad marriage if you need to’” (interspersed with a couple of tales of granny ditching or even offing abusive gramps and going on to live her best life).   It’s not always about the money… but money is a tool and it can fix or at least help a lot of problems.
r3ge29,hmcyhjy,Is marriage expensive?,MaRy3195,11/27/2021,2.0,This is definitely an important point. My (now) husband and I got engaged a few months after graduating college but then waited almost 2 years for the actual wedding. By thst point we both had stable income careers and savings. Plus we were able to live together and make some big financial decisions together (picking apartments buying a car buying a house etc). So by the time we actually got married we were very confident in our ability to both support ourselves individually and make decisions together. Its definitely ok to marry young but consider a long engagement maybe to sort some of these items out.
r3ge29,hmcrb1b,Is marriage expensive?,LivelikeJune_2021,11/27/2021,1.0,I would say your asking the wrong question. Marriage is as expensive as you want it to be like life.  Divorces can also be expensive. That is awfully young to get married. But everyone is different. You and your future partner have to be on the same page. You should never pressure someone into marriage. If you marry right away will you be able to have your own place to live in. Stuff like this matters for the relationship. I thought I would get married earlier but we waited until he was 30 and I was 29 and we were more financially stable and could finally have our own place with no roomates. Most importantly if you do get married that young it would be great if you have parents that can help you because life is expensive and having support from family. Also pay attention to what your partners family is like they will be your family too. 💕
r3ge29,hmabm8z,Is marriage expensive?,Thelton26,11/27/2021,7.0,Marriage like most anything else can be as expensive as you want it to be. And whether or not youre married you are both buying food paying rent and utilities etc. The wedding itself and the ring can be extremely expensive but youve already talked about that and want it to be reasonable.  As far as combining finances I personally think its a good idea. It keeps you on the same page and there wont be any debates about my money and your money or one of you paying for something. The money is both of yours and goes into a pool.
r3ge29,hmced5e,Is marriage expensive?,Ameteur_Professional,11/27/2021,2.0,I wont disagree that theres no need to rush but also not everyone is going to want to wait 10 years.  Marriage can be a very important legal and financial prerequisite to a lot of things. Marriage comes with a lot of tangible benefits and if you want to marry someone theres no reason to wait 10 years because your 20s is so early  The way OP phrased their comment sounds like theyre at least entertaining the possibility of kids (based on their comment of their sister not wanting them) and especially if you want several kids it generally makes a lot more sense to start in your 20s rather than your 30s.  Most people consider marriage as something they want before having kids as well as often something to do before buying a house with someone.  OP should get married when they truly believe this is the person they want to spend their life with and are ready to commit to that.

r3ge29,hmadzhc,Is marriage expensive?,Riza101z,11/27/2021,-7.0,I understand we might wait longer to marry because he’d still be in college but we will probably still get married young. By the time I graduate we would be together for 5 years and we were already talking about getting married half a year in our relationship so it just makes sense to even though we are still young. I know a lot of people aren’t as lucky as we are though
r3ge29,hmcz43h,Is marriage expensive?,phoenixmatrix,11/27/2021,2.0,Weddings can be cheap. Just dont give in to the peer pressure of the family who will want you to invite 400 people and go over the time. Its your day not theirs. Im fairly well off and we still spend less than 1 month worth of income on our wedding and easily could have spent much much less.     As for finances getting mixed since youre really young you may want to sign a prenup agreement. You dont know if one of you may hit it off and become wildly more successful than the other. Then since people change maybe things dont work out and now one of you get completely screwed (this will depend on the laws of the state youre in of course). It may not be the most romantic thing in the world but IMO its the responsible thing to do.     Do consider having separate accounts so you can keep some level of financial independence. Not only will it make it easier to get out if things go to hell but it also makes it a lot easier to hide birthday presents )     Then if you want a joint account on top of that make it clear ahead of time how much of your incomes will go in it vs how much you keep for yourself.

r3ge29,hmcgw19,Is marriage expensive?,jsboutin,11/27/2021,1.0,Marriage is a pretty low financial impact.

r3ge29,hmcl7ia,Is marriage expensive?,daaamber,11/27/2021,2.0,My mom was trapped in a marriage that made her miserable. She was a SAHM with no more than a high school degree and only fast food or maid jobs under her belt. My dad also controlled what she could spend. So often had clothing in poor condition because it was not in the budget for her to buy new clothes -we got new clothing.  She made it very clear to me that I needed to have my own career and financial stability so I’d never be trapped. Its also good to have your own account so no one can control your spending. I imagine your sister has that lens.  Joint accounts should be for joint expenses or joint decisions only (home car food vacations). If you both have an income the remainder is up to you.
r3ge29,hmb2cly,Is marriage expensive?,Extreme_Tomorrow2233,11/27/2021,3.0,Make sure it’s the right person and you really want to spend the rest of your life together and grow old together.  Otherwise shortly after college is not a big deal.  We got married when we were your age we are happily married decades later.   Having a common understanding of finances is important as is having a common understanding of other important aspects of your lives like whether to have kids your values etc.  Your understanding of whether to fully join finances or keep them relatively separate (eg joint vs separate bank accounts) would be pretty important.  We take an approach of what either of us is fully jointly owned which worked when my SO was the bread winner and also when I became the bread winner.    With regard to credit cards though — I think you are right if you pay off cards every month then credit cards are likely the optimal route (liability protection 2%+ back sign-up bonuses that can be over $1k).  I’d say marriage does not need to be expensive — it’s more having children that is expensive (potential loss of income child care need for bigger house or in good school district private school / college etc.).  But also a great joy.
r3ge29,hmbse6t,Is marriage expensive?,freeman1231,11/27/2021,1.0,Marriage is not expensive… living together isn’t any more expensive then living alone in fact most times it’s cheaper since you are pooling money together for something.  What can be expensive is weddings engagement rings and kids. If you don’t plan to go crazy on these items like you mentioned then no marriage is not expensive.

r3ge29,hmb8e5u,Is marriage expensive?,Topher_86,11/27/2021,2.0,It’s not expensive— just risky.  I would see marrying that young as a financial risk. Brain development continues to around age 25 or so tying financially to another person before this point could be disastrous as there is ample room in the development window for a person to change. Upsides are minimal as at such a young age the majority of people will likely have few assets if not in debt already.  It’s a reasonable conclusion to think the most someone will take on is the others’ debts at such a young age. Essentially the risk-vs-reward isn’t there.

If you are going to get married and *stay* married (everyone thinks they will) then marriage can be a big boost to your finances.

Whether thats a personal bank account or just a wad of cash stuffed in the bra drawer. It helps you stay out of the situation where you cant afford to leave a partner. I think this might be what your sister is referring to.   Other than that the finances of marriage arent much different from just living together but you may get a slight tax break if you file jointly. Plus fixed expenses like rent can be halved since you are sharing them with another person almost like having a roommate.
r3ge29,hmbjqj7,Is marriage expensive?,OvereducatedCritic,11/27/2021,1.0,I wont disagree with you on that marriage is a force multiplier but I will say its a risk for both people from the jump. People change and you wont always see why. On top of that I feel like its hard to make life decisions/big financial decisions without the second party present. I would sooner opt for me vs the world since its less complicated and Im not risking my assets or anyone elses when Im married to someone I dont know fully/am sued for an arbitrary amount of money or for my assets. A teammate can just as quickly become an enemy or a liability if they have ulterior motives/ dont communicate/ are good at lying/get sick/...the list goes on.  Creating a unit means you go down with the ship you built and from what I have been reading those repairs(divorce) are wildly expensive. I think its a smarter decision to pursue full financial independence because that money will make/break you no matter what.

If theyre unwilling to let you know everything in advance even if they used to have a problem that theyve overcome (which often comes from growing up in a financially irresponsible family) it will become an issue in your marriage. On the positive if youre completely on the same page financially and stay that way then the only expensive thing will be a big wedding (unless you can get your family to pay for it...or elope).

r3ge29,hmc9196,Is marriage expensive?,TheophrastBombast,11/27/2021,0.0,Maybe the person making less money could technically pay more than they would have otherwise. Taxes are typically taken out of each pay check ahead of time so maybe more taxes are taken out to cover the higher tax brackets. Maybe they would expect a big tax return but now that doesnt happen. Or maybe their partner didnt get as much tax withheld as they should have and now they have to use their savings to pay their owed taxes and they do it equally but in really one was paying more taxes the whole year and now has to cover half the others bill.      Granted that doesnt really matter if you combine income into a single account but if they do it in another way it could skew the balance.

r3ge29,hmazeh1,Is marriage expensive?,unbalancedcheckbook,11/27/2021,1.0,There are certain marriage penalties in the tax code so dont expect to save on taxes unless your income levels are wildly different.  Anyway dont do it or not do it for financial reasons. IMO  the main reason to get married (as opposed to just moving in together and agreeing to share everything) is that it legally codifies your relationship.  If youre legally in the grey zone between single and married things can be a lot more complicated when it comes to property ownership children medical authority etc.   That said Im not saying to rush in either... Just that the idea that you should be financially independent first is not really that relevant.   Sharing living expenses is a great thing to do financially however.   If you have one dwelling instead of two you will make a lot more headway in your financial goals.

r3ge29,hmcny5o,Is marriage expensive?,BrightNooblar,11/27/2021,1.0,Marriage impacts taxes but not always the way you want. \*in general\* in one person makes the majority of the money its a gain for taxes. If each partner makes about the same you pay more overall as a married couple.     That said the question becomes Is it worth a 2% tax penalty to say youre married? If the answer is yes its for money do what you want. I bought a computer fan with cool lights. I could have gone with a boring fan but I was okay paying a bit more for a thing that made you happy. If getting married makes you happy do it.
r3ge29,hmboq04,Is marriage expensive?,throwaway1937725,11/27/2021,1.0,You’re not giving a lot of details here - like your income or expenses.

r3ge29,hmcwhbb,Is marriage expensive?,PrayingMantisMirage,11/27/2021,4.0,I would suggest you have some joint accounts and some separate. Perhaps a joint checking account for shared bills a joint savings for saving. Then personal checking & savings. This gives you a good backup in case things ever do go wrong and you need a nest egg of your own to start your life over. It may be hard to envision things going wrong but having access to your own money can be crucial. IMO better to be safe than sorry. And that way you can both have your own fun money to spend on individual hobbies vices etc without annoying each other over spending joint money on it.

r3ge29,hmbchfd,Is marriage expensive?,cm253,11/27/2021,13.0,This needs to be higher.  Marriage is cheap cheaper than two people being single.  Divorce is expensive.  Its costs are not only financial but the financial costs are high.  Marry because you want to be married not for any perceived financial benefit.  Stay single because its the right choice for you not because you think marriage is too expensive.  My husband any I spent about $1000 on our marriage rings included.  Still together 12 years later.

r3ge29,hmawp3g,Is marriage expensive?,boredprogrammerguy,11/27/2021,2.0,My wife and I got married at 23/22 almost immediately out of college. Wedding was under $5k most of which we got back in practical gifts for our new apartment together. Engagement ring was only $1400 wedding bands were under $500 each. and honestly looking back we should have done non traditional rings and saved a couple thousand but hey at least it wasn’t a $10000 ring budget I guess.  Your sister has some weird ideas about marriage. I agree that you should not marry someone for financial reasons but working together to pay bills isn’t exclusive to marriage. Just make sure once you’re married all of your financial goals are in alignment. It’s no longer “your” and “my” money but “our” money.
r3ge29,hmcuhkb,Is marriage expensive?,latitude11,11/27/2021,1.0,Sharing 100% of your finances is a poor move. Each partner should hold separate accounts and keep some $ in just your name while also paying into a joint account for combined expenses.

r3ge29,hmcp99t,Is marriage expensive?,Pelian_Pines,11/27/2021,3.0,If you pay more in taxes it’s not because of the brackets. Your scenario is actually one where you save money by getting married.  Being in a tax bracket doesnt mean you pay that federal income tax rate on everything you make. You pay 10 percent of the first $20000 you make 12 percent of the next $60000 you make 22 percent of the next $100000 you make etc.  Since the married bracket is double the single bracket you still pay the same amount on your income. And your husband will pay less than he did before because he gets to use the spare room in your bracket before hitting the bracket he was in before.  Look up marginal tax rates for a much better explanation of this.
r3ge29,hmc4jjj,Is marriage expensive?,playdateslevi,11/27/2021,1.0,Getting married is not expensive and weddings even great ones don’t have to be. But I would HIGHLY recommend not combining your finances fully.   I’d determine how much you need for rent bills groceries dates/couple activities and other joint expenses and both pay into that fund as well as joint savings for larger expenses down the line like vacations and housing.   Having individual financial accounts allows for a degree of healthy privacy/individualism but paying into a shared fund still allows for a healthy degree of accountability.
r3ge29,hmc2dp9,Is marriage expensive?,Gilbert_Sanchez,11/27/2021,2.0,Mmm I mean it’s expensive where your spouses issues are you issues. Like if your spouse gets sick you have to protect them in that situation along with yourself. You are their family now.   It’s cheap though cause their money is your money. Like I make ok money on my own but with my wife we make a ton of money. So it cuts both ways I think.   But I agree with your sisters idea. You need to be a full person on your own: emotionally physically financially etc before you’re married.

Money Guy is better for those trying to be as efficient as possible. Tons of overlap in philosophy though.

r3ge29,hmbifv4,Is marriage expensive?,2021istrash,11/27/2021,0.0,The problem isnt the wedding its that you will also want a baby or accidentally  get pregnant. Then you will have to stay at home caring for the baby and you will be baby trapped. Why? Because right after college and a few years after you probably wont make much money and you will be fully depending on your husband making money and therefore be trapped financially. No woman or man should ever be trapped that way unable to leave a bad relationship because of money  Everyone should have a certain degree of financial freedom before and during the marriage. Sure once can take 6mo maternity leave and rely on them for a bit but realistically your career wont take off right after college and getting married and much less is having a baby early on.  Also its nice to have some savings for emergencies in case one of you falls sick and for proper vacations. If you want to ruin a marriage fast being broke and having a baby early on are the easiest ways to do this.

r3ge29,hmbe6hp,Is marriage expensive?,joelmole79,11/27/2021,1.0,I did not have my financial house in order until I got married but I also married someone who was responsible.  This said don’t expect marriage to change someone in that regard. If they have bad financial habits and/or are not a high earner consider the likelihood that this will continue into marriage. That is the part that is really expensive along with divorce. Raising a family buying a house and lifestyle creep is also very expensive. But these are things you potentially do to build the life you want.  Once you are married and especially if you have kids you now have obligations to people other than yourself. These obligations are costly but can spur you to take more responsibility for your future if you have a good head on your shoulders. I don’t think I would have been motivated to advance my career without this kick in the butt.  But above all you need to make sure you talk honestly about priorities with your partner and the sort of life you are striving to build and make sure you are on the same sheet of music.  It’s easy to get into a situation where you’ve committed your time talents and treasure to borrow a turn of phrase to something that you doesn’t bring you happiness. Time is the most precious commodity so guard that and use it wisely above all else.

r3ge29,hmcni82,Is marriage expensive?,moopuppy1995,11/27/2021,13.0,Yeah. The human brain does not fully develop until 25-27 years old. I would really recommend you just wait a few years. Graduate move in together actually develop a life where finances exist with job careers etc. See what works for you guys once you are in the real world. It may sound harsh but I dont think a 21 and 22 year old are usually experienced enough to have regular finances (maybe you are different I dont know). I have been with my partner since we were 16 and we did not get married until 24/25 and I still think we were a little young. I love him and am glad we are together but there is NO rush. And to be honest with you getting my drivers license was a bigger change than getting married. We were already established with separate careers finances etc. and just worked on figuring out what worked for us. We still are by the way. Marriage does not make life cheaper for us though.
r3ge29,hmcml78,Is marriage expensive?,not_a_moogle,11/27/2021,1.0,in theory you get a bigger tax return filing as a couple but its more like it averages it out. so instead of one person getting a return and another person owing is that you combined get a return thats slightly better that the net change of the two separately.  Child credits though make a big difference.  That said being married is not inherently more expensive and assuming youre living together and splitting bills itll be cheaper.. also assuming youre careful with your budget.  Its a double edged sword though since youre both liabable for each others debts and that can bite you in the ass.  ... Not financial advice but at 22/21 youre still figuring out your live and you will be very different people at 25 and very different people from at at 30.  theres other implications that youre not considering.

r3ge29,hmbkxmw,Is marriage expensive?,tenaciouslyteetering,11/27/2021,7.0,Similarly my standing advice is to wait until youve both lived independently (including with a roommate that isnt each other) before getting married.  You change when you first move out. And if you move straight from your family home to living with a partner its easy to slip into an unhealthy someone-is-the-child dynamic.   Before living on ones own its hard to actually know if they are clean if they can pay bills on time and more. Taking care of your room and finances without bills is not the same.

r3ge29,hmc15u2,Is marriage expensive?,Agling,11/27/2021,2.0,Being married isnt expensive at all. Its cheaper than being single on a number of levels. Having kids is expensive. Also depending on how you do it the actual marriage event can be expensive. But those are separate choices from the actual choice to get married.  There are lots of ways to handle finance when you are married and everyone does it a little differently. There really isnt a right way. You just have to be compatible and be on the same page.  The other thing that is expensive is divorce. Make sure you arent setting yourself up for that. If you are confident then marriage is a wise financial move.

I understand that credit cards are very dangerous if you dont have any self control over spending BUT if you are financially normal/stable there are so many benefits to credit cards paid off every month (ie never paying interest).  * Building your credit score!!!!!! * Reward points/cashback/miles * Price drop protection * Rental car insurance * chargebacks/fraud detection (as compared to a debit card) * Automatic accounting (when linking your credit cards to an online budget tool like mint personal capital YNAB etc
r3ge29,hmaqz85,Is marriage expensive?,gammaradiation2,11/27/2021,2.0,Marriage can be as cheap as filing for the license. Marriage can have tax benefits especially if one earns way more than the other. Marriage makes access and power of attorney much easier in medical emergencies.   Marriage legally is just a step above domestic partnership.  You do not need to be self sustaining before getting married. In fact in most HCOL areas that rarely happens. At least if you consider self sustaining renting without roommates.

r3ge29,hmby4fr,Is marriage expensive?,Claffstar,11/27/2021,1.0,Is marriage expensive? No.  Life is expensive.  Weddings CAN be expensive.  I would at a minimum make sure I had a few basic needs in place before I got married though. Job health insurance do I have enough money for food clothing and shelter? Money problems can put MAJOR stress on a marriage.  I would also live with my partner for a year or 2 before I got married. Nothing wrong with making sure you can live with someone before you marry them.
r3ge29,hmcr4qq,Is marriage expensive?,arparris,11/27/2021,1.0,I got married at 21 and we joined finances.  Our wedding cost us $3k because the first thing her POS father in law said when we told him we were engaged was that he wasn’t paying for it.  (Nothing to do with us rushing or me being bad he’s just a genuinely bad person).  Marrying her was the best thing I ever did for my finances.  We balance each other and she’s the one that got me started on investing when I was in grad school and she was working to put me through.  Now I work and she stays at home with our infant and will continue to do so until he’s school aged.    The caveat here is that you have to have the right person and be like minded in your goals (or at least have enough give and take to be able to compromise where no one feels like they are losing).

r3ge29,hmcsaqn,Is marriage expensive?,crimxxx,11/27/2021,1.0,Well from an idea stand point you save money cause you can split housing costs like you would with a roommate and you can consolidate certain individual things to either be one (like say a car if you can work that out)  or buy in bulk for food. Basically there can definitely be pluses here. And depending where you live sometimes the government lets you get certain tax advantages unless you know for sure u have that I would assume nine though.  The flip side is if you can’t come to an agreement on how money is saved and spent you’ll probably get a divorce. Money is one of the leading causes of splitting up. What one side thinks is acceptable does not always line up and that can very easily result in being in a very poor financial situation.  On the other hand

This isnt a hard and fast rule but people commonly get married at an older age. I suggest cohabiting first. Hopefully you will find him to be a good partner. But its best to be sure.  > I’m wondering how marriage would change our finances. My sister thinks it would be expensive. We don’t plan on having an expensive wedding or expensive engagement ring.  Your plan is a good one IMO.  > Over talking we decided we would combine all our finances when we marry. Do you think this is a smart move financially and what changes would occur when we combine our finances as a married couple. I heard you get tax benefits for being married so would it be less expensive.  Not being American Im not qualified to talk about US taxes. (Im assuming youre American I could be wrong.)  But I would not totally combine finances. I think each of you should have your own checking account and a combined checking account for combined expenses. Each paycheck/direct deposit goes into your own account. Transfer enough money to pay for rent/mortgage and other shared expenses. You should each have your own credit card and perhaps be authorized users on each others account.  Why have your own account? So you can surprise your husband to be with a nice gift (and ditto for him). Or you can spend a bit of money on a hobby he thinks is silly (and ditto for him) without an argument. Or because someones account got frozen due to fraud or a bank screwup and now you have a backup. Or theres a death or divorce. You cant see the future so its best to have a backup that you hopefully will never need.  Sharing living expenses is in of itself a great cost savings regardless of the tax rules :)
r3ge29,hmayje3,Is marriage expensive?,Varathien,11/27/2021,2.0,Marriage doesnt have to cost anything. Well a few dollars in court paperwork.   Weddings can range from the affordable to the ludicrously expensive.   Divorce is incredibly expensive. It sounds like youre already doing a good job at talking about things like combining your finances.

r3ge29,hmbuxm6,Is marriage expensive?,SuchLovelyLilacs,11/27/2021,1.0,I think thats situation-dependent. My BIL and SIL recently divorced after 24 years of marriage. At the time of their divorce they had just one minor child and had shared custody so no child support. BIL has a successful career in marketing. SIL has had a spotty work history over her life and no real career trajectory. BIL is paying SIL alimony for 10 years. Kind of crappy IMO but she did support him as he climbed the career ladder. So SIL was 46 when they divorced. Shes been unemployed/underemployed for the past 2 years and basically living on the alimony. She now has 8 years of alimony left no appreciable retirement savings and no real career prospects. Her alimony will run out when she is 56. Not sure what kind of job shell find at 56 or if shell find one at all. I feel she basically shot herself in the foot with this divorce financially.  OTOH my BIL continues to work in his field has gotten a promotion and a substantial raise in the past 2 years. He will most likely continue to work earning a six-figure salary for the next 15-20 years. He has healthy retirement savings purchased a home outright. His daughter is already graduated from college (already paid for) and his two sons have opted not to go to college. Basically hes sittin pretty financially for the rest of his days barring any kind of illness or disability (for which he has insurance).   I really fear for how things are going to pan out for my SIL in the long-term unless she remarries (which she may well do).

r3pm4w,hmd2q8x,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,jkh107,11/27/2021,10.0,The rule of thumb is that routine screenings (most of them on a certain list) are preventive but if they FIND something anything further becomes diagnostic and subject to deductible and cost sharing.

r3pm4w,hmd1f6k,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,thisisnotawar,11/27/2021,7.0,You can certainly call your doctor and ask if they will reduce the cost if you pay in full. If not tell them that you can’t afford to pay it - they will likely be willing to put you on an interest-free payment plan. I have known people paying as little as $10/month on huge medical bills they’ll be paying for a very long time but no interest will be charged and at least theoretically these bills should have impact on credit.

If the doctor saw the abnormal EKG and didnt do the echo and you ended up with some form of carditis (myo peri epi etc.)  it could be bad. But like others have said its not a routine exam so its not covered on a routine check up so itll go towards meeting your deductible.
r3pm4w,hmcus8l,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,mcarneybsa,11/27/2021,8.0,Thats exactly what it is. We found a problem/abnormality lets treat/look into it = no longer preventive care.

r3pm4w,hmcyzh2,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,WizardofOssification,11/27/2021,-2.0,The EKG is covered but there is a lot of conflicting data on whether routine preventative EKGs do anything helpful in the absence of symptoms or specific risk factors.  But since they found a “problem” the echo will not qualify for preventative coding.   May be worth declining EKGs in the future for regular preventative things. Insurances may pay for it but not helpful clinically for screening if low risk and recommended against getting by the national preventative health body.   https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography

r3pm4w,hmcqjtk,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,ChaoticSquirrel,11/27/2021,93.0,Only preventative care is covered in your wellness exam. Once it becomes diagnostic or involves treating a condition it ceases to become preventative and thus is not free of charge to you.
r3pm4w,hmd1xnk,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,DoomBuggE,11/27/2021,6.0,That’s not how this works at all. Most plans cover routine preventative care (annual GP visit x 1 annual Gyn visit x 1 for women limited family planning limited basic lab work like cholesterol screening) without the deductible applying. Your deductible applies for just about everything else though outside of that extremely limited scope.  Young healthy folks may only need routine care for much of the time. However if you get sick injure yourself or have some other abnormal work up such as this EKG/echo situation that’s when you need to hit your deductible first.  I’m amazed reading through these comments how many people here have no idea how insurance works.
r3pm4w,hmd5j7a,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,DoomBuggE,11/27/2021,8.0,Ah I can see how this is confusing to you then. The US is very different from the UK.  The out of pocket costs for care here in the US are astronomical. I am a big believer in low or no deductible plans for this reason even if you’re relatively healthy. You never know when sh** is going to happen!  Here in the US you get an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) that will outline the costs of all of your care by line item and then you get an actual bill from your insurance carrier showing those charges vs what was actually covered and how much you actually owe.  My daughter was admitted to the hospital for 5 days and her EOB said the out of pocket cost for the stay was over $50000. I have a no deductible plan no coinsurance plan so I only owed a copay of $250 which is the flat fee I pay for any hospital admission. I paid the same for when I was in labor (despite many MANY complications and an emergency C section) and I think my EOB for my daughter’s delivery was also pretty high definitely over $30000.  I have a friend who had a pretty bad form of cancer and he luckily also has an excellent insurance plan. The EOB for one month of extensive autologous bone marrow transplant treatment was over $1 million. Because of his insurance I think he only paid $1000 of that. Lucky for his insurance because it saved his life.  People are really in to HSAs here but I schedule Gyn surgeries and therefore I find myself explaining costs and coverage to folks all the time and some of these high deductible plans are just outrageous. Imagine needing a $15-20K surgery and realizing your deductible is $8000 with a 40% coinsurance (meaning you pay $8K and anything above and beyond that your plan only covers 60%). At that point you might as well not have insurance at all.
r3pm4w,hmcsuto,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,dmxwidget,11/27/2021,28.0,You will have the same issue/problem/experience with other insurance providers.   Until you hit your deductible many aspects of your care will be paid out of pocket and then once you hit your out of pocket max insurance will cover 100% of costs.    Those numbers will vary from plan to plan.

Youre not any more or less diversified than if you had one or the other.  Its not diversified compared to a total market fund but the performance of the S&P and the entire market has been nearly identical over the past couple decades so what youve got isnt the worst thing in the world. I definitely wouldnt create a taxable event and reset the long term gains clock by selling one for the other.  You may wish to put future investments into VTSAX *or* SWTSX to be invested in the total market. VTIAX *or* SWISX would give you some international exposure.
r3pawf,hmc5y5k,VTSAX vs SWPPX. I only see VTSAX on this sub but is there any real difference?,dequeued,11/27/2021,2.0,Youre welcome.  Assuming youre at Schwab you might consider a US total stock market fund for future purchases (especially in a taxable account). That would be SWTSX if you want to use a mutual fund or a more tax-efficient ETF like VTI or SCHB. Either of the latter two funds are probably your best option for a taxable account.  Another option would be purchasing an extended market ETF like VXF to round out your US stocks if you want to [approximate the US total stock market](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_stock_market) overall.  Or just keep doing what youre doing.  The only other thing Ill add is that if the market drops significantly it can sometimes be an opportunity to switch funds without incurring capital gains. (For any funds in an IRA or other tax-advantaged account you could switch to different funds at any time without worrying about capital gains.)

r3pm4w,hmd8su6,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,jhairehmyah,11/27/2021,6.0,There are a number of issues in medicine that aren’t life or death and can be a choice.  Just last month my Doctor recommended an MRI for my bulged disc. I refused. Because I’ve been working out and my new strength has made the pain less and what will an MRI tell me—that I’m SOL and have to live with it?  That said isn’t the purpose of insurance to help you cover costs AFTER something has gone wrong? AFTER your home gets hit by a tornado AFTER you hit the other car AFTER you lift the thing the wrong way and go on temporary disability? And all those cases have a deductible.   If your checkup (free) finds a skin cancer a heart murmur high blood pressure etc it’s done it’s job. It’s helped you identify an issue before it gets worse and more costly (and in heath fatal).  I hate the system as much as the next guy but let’s stop pretending that insurance doesn’t work this way: with deductibles.

r3pm4w,hmcur9c,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,cloverdoodles,11/27/2021,18.0,Except doctors don’t know the details of your health insurance coverage. Doctors participate in insurance networks. Many networks have many different plans that result in different patient financial responsibility depending on the plan. Doctors do not know this off the top of their heads. Frankly they don’t know it even if you tell them I have X HD Plan. If you need to know costs before a procedure you have to have the office send the claim in for preapproval from your insurance company (or learn how your plan works). Sometimes it is opaque as it’s unclear how a procedure is taxonomized by the insurance company and calling the insurance company (who would think to do that?!) first will tell you what to expect.  Mechanics on the other hand are often the direct business owner who sets prices. There is no third party involved in determining what you owe. What the mechanic says is what you owe. What the doctor charges is not necessarily what you owe. What you have to write a check for is based on your *insurance company*. Also this is why I do copay plans only. Much easier to plan out of pocket expenses.

r3pm4w,r3pm4w,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Key-Emu5781,11/27/2021,515.0,Went to my annual checkup where they did an EKG which came back abnormal. Doctor said we need to do an echo now didn’t really ask or anything. Got the echo done and now I just got a bill for $700. Insurance isn’t covering any of it since it’s a “diagnostic procedure”.   Any way I can get my GP to lower this/talk it down?
r3pm4w,hmcmhr1,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Mtntop24680,11/27/2021,3.0,TBH I once had to pay $600 for an echo AFTER insurance- at the hospital where I worked nonetheless. It can be a pricey procedure.   I’m guessing the doc is affiliated with a larger health system. Virtually all of them have some kind of financial aid system and will even offer “discounts” for paying it all at once or setting up a payment plan. It’s worth asking to speak to the hospital’s financial counselor. They may even be able to help wring some cash out of your insurance company. As others have said they may be able to change the coding slightly to convince them to pay it or to justify the use of a diagnostic echo.

r3pm4w,hmcn7gy,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,GenericMelon,11/27/2021,12.0,I would definitely give your insurance a call to double-check that everythings in order. My grandma was charged for something that shouldve been covered by her insurance I called insurance and they said Oh were just missing the address of the medical facility. It could be as simple as that.  If that route doesnt work you can always call the office that did the EKG and come up with an interest-free payment plan. You may even been able to talk the balance down if you ask.

r3pm4w,hmd14rm,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,DoomBuggE,11/27/2021,18.0,RN here. This is simply the peril of having a high deductible plan. This is not a coding mistake or a billing mistake. You were charged for a diagnostic exam because by definition that’s what an echocardiogram is. It’s not possible to code this as preventative without committing billing fraud. The echo was ordered in response to an abnormal finding and that’s where you go from “routine preventative visit” to “problem visit” therefore your deductible applies. Talking to the doctor’s office won’t change that.  Very few services are considered preventative care. If you have any work up of anything abnormal at all - abnormal EKG cough/cold symptoms abnormal paps etc. Your $1800 deductible applies for all of these things.  Also why is your GP doing EKGs? This is not routine unless you have cardiac symptoms like fainting dizziness etc. I would actually be surprised that an EKG would be covered as preventative even if results were totally normal.  It’s open enrollment for many. Change your insurance to a deductible you can handle if you can.

After 10k in the account you can actually pick your investment vehicle for the money.  The catch is that you can reimburse yourself for medical expenses that you paid out of pocket for you cant just take the money out for no reason later in life and buy a house.  You need to keep every receipt and invoice from every medical expense you pay out of pocket.  I recommend scanning them and keeping them digitally in a folder as well as on the cloud so you dont lose them.  Were talking 40 years of bills when its all said and done.  Then you can reimburse yourself for all of that out of your account tax-free after it has gained 30-40 years of interest on the principal.

Preventive care is very limited to a small set of codes that primarily focus around your regular checkups and standard labs. If that lab comes back weird and you do anything else that is no longer preventive that is reactive. The bad thing already happened.

The two are not mutually exclusive.   Every month you are in debt to your electricity provider. You are in debt to your other utilities. You owe this money unless you prepay all your bills so they all show a positive balance and technically owe you money.   It is the same concept with a properly utilized credit card. My cell provider gives me a months worth of service I pay them with a credit card which I then pay off when due. The same with my other monthly bills. The same with gas for my car. Im not in any more debt than I am with my regular bills Im just delaying the timing of the money coming out of my account.

I am thinking of getting rid of all my credit cards and only using the T-Mobile account as the main account to pay bills and buy coffee.  T-Mobile pays you 4% on the money you have in it up to 3k. After that 1%. I would use this account for automatic payments for bills and buying coffee. My checking account I use to be able to quickly transfer money to my Roth and brokerage account.  The only debt I have is for school that Im going to currently for my nurse practitioner license. My house is paid off and I have someone living with me who pays rent. Is there any reason to keep credit cards open when I could just use the T-Mobile account? Thanks in advance.  Edit: A little background on me.

Here it is:   You get a credit card bill you pay it IN FULL before the due date.  This earns you cashback or other rewards banks don’t offer. For example my PayPal MasterCard Credit card is 2% cash back on every purchase anywhere. That’s actually quite significant in the long run.
r3p31h,hmc7tvk,"Should I get rid of all my credit cards and just use a 2nd debit card as my ""credit card""?",phord,11/27/2021,4.0,When your debit card number gets stolen and someone runs up $10000 in fraudulent charges youll need to contact your bank and dispute all the fraud charges. The bank will reverse the charges through the system. They have 60 days to return your money to your account. They have no incentive to go faster and you will be out that money until they refund it. Youll need to keep track of all the fraudulent charges and reconcile them as they get refunded individually over the several weeks it takes for that to happen. If any charges dont get refunded youll need to raise that again with the bank and investigate what happened.  If your credit card number is stolen and used fraudulently you will need to notify the credit card company and then dont pay that part of the bill. The cc company will take care of the rest and notify you if any disputes are challenged. Meanwhile you get to keep your bank balance. If you have two credit cards you can begin using the other one while you wait for your primary one to be replaced.  Debit cards are a trick from the devil.

Utilization is not a building factor since it has no memory: it only cares about the last reported number from each account so you can usually manipulate that factor as desired in 5 weeks or less.  Just stay within budget and pay full statement balances before the cutoff time of the due date.
r3paha,hmckv5h,building credit,joemetarei,11/27/2021,1.0,Just use it for normal things like groceries gas etc and pay off in full.

r3paha,hmc15pp,building credit,blipsman,11/27/2021,3.0,Use what you need and can pay off in full each month. Don’t worry about utilization as it’s determined each month.

If you pay in full every month by the due date there is no balance to which an APR can be applied.  I have more than 25 credit cards and couldnt tell you the APR on any of them.  What I *can* tell you is which one I use for which type of purchase to maximize the rewards *they pay me*.  I never really was a balance carrier but I have left a ton of money on the table in my lifetime by either using debit card (BARF) or putting purchases on shitty rewards cards.

r3paha,r3paha,building credit,pr1ncesspeaxh,11/27/2021,5.0,hi! i need some advice on the best way to build perfect credit. i’m 18 just got approved for a credit card but when i checked my email i saw the APR was 26.99% and my credit limit is $750. i have no intentions of not paying my bill on time but i know that’s pretty high.  so if my limit is $750 how much should i be spending of that monthly? $100? $80? how many purchases should i break that down into?  i just wanna make sure i don’t do anything wrong because i’ve witnessed my dad and step mom struggle through improving bad credit and i’d rather just get it as perfect as i can from the start.
r3otqf,hmbuqqi,"I recently came into 20,000$ and I have no idea what to do with it.",simpkill,11/27/2021,3.0,This is not financial advice.  I would probably put most of that into a savings account.  Probably 5 months worth of living expenses to cover your ass for bad times should they unfortunately arise.  If 20k doesnt cover that then work up to it.

r3paha,hmc2ao0,building credit,obsessedsoul,11/27/2021,3.0,Well if youre trying to build credit and have no intentions on paying on time you already failed. You cant try to build up your credit and not pay your bills on time. If you want to build your credit up youll need to pay your credit cards on time in full. I would suggest you make smart purchases. You never want to go over 10% of your credit limit. It will lower your credit score if you do.   Make some small purchases like groceries gas phone etc but dont go over 10% to 15% of your credit limit ($75) and split the payment (when you do that itll increase your credit) pay 15 days before your statement date and 3 day before. Another way of increasing your credit score is being on a trusted friend or family members credit card as am authorized user. I put my brother and cousin on my credit card and their credit score went up 100+ but again someone you trust and is responsible. Thats all the advice I can give ...good luck with everything
r3paha,hmc3ila,building credit,optimaloptimist101,11/27/2021,4.0,Perfect. Use responsibly and treat the credit card like the money is coming out your bank account right away on every purchase. Feel free to reach out with any questions.

We wanted to do the homestead thing but also worked so we bought a home on 2.5 acres less than an hour from 3 metro areas (one major city two regional cities). We got stupid lucky - were now selling and just accepted an offer for almost 200k (44%) more than we paid. With covid people are wanting more space and working from home more so commute is less of a concern so youre likely to have a bigger value raise in a more rural area near a big metro area. That said you cant predict the future and prices are currently through the roof so buy what you can afford and want to live in.

What are some good resources we can use to educate ourselves on modern real estate markets and land speculation?   Would a fiduciary be a good resource to get started?  I get a few sessions with a company fiduciary at work as a benefit and Im considering scheduling an appointment but Id really like to arrive with some preliminary research done so I know what to ask and to make the most of the time.  Essentially this boils down to we dont know what we dont know.  We live in Austin so property values can get pretty high in the city. but there are lots of options in surrounding suburbs.

But money matters aside which location fits your lifestyle best? I personally live in a suburb of a major city and value having a grocery store restaurants the library a gym etc. within a 10 minute drive of my house. In fact my next house will likely be in a city so that I can *walk* to all of those places instead of driving. Consider your goals and lifestyle and work from there. Don’t let your MIL dictate the biggest purchase of your life.   Also a fiduciary is generally not an expert on land speculation or real estate. I would talk to a real estate agent if you want to understand how different homes in Austin and surrounding areas have historically appreciated.

r3onq2,hmc19db,"First time home buyer, should we focus on a homestead type & rural property or something in the suburbs? How can we educate ourselves better on this subject to make a wiser investment?",quelindolio,11/27/2021,14.0,Hello fellow Austinite! My whole family for multiple generations all come from a very rural part of a county next to Travis. I strong discourage you from buying actual rural land in your situation.  The first reason is utilities. If you live in Austin proper you have city water Austin energy electric curbside single stream recycling high speed internet and more. When you move out to places like Burnet eastern Wilco Bastrop etc. all of that goes away. My family had septic well water no internet. We had to haul trash to the dump every two weeks in an old truck. The rest of it we burned. Even in a nicer area your are looking at dealing with a septic tank and slow internet at a minimum.   The second reason is that land is a lot of work. Most people who have rural properties get an ag exemption on their taxes. But that involves farming ranching or otherwise putting the land to productive use. This is a lot of work when you know what you are doing. It’s a nightmare if you have to learn. There are smaller hobbies products like chickens and bees that will count. Those are less work than cattle but still work. You have to mow or shred two acres regularly to deal with overgrowth. Even if you like the wild look it becomes a huge fire hazard in drought conditions.  Also wildlife. If you have pets and kids you need to get good at identifying snakes. You need to learn to protect your pets and livestock from coyotes foxes raccoons and the like. Where we lived packs of wild dogs were a big issue. People like to abandon their unwanted pets on rural properties. You often end up rescuing puppies and kittens from drainage areas on your property.   Another is lack of services. It took EMS over 30 minutes to arrive for my grandmothers heart attack. There is no food delivery. You have to go into town for everything. Your local grocery store won’t have a lot of the specialty items you have have gotten used to at an Austin H‑E‑B.   In sum don’t buy a rural property unless you know what that life is like and want to live it. If you can afford it buy a house on a larger lot just outside the city. The land towards the toll road has historically been cheaper but will likely increase in value with the gigafactory going up.

r3opj2,hmbwahh,Advice on money,rxneutrino,11/27/2021,2.0,We need more info here but if under $1k is *all you have* investing is not recommended until you have an emergency fund. If you carry any high interest debt like on a credit card investing is not recommended until you pay it off.  Once you have an emergency of 6 months of living expenses in a liquid account (like a bank acct) you can consider funding a 401k or Roth IRA but those will depend on your employment status. The advice there will be to utilize index funds over the long term for growth over decades.  If youre looking to use investing to get rich in the short term then youre essentially gambling and you should know that the chance of reward is proportional to risk.

r3paha,hmd07mg,building credit,lightnglass,11/27/2021,2.0,I understand fully - I also grew up poor but my Dad got me a credit card young and the first thing he told me was to treat it like a debit card to never charge anything more than I could actually afford - he wanted to make sure I did not get into debt.  This advice stuck with me in the back of my head while I watched friends buy lavish things on credit cards and get into horrible debt that they could not dig out of (and still cant).  Dont do that and you will be fine.  People get into trouble because they have shiny new toy syndrome and start buying up all these nice things they cant yet afford because they only have to pay the minimum balance (and dont understand how they are racking up 26% interest fees on that balance).  I grew up poor so I knew how to survive with bare necessities as will you.  This will serve you in the long run and you are already thinking about how to treat a credit card responsibly which I can assure you the majority of people do not ever even think about.  Youre already ahead of the game you just dont know it yet.

Once you move out your expenses may go up quite a bit.  Lump sum invest 6k into an IRA. Consider 100% in a S&P 500 fund.  If you are eligible max out and invest in an HSA.  If you can max out your 401k.  However you may want to consider not doing that and investing a fair amount into a taxable account.   Consider not buying a house just because your friends are graduating.  Only buy when you are ready to buy whether the market is up or down.  Pay attention to your fund expenses (ERs administrative etc) especially through your 401k.  Typically they pass most of the fees on to their employees.  Whats most important is that you figure out your overall investment and ***tax*** strategy.  As in if you plan on retiring early you may want to ladder monies from an IRA to a Roth as needed so you get the most tax-efficient outcome.  Also of note just because a vehicle is tax-sheltered doesnt always make it the best option.  Your 401k and IRA monies are locked up until your late 50s.  Only with few exceptions would you be able to withdraw early without penalties.  A taxable account is a great tool to use since it seems like you can easily be well on your way to FIRE.  Use your taxable and tax-sheltered tools to your advantage.
r3pawf,hmbzql2,VTSAX vs SWPPX. I only see VTSAX on this sub but is there any real difference?,dequeued,11/27/2021,1.0,SWPPX is a good fund with a super low expense ratio.  I think the only significant difference is that most Vanguard **mutual funds** are more tax-efficient because of their unique fund structure (this only applies to Vanguard mutual funds that have also have an ETF share class). This only matters for taxable accounts though. (Of course if you already hold SWPPX in a taxable account and it has already increased in value I wouldnt recommend switching those shares to anything else because capital gains are generally something you want to defer as long as possible and that matters more than a minor difference in tax efficiency.)  Beyond that:  - I have a slight preference for US total stock market funds over S&P 500 funds because they also include small cap stocks but the historical rate of return is basically the same.  - I also have a slight preference for Vanguard index funds because they tend to be *ever-so-slightly* better funds on average compared to similar funds from Schwab Fidelity iShares etc. on measures such as number of holdings tracking error cash percentages (lower is better in stock market funds) etc. Nowadays the difference is so small that it barely matters though.  - Edit: Youre asking about a Schwab fund but just to cover the bases: The Fidelity ZERO funds have an additional strike against them for taxable accounts because they cannot be transferred outside of Fidelity (unlike most other mutual funds and unlike all ETFs).

The Feds own and will always own them.  The Feds are firing some of these awful servicers and replacing them with hopefully less awful servicers.

r3oi6z,hmbswwv,Student Loans Transfering to New Lender,93195,11/27/2021,7.0, No impact to your credit not sold either (and it wouldn’t matter if they were) just changing servicers.  This isn’t about credit score anyway it’s about cost.  If the interest rate is fairly high (>5%) pay them off and save yourself some money.  If the non-deferred interest rate is pretty low (<3%) put your money to work elsewhere and pay minimums.  If the interest is in between you do you.

r3paha,hmcxzyr,building credit,lightnglass,11/27/2021,3.0,Im assuming you are fairly young are you around 18?  The reason I ask is if you are that young you really should not worry about having a perfect credit score now.  That is going to take a few years to build up.  What you want to worry about now is treating it responsibly (which you seem to be).    I got my first credit card when I was 16 (through my Dad) and have used them responsibly ever since I am now 36.  Use the card for small expenses pay off the card in full every single month - after a year or so get a new credit card (keep the old one) and charge different things to each card pay off both cards in full every month - rinse and repeat this over the years.  I currently have 6 credit cards - I use two for all my expenses (minus mortgage) and the other 4 I either charge 1 thing per month to or they are affiliated with a store I shop at semi-regularly and only use the card at that store for the points.  I pay all of them off every month in full.  I have a credit score above 800.  I pay off my car loans every month (and always have) I paid off my student loans already but back when I had those payments I paid more than the balance due every month.  To build a high credit score and keep it just means not having debt / paying off your debts in full each month.  Treat your credit card as a debit card and you will be fine.  If you use your credit cards in this manner the credit card company will be paying YOU money vs you paying them money (interest).  I have not paid for a airplane ticket in years due to my points on my travel credit card I am constantly getting free money to spend on Amazon from my Amazon card points.  You get the point.

r3pawf,hmc4tga,VTSAX vs SWPPX. I only see VTSAX on this sub but is there any real difference?,nutoreddit,11/27/2021,1.0,Thanks for the detailed answer. I have funds in taxable accounts in SWPPX. I guess I was wondering if I just continue to load that in the coming years or move to VTSAX. Seems there is no real reason and I still have options within Schwab funds.
r3pawf,hmbzfje,VTSAX vs SWPPX. I only see VTSAX on this sub but is there any real difference?,t-poke,11/27/2021,21.0,SWPPX is Schwab’s S&P index fund. VTSAX is entire US market.  If you’re at Schwab and want the entire market SWTSX is their VTSAX equivalent.  However SWPPX is fine and if you’re in a taxable account I would not create a taxable event by switching.
r3pawf,hmc5qfo,VTSAX vs SWPPX. I only see VTSAX on this sub but is there any real difference?,vynm2,11/27/2021,3.0,Oops! Youre right. I read it as **It** would...  not **I** would...  Thanks for pointing out my mistake!
r3pawf,hmc8ly1,VTSAX vs SWPPX. I only see VTSAX on this sub but is there any real difference?,nutoreddit,11/27/2021,2.0,Yep. No fees 😊
r3onq2,hmbukpg,"First time home buyer, should we focus on a homestead type & rural property or something in the suburbs? How can we educate ourselves better on this subject to make a wiser investment?",hmspain,11/27/2021,9.0,Just my two cents but dont invest in a home.  A home is where you live.  Dont buy more than you can afford and buy something that is comfortable for you.  Investments are something entirely different IMHO.
r3pawf,hmbzman,VTSAX vs SWPPX. I only see VTSAX on this sub but is there any real difference?,Werewolfdad,11/27/2021,6.0,Swppx is a sp500 index fund which is more comparable to VFIAX.    You’d want swtsx at schwab which is a total market fund.
r3pawf,hmc6wlp,VTSAX vs SWPPX. I only see VTSAX on this sub but is there any real difference?,dequeued,11/27/2021,2.0,Ive never seen it mentioned in a post but its definitely possible because Ive seen much worse things than that. The wiki tries to steer people towards in-house mutual funds but it could perhaps emphasize that more.
r3pm4w,hmehtob,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,cmilla646,11/28/2021,3.0,So we have the money to find out “something” is wrong with you you are just going to have to pay out of for us to narrow it down for you. I mean maybe it makes sense somehow but it sure feels wrong.
r3pm4w,hmf0zar,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,kcdc25,11/28/2021,1.0,I’m confused. Did the doctor strap you down to do the echo? This is an absolutely appropriate follow up test to an abnormal EKG. Billing is going to depend on where you did the echo.
r3pm4w,hmf3f67,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,DoomBuggE,11/28/2021,2.0,Honestly it’s a little weird that they have an echo-trained person and an echo machine in a GP office. Usually those folks work specifically in Cardiology or Radiology departments. Anyone can be trained to do a simple EKG I did them as an Emergency Department volunteer while in nursing school many times. But performing an echocardiogram is a much more nuanced skill. I am somewhat trained in pelvic sonography (on the job training - this isn’t covered in nursing school) and honestly when my daughter needed multiple cardiac echoes after her hospitalization I could barely tell what I was looking at.  This GP must order a lot of echoes… unless the GP does big business doing in house pre-op clearances this seems like a GP that orders everything under the sun to maximize billing. Yes maybe there were legitimate findings on the EKG which then sends you down a diagnostic rabbit hole but as I mentioned earlier most GPs do not order routine EKGs for an annual. I think they probably find a lot of abnormal findings that don’t need treatment just like yours. Find a new GP!
r3pm4w,hmezhqg,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,AlphaTangoFoxtrt,11/28/2021,1.0,My experience is anything you bring up and talk about/look at is fine. But if they have to do any further procedures (blood work ekg biopsy etc.) Thats not.  Example I had a severly itchy spot on my scalp. I told the doctor. He looked at it and asked me to put my hat back on.  The hat band was right over the spot and he said it was most likely just irritation caused by a clogged pore from the hat and sweat. and to loosen my hats band if not stop wearing hats for a week. Sure enough that fixed it no extra bill.  But if they had to biopsy it it would have cost me for that procedure.
r3pm4w,hmdd7ty,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,nobodyaskedyouxx,11/28/2021,3.0,Can I ask how is this something I can find out? Shopping around for MRI prices doesnt seem like simple info to find where would I start?
r3pm4w,hmdzm3i,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,JackHGUK,11/28/2021,4.0,😂😂😂😂😂 38k for 3 days in hospital.
r3pm4w,hmf4ckx,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,ChaoticSquirrel,11/28/2021,1.0,People talk down bills yes but generally as self-pay patients for non-covered services or with hospitals for major medical procedures. Im not saying not to call your doctor but be aware that many insurers mandate that doctors offices cant waive patient responsibility for procedures that were approved and go towards the deductible or out-of-pocket max.
r3pm4w,hmddzgg,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,cloverdoodles,11/28/2021,0.0,I mean OP can also just buzz his insurance company and get an answer on coverage. I’ve done that multiple times in the past. It’s like a 20 minute phone call.
r3pm4w,hmew7xs,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,MajesticLilFruitcake,11/28/2021,3.0,It’s not regulated in a way that benefits the consumer. A regulation is enacted but there’s always a loophole that insurance companies use to continue to excessively profit off of the consumer. It doesn’t matter how many regulations there are if they are all so poorly done.
r3pm4w,hmejd0h,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,mcarneybsa,11/28/2021,0.0,The annual visit/preventive care part of it is still covered at no cost. The office visit for a specific issue you are now engaging in is different. The doctors office is being very forward thinking in letting you know that specific issues could constitute a different type of encounter.
r3pm4w,hmfdudq,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Coug_Love,11/28/2021,1.0,I have seen from previous posts that not all doctors know this info. I do not doubt what you are saying at all and wouldnt even expect my doctor to know in every case. When she comes across something unusual she does check with the admin team or tells me to do so. I guess it really depends on the how many insurance companies the office accepts how often the doctor orders unusual tests and the culture of that specific office.
r3pm4w,hmdr0i2,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Laney20,11/28/2021,12.0,Same but one of our options is the lowest high deductible that counts. Its only like $2k. I put enough in my hsa to cover that throughout the year so it ends up not being straight out of pocket but its still kinda rough.
r3pm4w,hmeyrdp,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,AlphaTangoFoxtrt,11/28/2021,1.0,The dictionary definition and the legal definition as in what your insurance contract defines it as may often be different.  Remember that common sense doesnt apply in legal matters. The letter of the law/contract does.
r3pm4w,hmf2uoo,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Key-Emu5781,11/28/2021,1.0,I’m not saying that this shouldn’t have happened but they gave zero warning didn’t ask about or have a discussion and as I’m reading below it is not normal Procedure to just do it immediately in same building. If I had been able to schedule a separate appointment I could have found somewhere cheaper to do it / not do it at all.
r3pm4w,hmelb83,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,bros402,11/28/2021,0.0,so if your doctor told you lets scan your entire body to see if anything is going on during a physical youd expect that to be covered to?  the echo is diagnostic not wellness   this is what is generally considered parts of a physical - https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/annual-physical-examinations
r3pm4w,hmf3nzz,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Key-Emu5781,11/28/2021,1.0,Oof yeah I agree — first and last appointment with this GP!
r3pm4w,hme7byw,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Csherman92,11/28/2021,2.0,That’s not true. Most things denied by insurance are not because the insurance refuses to pay it’s because it is coded wrong.   Things get coded wrong all the time and get resubmitted the right way to be covered. Most insurance companies will fix the error.
r3pm4w,hmfg41g,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,ThinkerIMB,11/28/2021,1.0,You might call around to get costs at other providers and bring figures in about lower cost options to your provider and ask for a reduction. I had an Rx for a knee x-ray and checked around before getting it done. The place I chose was only 10% of what they would’ve charged at the hospital that the doctor’s office referred me to. Similarly compared costs before having bone scans. However your procedure is already done so you can only ask for a reduction but showing costs charged by other providers may help your likelihood of success.  Also doctors are very eager to avoid negative yelp! reviews.  Remember to be courteous because they don’t have to give you a reduction so maintaining a respectful demeanor should help your likelihood of success.
r3pm4w,hmdmayl,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,MrCrow9000,11/28/2021,-3.0,No sounds like they didnt... Also listing to the professional is not a sound strategy.   There are many people out there willing to scam you or your insurance out of more money just because they can.  Get some extra opinions from other doctors if you want.
r3pm4w,hmfi47t,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,bearseatbeets1414,11/28/2021,1.0,Maybe call the company who did the echo and see if they can bill you directly instead if first billing insurance. Usually there is a pretty big discount if you dont go through insurance which might be good especially if your deductible will reset anyways at the beginning of the year. After seeing if there is a discount for paying without insurance ask if there is a discount for paying it all off at once rather than spread out through payments. You can often get a 10 to 20% discount doing this.
r3pm4w,hme904k,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Unlike_Agholor,11/28/2021,12.0,You are wrong. an HSA is a savings account that is YOUR money. it does not go away and is yours forever even if you switch employers.
r3pm4w,hmeak8j,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,ticktock76,11/28/2021,15.0,You are thinking of an FSA. Flex Spending Accounts are very limited in what you can roll over and even what you roll over you usually have to use for expenses incurred in the year you contributed.   A Health Savings Account is different. HSA’s are used similar to FSAs but are only available to folks with high deductible health insurance and allow the money to grow year over year as an investment.
r3pm4w,hmed2c1,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,silvenga,11/28/2021,1.0,When your employer is willing to pay 800 a month for your insurance you take it.
r3pm4w,hmeq8p0,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,mynewaccount5,11/28/2021,2.0,Yeah I got charged $200 because my doctor asked a few questions about my abnormal weight gain which was resolved 5 seconds later when I said I wasnt excercising as much when the pandemic started.   The American medical industrybis disgusting.
r3pm4w,hmejebl,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,cnoobs,11/28/2021,1.0,Yeah I like my PPO. The non-ppo option is a $2000 deductible and 57$/pp. PPO is high deductible $2500 but contributing $20/pp + company matching to a FSA my deductible practically pays for itself with the flex savings account and my payment is $61/pp. I’ve spent $0 on health insurance this year outside of pay periods
r3pm4w,hmek6me,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,eziern,11/28/2021,2.0,Call the hospital and tell them you can’t pay that amount. Offer to pay like $200 cash now to pay it off. See if they will accept it. Mention you want to pay it but you just don’t have the means now. They may try and negotiate give them a little wiggle room.   See if that works? They can technically do that but depends on their organizational needs/structure for said tasks. The messed up part is the $700 is probably still with the negotiated insurance rate versus non-insured rate.
r3pm4w,hme6g1v,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,wyezwunn,11/28/2021,2.0,Heres what Ive tried.   1. Got charged for a procedure that was advertised as free. Their guy call me and said he was a lawyer and I should pay because the other part of that days procedure was the free part. I said I disagree so Im not paying and tell the doctor hes already spent more paying you to call me than hell ever get from me so he should cut his losses and leave me alone. Lawyer laughed and hung up. They left me alone. 2. Got charged for another preventive procedure and they said I said something about a problem after I came in so the procedure was diagnostic and not free. Gave them the same *cut your losses* spiel along with telling them I had excellent credit that would still be excellent if they put it on my credit report so dont expect me to pay for that bait-and-switch. They put it on my credit report. My credit stayed excellent especially after I put a note in my credit report with my explanation. My employer routinely checks employees credit and didnt see it as a problem.  3. Got charged for an annual check-up because they said they found something. I told them their diagnostic procedure was wrong according to a credible health entitys guidelines so they couldnt prove they found something. They paid me back what theyd overcharged. Took ten years and an audit but they paid me back.  About $100 each time. I could afford it but it was the principle. Not sure if any of this would work for OPs $700.
r3sotg,hmevs9x,How to Find a Great CPA,iamfromwoywoy,11/28/2021,2.0,Been looking for years..... if you find one let me know
r3pm4w,hmdjp2d,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,SnooGuavas1745,11/28/2021,3.0,The whole system is shite. They shouldn’t have to ask anyone what insurance covers and we shouldn’t be expected to jump through such RIDICULOUS hoops to get proper care. Besides the insurance can change its mind later and pay a smaller portion “because it’s not medically necessary.”  There is a statement on most (if not all) insurance phone calls stating that everything is just a quote when providers verify your benefits. And that the insurance will determine the final cost after the claim is fully processed. So you may pay your patient responsibility at the time of service BUT you can also be hit with an additional bill later.   Sometimes I swear it just depends on which claims processor gets your claim.
r3pm4w,hmdv576,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Invest2prosper,11/28/2021,-1.0,GP is doing EKG to boost their annual gross income per patient.  Sorry if it sounds like bordering on unethical behavior.  I’ve had it done twice and each time referred to a specialist who said I kid you not - “what are you doing here” ran all the tests and said there is absolutely nothing wrong with your heart.  Eat healthy exercise and reduce stress.  Enjoy the rest of your life.  Says a lot of these GPs are basically running EKGs to CYA (other symptoms can screen for fainting - bad reaction to medication anxiety low blood sugar etc.) or boost annual billing at $250 a pop whereas an annual physical runs $165.  Do the math.
r3pm4w,hme7mic,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Advanced-Blackberry,11/28/2021,1.0,You sound like a shite patient for criticizing docs for not being insurance experts.  I want my physician to know what’s best for me. Apparently your criteria is insurance knowledge. They could be fantastic at everything else but you’d think they suck because they don’t understand whatever shitty plan you walked in with. Nice criteria there.    Plans are complicated and insurance is very bad about giving good information on coverage. My dermatologist office doesn’t let me pay on day of service because it all needs run thru insurance first because they don’t trust the information given to them. I work in healthcare the info given is not always accurate.
r3pm4w,hmdpbz5,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,biggerfriestofish,11/28/2021,7.0,Doctors generally do not know how each patient’s insurance company will classify specific codes either.   It’s ultimately on the patient to know their health insurance coverage in advance.  But the US health insurance and medical billing system are designed to be virtually impossible to navigate especially for lay people.

r3pm4w,hmfjkil,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,mastershakeit89,11/28/2021,1.0,Explaining that you are okay will be 300 more dollars. Now if you will just sign the discharge papers and pay the 35 dollar pen fee.

If doc told you upfront it would be $700 to make sure you don’t have a heart condition you’d have been like “no. If I die I die. I can’t pay $700 to make sure I’m good”? While I understand that you are upset at the cost you can ALWAYS ask if they can give you a discount or allow you to make affordable payments.
r3pm4w,hmdhb88,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,thunfremlinc,11/28/2021,2.0,Not at all it’s “I’m pissed that my doctor did a procedure without letting me know that this is no longer preventative and is now diagnostic”.   Even if OP fully understood their insurance they’d still be bitten by this practice. We’re not doctors. We don’t know which procedure falls into what category.
r3pm4w,hmeu6l1,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,VioletChipmunk,11/28/2021,1.0,Thats ok but fyi that is not the most optimal use of HSA. If you are saving for retirement do some reading on it.
r3pm4w,hmdxxun,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,saltycod,11/28/2021,3.0,>I am a big believer in low or no deductible plans for this reason even if you’re relatively healthy.  Youre simply loaning your insurance company money at 0% interest to pay for future medical expenses. Whereas with an HDHP you have to pay up front sure but you get to keep the unspent healthcare costs and invest them into your own HSA with pre-tax dollars and let the wealth build for yourself instead of some corporation.

Healthcare only gets more expensive as you age - new teeth optical medical premiums. Yeah getting old can be expensive most young people don’t think of this when they are young.
r3pm4w,hme7a6j,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Advanced-Blackberry,11/28/2021,1.0,I didn’t mean yell at someone. I was referring to taking it up with insurance so his complaint is directed at the company that doesn’t pay. But now seeing that it’s a deductible issue anywys the insurance company is in the right as well and this is entirely on the OP. No blame should be passed around.
r3pm4w,hmdfx8g,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,jds2001,11/28/2021,1.0,Most of the time an echo wouldnt code as an office visit - just the procedure (facility + professional fees if applicable)
r3pm4w,hmfam1n,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,swtimmer,11/28/2021,1.0,Worse part is that the insurance never paid 30k. They negotiate hard and might have paid a similar amount as you.
r3pm4w,hmeqk2h,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Chinacat_Sunflower72,11/28/2021,2.0,Correct. We have FSA at work and I didn’t use it all and it did not roll over.

r3pm4w,hmf3i0e,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,IronBatman,11/28/2021,1.0,Doctor here. This is how the Sheridan health system works. It is fragmented and expensive but thats what we have unfortunately. And from the doctors view we dont know what insurance you have (unless we specifically check) we dont know what each insurance covers. All we do is medicine. I dont know what your EKG looked like but an abnormal one could be life threatening and you would be wise to work it up.

r3pm4w,hmdn385,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,DecentFart,11/28/2021,5.0,It is intentionally a pain in the butt. You have to call around and see if places can give you quotes. Maybe there is something available now but the last time I was shopping around for a procedure there was no easy website to find prices. I had to call around and not everywhere would give me a price. Atleast get a quote from two different places. Once you see how much the price can vary you will be very thankful you spent the time obtaining them.  Try talking to your health insurance company first. See if they have a tool for finding operation costs. Then still call around to see if your health insurance would actually be worse because the insurance companies guarantee a certain price for the procedure but some out of network place can do it for less than your deductible if you are paying cash.

r3pm4w,hmdxcdi,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,saltycod,11/28/2021,8.0,HDHP almost always ends up cheaper. For a PPO to be better than an HDHP you have to be in the sweet spot of healthcare between virtually no care needed and a lot of care needed. Very people exist in this region.

r3pm4w,hmeqqwd,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,mynewaccount5,11/28/2021,0.0,Pushing off a physical is terrible advice. Especially considering insurance needs months to even grant these kinds of claims so you could get the PPO a week later and get denied a month later effectively throwing thousands(?) Of dollars away.   Just get your physical whenever. If its urgent then its a good thing you caught it early. If its not so urgent you have plenty of time for insurance to process and can still wait to do it after you increase your insurance benefits at open enrollment.
r3qb30,hmf7wet,401K catch-up for 2021?,j-christopher,11/28/2021,1.0,My employers plan only allows me to specify up to 15% (in whole % increments) for regular 401(k) contributions and up to 15% (in whole % increments) for catch-up and these are set independently of one another.  Changes to these designations are self-service and the limits/constraints are listed on the plans web site right next to where I specify my elections.  My preference would be to take $0 net paychecks at the beginning of each year until Ive maxed the entire years contributions and then move on but the plan doesnt support that option.

The medical staff have no idea about the billing. This allows them to recommend treatment based on the safest measures not the cheapest. Certainly it is considered at times (lets switch to x blood thinner because y blood thinner is known to be crazy expensive) when the efficacy is similar enough.   I wish they had someone who would tell you because unfortunately the reality is that cost is a big factor for most of us. But lets not say that the doctors are the issue here.

r3pm4w,hmdti40,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Matt_Tress,11/28/2021,8.0,Same here. Just for me regular ppo is $120/pp. But the hdhp? Only $9/pp! That’s $111/pp or $2886/year heading to my HSA instead of an insurance company’s premiums. My company contributes $500 towards my HSA as well.   The deductible is $3k with the same out of pocket max so you’d be an idiot to do the ppo.
r3qahc,hmejw3i,Wife earned some money on the side. Not sure what to do.,mikasjoman,11/28/2021,1.0,This is kind of typical. Someone starts a business just to try to sell some stuff. But as it takes off they forget to open a company and more important that the law is quite strict on the you have to do the weekly accounting or pay fines/go to jail part.   Get pro help with an accountant. Its gonna save you a lot of headache and it sounds like shes gonna need one going ahead anyways given that shell continue her business..
r3pm4w,hmesmqv,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,Coug_Love,11/28/2021,1.0,You are right about not accepting a ton of different insurance companies. I have noticed over the years more and more doctors offices in my area having notices regarding what insurance they do/dont accept. I am even seeing a few specialist that dont accept insurance. I thought that was the trend everywhere but perhaps not.
r3qahc,hmed0sg,Wife earned some money on the side. Not sure what to do.,Celodurismo,11/28/2021,1.0,Others haven’t mentioned this but you can just call it hobby income and be done with it. You’ll pay more in taxes since you can’t deduct anything seeing as you’re talking about 30k it’s probably fair to assume the cost of not deducting business expenses will exceed the cost of an accountant.
r3qahc,hmdcocf,Wife earned some money on the side. Not sure what to do.,PetraLoseIt,11/28/2021,1.0,> I am worried that the sticker shock she gets will discourage her.  I was thinking about this too. In the end you almost always will have made extra money on her doing this (the exception would be if through her income youd fall out of a certain beneficial program that gave you more than what she earned-after-taxes).   But it might be good to look at the total effect of her doing this on your lives.  Youd first have to calculate how much she really earned: revenu minus costs minus income tax. Then look at the work she has to do for that income Id both look at hours worked and at how much fun the work was and will be. Going forward some of that work should also be a good solid administration of costs and earnings (date spent/received item(s) bought/sold or services received *and* storing the proof like bank statements for multiple years). Maybe thats more boring to her than the trading but it doesnt have to take long. So given all that your wife should be able to decide whether she wants to continu doing this and if so whether on the same scale or perhaps a bit less (or more?).  Something else: to reduce the tax burden (also still for 2021) your wife could decide to put some of her earned money into a traditional IRA. Or she could decide to reduce her *future* tax burden by putting money in a Roth IRA.

If at some point this becomes a true little company she can also look into opening a self-employed retirement account in which one can put even more per year in a tax friendly way.

If the GP has an echo machine in the office that doesn’t require a pre authorization from insurance company in advance then it sounds like you went to a one stop shop set up to maximize annual billing.  You need a specialized technician to run that test and it usually costs $1800 or so with insurance.  Not sure how they ran that test for such a low price.  And who was the cardiologist who read the results or is the GP acting as a cardiologist too?

If the doctor says you need it you need it. It’s not like people go out and do cardiogram tests for funsies.

r3pm4w,hmecrst,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,DoomBuggE,11/28/2021,7.0,More like my employer is. The cost difference of my plan vs my employer’s HSA plan is $6/month for family coverage. I’m OK paying $72/year to not worry about a deductible.  Even if I was purchasing my own plan the cost difference would be $2400/year for my family of 3. Yet I would then have an individual deductible of $7K and a family deductible of $14K.  Looking back on the last 3 years of health expenses my daughter would have hit her deductible this year. My husband and daughter would have each hit their deductible last year and I would have hit mine in 2019. My pregnancy and delivery in 2019 was planned but everything else was not.  If I was on the HDHP I would have spent $28000 in deductibles in 3 years. If I had invested the premium difference in an HSA I’d still be coming out quite behind with the HDHP.
r3pm4w,hmdi1aq,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,thunfremlinc,11/28/2021,-6.0,Sounds like a shite physician. That should all be readily apparent in any patient system they have.

r3pm4w,hmfcsta,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,MsJenX,11/28/2021,1.0,Yeah you can totally ask to lower the price and make sure you explain the situation with your insurance.   A while back I went to my dentist because I thought I had an issue with an old root canal that he had worked on. There was in fact an infection so he cleaned an old root canal. He didn’t realize I had bad dental insurance that barely covered anything and he felt bad that I would have to pay $800 out of pocket. He offered to reduce the price to $400.

My last doctor’s receptionist asked whether I was going to bring up any issues or questions because an annual physical had no copay but if I brought up any concerns it couldn’t be coded as an annual and I would have to pay a copay for the visit. What is the point of an annual physical if you aren’t allowed to mention any minor symptoms that have come up in the last year?! How is it preventative to discourage patients from providing the doctor information that might help them diagnose an illness early?!
r3pm4w,hmeibrr,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,nautilator44,11/28/2021,1.0,Yeah my employer has an HDHP but then gives you most of the deductible in an HSA every year so its a better deal.

r3pm4w,hmdix28,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,WizardOfIF,11/28/2021,4.0,Ive negotiated a lot of medical bills. Its usually easier to do before they bill your insurance but it is still possible to to do so afterwards. I find it is usually best to be honest with them (let them know you werent expecting it to be so expensive) and ask if there is anything they can do to help you out. Dont make demands and be prepared for them to say no.  If they dont offer an immediate discount at your first request sometimes if you tell them youll need a payment plan in order to pay it off theyll follow up with a discount for being able to settle the balance in full.  Ive only once had a doctors office refuse to work with me on a bill when I felt like I was being overcharged and that was the last time I visited that practice.
r3pm4w,hmeheig,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,DoomBuggE,11/28/2021,2.0,Yes - often when my office has places IUDs our docs like to do a quick bedside sono to check positioning. BUT we don’t scan the image into the chart otherwise the patient gets charged $200-$300 for a 30 second ultrasound that isn’t medically essential but the doc likes to do simply for reassurance. At least they didn’t send you for repeat formal ultrasounds with radiology each time - those are easily $2K-$3K per scan.

r3pm4w,hme1dj0,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,too_too2,11/28/2021,2.0,Yeah this seems very weird I had to get an echo once when I was younger and had bad insurance. It was definitely a separately scheduled procedure and it was at the hospital vs the office. Also I’ve worked for a hospital system for many years and I agree with the other poster this is a little fishy.  You should request copies of your records from this office and go to a totally different place and see if there was even any reason to run an EKG or echo in the first place.

r3pm4w,hmdc8u8,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,pajam,11/28/2021,3.0,We just switched my wife onto my HDHP. Deductible is $6k/year for both of us ($3K per person) but my company also has an HRA (Health Reimbursement Arrangement) where they cover over a third of that deductible themselves so our deductible is really about $1700/year per person before that kicks in and the company pays the rest. Also the company gives each of us $840/year in our HSA tax free. So at the end of the day as long as I stick with in network providers my max out-of-pocket is about $900 (and that is tax free money too). After that no coinsurance no secret gotchas nothing.

r3pm4w,hme3c3u,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,kerbaal,11/28/2021,5.0,> change your plan from HDHP to PPO then schedule it for next year.  If an out of pocket charge of $700 is a lot for you then take this advice.  High deductible plans can make a lot of sense if you can afford to pay out of pocket up front and still put money away to save. Then you can get one of the special tax deferred investment accounts that only people with high deductibles health insurance qualify for.  In fact I would say anybody who cant do that is absolutely being screwed by high deductible plans. Its a plan for people who are well off and making a lot of money. Its disgusting to even offer them to anyone else.
r3pm4w,hmegvep,Charged $700 for echo doctor gave me no option about,DoomBuggE,11/28/2021,2.0,The EKG prints out the actual waveform readings with a little blurb explaining what the machine has detected (hopefully “normal sinus” but in OPs case it would say something else). Often the written blurb will show up on an electronic patient portal but you can also ask for a copy of the full waveform printout. Since this GP has an EKG and an echo machine on site I wouldn’t be surprised if they charge a per page fee to get a copy.

I worked out the numbers on our choices and the monthly premium on the PPO is so high that the HDHP ends up cheaper at the end of the year even if we end up paying out the full family deductible AND the max out-of-pocket for the HDHP - and once you hit the deductible the HDHP pays the same percentage as the PPO. PLUS with the HDHP we can do an HSA so I cant imagine why anyone at our company would ever choose the PPO.

So their paycheck is legally correct as their current rate is the rate agreed to by both parties. The company could not go back and take money away and say it was an incorrect amount. The fault lies with the employer not adjusting the pay rate after the OP stepped down.

The property owner is responsible for seeing that all water delivered to the property is properly registered on a meter and is paid for. An owner of any parcel of property which is connected to the Citys water distribution system shall be deemed knowingly to accept water service to the parcel on the terms and conditions specified in the City Charter.

You lost money in the stock market thinking it would last forever even when most stocks and indexes are at historical highs over last couple of years and keep climbing? Wtf did you invest into?  2. You were advised by the utility to take pics of meters one week after assuming ownership when the gas leak was discovered... And you decided to ignore the advice and now surprise_pikachu_face.jpeg you owe the utility more money than you should? Again wtf?  Im concerned by lack of judgement here. Hope these are learning points because a lot of things can go wrong with a house if you dont do proper diligence and maintenance.

In my state any utility balances are owed by the account holder with the utility company not the owner of the property but once utilities are shut off they cannot be turned back on until the balance is paid even if it is a new account holder.  But in other states the laws are written differently sometimes they heavily favor the utility companies other times they do not.  In other states the debt is directly tied to the property and the name on the account is just for billing purposes but when the name on the account is changed any balances carry over.  There are probably dozens of different systems for how billing and debt is managed by utility companies but often they are legally treated very differently then normal companies.

If you believe it will go back up within 5-10 years that is an option.   If you are getting dividends from the stock you can keep those and re-invest it into some other stock.   You can also sell the stock and re-invest it into another stock that has performed well OR is likely to grow more w/ dividends/increases in price.

I have never heard of anyone purchasing a property without first seeing inside. Your basically saying just trust what the bank wants.

The utility company “estimating” usage for two years and then trying to pass on a previously incurred debt on somebody else’s contract is some serious BS. Where was the utility company when you established your account at that address? That’s when they verify the meter and document the start of your account from that reading. Did they even bother coming out? Did you save your paperwork from them when you went in and initiated service?

Mine specifically outlines that the seller will have made all utility warranty and contracted payments up to date before our date of possession which then we will take over. Anything outstanding must be forwarded to the seller to pay. These are legal documents with multiple witnesses involved so you should have plenty of room to fight that battle.

r3rq09,hme7fti,"Didnt get a meter reading when i closed on my house, now electric company wants me to pay 800$ for previous owners usage",minze,11/28/2021,2.0,This is incorrect depending on where you are. In a lot of jurisdictions utilities are considered automatic liens and stay with the property much like HOA dues. For example in Philadelphia both water and natural gas are property debt and remain with the property no matter who the owner is. So yes a property can “own” a debt.   It’s actually simpler for the utility company. The debt is with the asset no matter the owner or tenant usually. It’s why I as a landlord keep the water bill in my name and subscribe to the landlord cooperation program with the gas company. With the gas company being part of the LCP allows you to split the debt off the property when needed. In return I agree to provide the utility access to the property whenever needed (generally for shutoff requirements).
r3rq09,hmes8rc,"Didnt get a meter reading when i closed on my house, now electric company wants me to pay 800$ for previous owners usage",InfernoExpedition,11/28/2021,2.0,In many states utilities are required to get an actual meter reading on change of tenant.  In some states it is not required but there are other requirements that a utility must not have more than X (often 2) monthly estimates in a row.  Estimating for 2 years in a row is meter reading malpractice.  There could be many reasons for this...if your utility still reads meters using humans COVID threw a wrench in that process.  If your utility recently implemented a fancy AMI infrastructure (automated metering infrastructure) they are often unreliable at first and it takes a while to get all the meters on the grid to report automatically every day.  A cursory review of the NY rules suggest that the utility needs to aggressively attempt to get an actual reading after 6 consecutive estimates:  Specifically PSC rules require the company to make a special effort to get an accurate reading after six months of estimated bills.  [Link](https://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/BE2766592D3CDD9885257687006F3959)  Also NY appears to require an actual reading on tenant change:  an actual reading has to be taken when service is canceled  [Link](https://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/979df87f099d1063852576880061e6b3/d580f8b12cdac9f985257687006f395e)  So...it appears your utility has broken two fundamental rules of reading meters in the state of New York.  There are typically two types of complaints from a utility point of view.  Customer complaints (yours) and Commission complaints (if you were to complain to the NY Public Service Commission).  Commission complaints are a PITA for utilities as they need to meticulous follow up and reporting on resolution to the commission.  Bottom line...if you are not getting anywhere talking to the utility contact the NY Public Service Commission and your utility will likely become much more responsive.  As for the $800 I would contact the utility and tell them that I plan to make a formal commission complaint and that I believe they have violated state rules.  I would formally dispute the charges with the utility.  If their billing system is any good that puts those charges off to the side and takes them out of the credit/disconnection process until the dispute is resolved.  If they still refuse you may consider asking for a Payment Arrangement while the dispute makes its way through the commission complaint process.  That would allow the payments to be spread over several months to reduce the amount youd have to claw back later....or if you are fine trying to claw it back pay the amount and then ask for it back later.

So i sent that in around july or the first week of august and the next bill showed i used a crazy amount of gas. The bill showed my reading i sent in as actual and listed the previous reading date as 2019.

Then last week i got the disconnection notice for dec 02. Called them again they said ok well well put a hold on the account and I asked for a supervisor (nicely not like a karen) and the guy said ok and put me on a short hold and then said someone would call me back right away cause its more complicated than they first thought that was the day before thanksgiving and their office is closed until monday so if i get a call back from them it would be tomarrow but I made the post to know what to do if they dont fix it and if i should pay the bill or not

As a buyer you can pay for anything you want to take place. You want an inspection a lead paint analysis a sewer line inspection etc. You can pay to have it done. The seller could object to intrusive or damaging tests but standard inspections are fine. On any house under loan the bank will require inspections title insurance etc. In foreclosure its up to you.

Ultimately skipping the inspection and offering $35k over asking did the trick. And this was in Kansas.

They don’t let you look because it helps drive the price up (gambling) and is a condition of the sale. “It doesn’t exist because I haven’t heard of it” is a pretty arrogant take whether you wanted it to sound that way or not. It in fact does happen and a buyer (especially one paying cash and not using a bank) can very much be at the mercy of their own knowledge or ignorance.

It is state specific.  I work in the industry and recall this being a rule in Colorado...the debt stays with the property like a lien.  I cannot recall any other state I have worked where that was the case.  Usually if there is a debt on the property it just means that the person moving in will have to go through a more complicated application process to prove they are not the old tenants child dog etc. just trying to keep service on and avoid the debt.

They never reduced my pay after I stepped down from being a supervisor I didn’t say anything expecting at some point they’d realize their mistake and my paycheck would just be lower one day. They eventually figured it out something like a year later right as I was about to quit so I didn’t stay long enough to care. They never gave me my last paycheck though so presumably they took it from that. I suspect I could’ve fought against that but it’s been so long now and it’s not worth the time and effort it’d take to recoup (it was a reduced paycheck anyways for a fraction of a pay period).

Definitely do a bit more reading on federal and state taxes in the near future (ideally before filing 2021 taxes next year). Its a convoluted system and it always helps to have a primer on how marginal taxes work whats deductible vs not how different retirements accounts are taxed now vs in the future etc. <5 hours of reading will put you ahead of a majority of the country so its well worth it and will help a lot with future planning. Many state taxes diverge from federal rules as well so its good to know the major differences for your state if thats applicable.

r3rnhi,hmf6b6o,Am I doing enough to save for my future? PLEASE HELP.,SwordfishTough,11/28/2021,1.0,>At $185K I am at the 32% tax rate. To qualify for the lower tax bracket I’d need around $21000 in deductions. With my current numbers I’ll have around $18000. Should I increase my retirement contributions to be taxed at the lower rate? Is it worth it? Is that what people do? Or am I being greedy?  Youre mean at the 32% _marginal_ rate so only income from $170k-$185k is taxed at 32%. If you take the standard deduction on your taxes and also have $18k of deductions none of your income is being taxed at 32% already (your AGI is actually under $155k and youre in the 24% marginal bracket). Even if you take more deductions you only save taxes on the amount that you deduct not on your entire income. Just want to point this out because a lot of people think that taxes are holistic e.g. if youre in the 32% bracket then all of your income is taxed at that percent. In reality its a marginal system so only a fraction of your income is taxed that highly.  Separately  - $2000 is a lot in fun money. Cutting this down will help you get to your goals sooner.  - what are you doing about the $1200 remaining? Also it should be closer to $2000 left over given your income.
r3rnhi,hmdtkwz,Am I doing enough to save for my future? PLEASE HELP.,isaacbunny,11/28/2021,5.0,Why are you not maxing out your 401k? This is a clear miss. Leverage tax-advantaged accounts to retire early and happy.    $2000/mo for “personal fun” is a godawful amount of money and clearly a place to budget better.  Most importantly you’re not accounting for about most of your budget. You listed a $185k salary and $120k worth of savings and expenses. Where is the rest going? You aren’t paying 32% in taxes on your full salary. You’re missing tens of thousands somewhere.
r3rnhi,hmf4pqw,Am I doing enough to save for my future? PLEASE HELP.,BoredintheHouse0,11/28/2021,1.0,No worries! You’re not crapping on it.  I studied Computer Science and Philosophy at a Top 50 school (though I don’t think school ranking really matters). My school was not a target school so I networked on LinkedIn for a year. I built up my portfolio gained a good following and started a business that spread like wildfire during COVID. I am no longer holding onto that business but I used it as leverage to eventually recreate the whole front end platform of the company I now work for and send it directly to the recruiter via cold-email.  She was impressed and hired me. By luck they placed me in the cyber security department of the company. They were going to pay me $88000/year. But it seemed off for this particular company because I knew of new grads making $150000/year. So I talked to my boss gave him $185K as a number expected that he’d come back with $165K but he accepted the $185K.  I do work in FAANG.

r3npau,hmea5ee,I stepped down from my position but they never changed my wage,mtkaliz,11/28/2021,1.0,Always say something if you think your pay is wrong. Imagine if they had forgotten to pay you - you would speak up right quick. Do the exact same if the shoe is on the other foot.   However in this case I do not believe that they made a mistake. In the interview where you agreed with HR and your manager to step away from being a supervisor they should (or you should) have brought up salary. Since no one did AND if the meeting was documented you can safely assume that your pay isn’t changing.   About that documentation - every time you meet with HR and your boss either request documentation of what was discussed OR send out an email outlining your understanding of what was discussed. EVERY TIME.   Good luck!
r3nrwf,hmf2zl5,FICO vs VantageScore. Which one matters/most accurate?,CorrectPeanut5,11/28/2021,1.0,It depends on what youre attempting to get credit for. FICO is the dominant player and they have several models. The FICO score you see disclosed from a credit report is different than the FICO score used for auto loans which is different from the FICO score you see for a home loan.   In addition a lender may customize the FICO algorithm so its tailored to their customer base.    Be that as it may if youre getting disclosed a 800 FICO odds are you have great credit.
r3qnog,hmfkxvk,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,EmergencyGap9,11/28/2021,1.0,No there aren’t. Deadlift is an exceptional full body workout and there isn’t a workout like it(other than maybe sumo squats) squats will build stability and develop your legs overall better than any exercise (including hack squat leg press etc) and bench is 100% the best exercise for creating a more muscular full chest- and simply working your chest out. If you’re at the gym and want to exercise any of these body parts- these are the exercises to learn.   Yes my point is op should be asking fitness minded people not accountants- about whether or not a decent gym is worth it since op has clearly worked out and is unhappy with the racks at their gym. My mentality being if you have more complaints about a gym than you have enjoyment the average person will use those complaints as an excuse. Then the $10 is less worth it than the $30 as ops physical and mental health from exercise is now resting on a $20 decision. Goofy.  I’m not saying you HAVE to do these big 3 what I am saying is people who act like you can get the same results from not doing them as doing them are simply wrong and it’s similar to the idea that people will get the same results from a workout without failure as they will to a workout with failure.

It all falls on tax code and how the organization/company is set up.  I see this as completely normal from our personal past experience.

The money the I put in goes into a 403b and the money they match goes into a 401k.,OathOfFeanor,11/28/2021,1.0,I cant find the actual regulation verbiage but I am pretty sure the IRS only allows employer matching funds to go into a traditional 401k nothing else.  So far all I can find is this page which confirms that it must be a pre-tax account (even if you have chosen the Roth treatment for your own contributions):  https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/matching-contributions-help-you-save-more-for-retirement
r3p31h,hmevfn7,"Should I get rid of all my credit cards and just use a 2nd debit card as my ""credit card""?",unbalancedcheckbook,11/28/2021,1.0,I wouldnt unless you are unable to control yourself when it comes to buying things on credit.   If you can treat your credit cards like payment cards (never buy what you cant pay for right now and never carry a balance) they are pretty good financial tools.  They can help raise your credit score and the cashback or other rewards will be better than debit cards.   Fraud protection tends to be better on credit cards as well.  As for Dave Ramsey theres a certain kind of person that needs to listen to Dave mainly WASPy emotional spenders.    Hes AA for the suburban debt up to my eyeballs set.   If youre not one of those people there is far better advice elsewhere.

r3p31h,hmdcooa,"Should I get rid of all my credit cards and just use a 2nd debit card as my ""credit card""?",VegasOldPerv,11/28/2021,2.0,I have no clue what you are trying to say.   A credit score is not designed for you or me. It is designed to help lenders assess their risk exposure in lending you money or extending you credit. It is a tried and true indication of the likelihood that we will pay our bills. That can extend to responsibility with rent and insurance also. If you have zero credit then that risk factor is unknown. You could be denied or charged extra without a credit score.
r3p31h,hmeczji,"Should I get rid of all my credit cards and just use a 2nd debit card as my ""credit card""?",ThekingofShibauni777,11/28/2021,2.0,I reccomend using a credit card and I know thats not my money so Im less inclined to spend it I leave my debit cards at home and save quite a but more weekly with this tactic plus well earning the cashback rewards this does take displine but in case of fruad your credit card company will most likely have to cover you.

Could be a nonprofit with business income or depending on the structure of the company and the funding it wouldnt be shocking to have that type of match setup in the admin spending on the functional expense side versus letting your contributions hit the 403B from a program spending side.   Saw some of these systems when auditing nonprofit and it never was an issue
r3qnog,hmdo3gx,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,raisuki,11/28/2021,1.0,You’re a college student - do what makes you feel good. Although being smart about your money is great early I honestly consider college a lost cause unless you’re an entrepreneur with a company already under your belt.   From what I’m seeing it’ll be money well spent. I always say money is generally worth it even though I’m frugal if it’s for your health - $30 is pretty standard for a normal gym with basic stuff.
r3qnog,hmddh8z,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,yellowcanvas,11/28/2021,1.0,I mostly live in sweatpants and sweatshirts right now because I’ve gained weight since getting injured. But i did get some clothes that were on sale for black friday!  I go for runs and do bodyweight exercises but I used to lift a lot when I had a home gym. Yes the campus gym is inconvenient but the hoards of creepy frat boys that approach girls and film us working out are the main deterrent. There aren’t any creeps at the gym i was thinking of joining according to my couple friends who go there and it’s a small but close community.

r3nfrl,hmdflue,Is there a source to see how much money can be expected to receive through social security? (USA),retirementinsanity,11/28/2021,2.0,Just a little addition since the social security question is answered. You should also go to https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs and see how the rates are going since the premium will be auto-deducted from the social security check. In 2022 the base rate is $170.10 for part B.   And of course you need to keep in mind where you are in relation to the taxability of social security payments.
r3qnog,hmer470,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,EmergencyGap9,11/28/2021,1.0,This depends on your fitness level and mentality more than anything personalfinance probably isn’t the place to ask this. For me lifting and exercising has always been my solace- so at one point when I was traveling for work I had 3 gym memberships costing me over $100 a month… And I was happy to pay it. I currently go to a gym thats $50 a month rather than Planet Fitness (which is about 3 miles further away) a gym I hate as I’m the Lunk described in their “we don’t judge people unless you’re these types of people then we judge people”.   To me the gym is about mental and physical health and wellness so I would go to whatever gym motivated me to go push myself and put in effort the most. If you’re an avid gym-goer find a gym you like. If you’re the type who goes for 40 mins eight times a month spends more effort stretching than lifting then just go to any gym.
r3qnog,hmfgyar,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,EmergencyGap9,11/28/2021,1.0,Asked financial advice based on whether or not they should pay for a gym membership- even mentioned racks. You gave gym advice based on what little you’re aware of saying to just save money and not do the best exercises for their specific body parts. That’s goofy gym advice based on finances and this isn’t the place to ask whether or not it’s worth it based on ops fitness- because people like you are going to answer with bad lazy fitness advice.
r3qnog,hmdcgik,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,ppardee,11/28/2021,1.0,Why are you thinking about spending $30 on what is literally a luxury when you havent covered the basics yet?? **Buy some freaking clothes!!**  This is gonna sound really judge-y and harsh but you sound like youre already making excuses not to workout.  The campus gym is not ideal and its inconvenient.  So does that mean that youre not going to go to the gym you sign up for when its inconvenient or imperfect? Whats stopping you from working out right now without a gym?    Most gym memberships go unused.  Only you can say whether you will use it or not - but most people think they will when they first sign up.  Is it worth it? Probably not.  But as long as theres no long-term contract and they dont have some absurdly complex cancellation process theres little risk to trying.    Now go buy some pants!
r3qnog,hmfhpb6,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,PM_ME_GLUTE_SPREAD,11/28/2021,1.0,He was asking this question in personal finance. I answered it with the mindset of “what makes the most sense financially”. Had he asked it in /r/fitness or /r/weightroom I would have answered differently.   And what makes bench squat and deadlift the “best exercises for their specific body parts”? Bench squat and deadlift make you better at bench squat and deadlift. You’ll build chest tri leg back etc muscles but there are far more efficient ways to build muscle than just doing the big 3.
r3qnog,hme8eqp,Is a $30/month gym membership worth it?,woollywhelk,11/28/2021,1.0,All gyms are hard to cancel. PF was easier for me to cancel than LA Fitness but still requires a certified letter.

But when looking to save a few bucks on a gym membership when you aren’t even sure what you want out of a gym b/s/d is completely unnecessary.   >This is why you don’t ask for gym advice on personalfinance.

The money the I put in goes into a 403b and the money they match goes into a 401k.,dequeued,11/28/2021,4.0,Theyre *very* similar with a few minor differences. The main one that is a positive thing is that some 403(b) plans allow some people with 15+ years of service at the company/organization to contribute up to $3000 extra per year (its a separate thing from the more well-known age 50+ catch-up contributions for 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans).

r47c3y,hmeuwfp,Why is there an income limit to contribute to roth IRA's but not traditional IRA's?,BouncyEgg,11/28/2021,11.0,Because that’s the way the law was written.  Tax code is full of nonsensicals.

r47c3y,hmeuyqk,Why is there an income limit to contribute to roth IRA's but not traditional IRA's?,xaradevir,11/28/2021,2.0,Cause thats how the laws were written and the IRS wants its tax money.  Note that traditional IRAs DO have an applicable income limit unless you have zero participation the entire tax year in an employer-sponsored qualified plan (participation includes receiving any employer contributions to your account).  Also note that the backdoor Roth procedure that currently exists means you can always get money into a Roth IRA regardless of income (though existing pre-tax IRA balances at year-end will interfere).

r47c3y,hmf64ii,Why is there an income limit to contribute to roth IRA's but not traditional IRA's?,shadow_chance,11/28/2021,2.0,It actually can be a decent answer. A lot of what Congress does is due to budget rules.   Wiki for the Roth IRA says:   > In 1997 Roth wanted to restore the traditional IRA which had been repealed in 1986 and the upfront tax deduction that goes with it. Under congressional budget rules which worked within a 10-year window the revenue cost of giving that tax break to everyone was too high so his staff limited deductible IRAs to people with very low income and made Roth IRAs (initially with income limitations) available to others. This slid the revenue cost outside the 10-year window and got the legislation out from under the budget rules.

We are 38 and 36. We have a financial advisor that we opened when my spouse needed to roll over their 401K out of their last employment. We were not sure if we could do this without an advisor. We then opened up IRAs with this advisor. We now have a son we plan to start a 529 plan for and plan to do this also with an advisor. Do we need a financial advisor to do all of these things? Picking out what to invest in is not the issue I am just not sure where to go to do this myself. We also want to open up a nonretirement account investing in mutual funds. Are mutual funds the same as index funds? Let me know if you need more information.
r47ecv,hmeuwzh,Do I need a financial advisor?,StingrayRaider,11/28/2021,2.0,Nope you should be able to figure all those things out within an hour on your own for free.  Rolling over a 401k to an IRA will probably take under 15 minutes way less if you use Fidelity or somewhere that it’s super easy.  Then open a 529 and add money (I think it’s that easy haven’t done it though).

r47c3y,hmezp70,Why is there an income limit to contribute to roth IRA's but not traditional IRA's?,m3003,11/28/2021,11.0,because thats how the law was written is not an answer. I dont know why people are so obtuse.  The law was written that way to encourage lower income and middle class people to invest.

The 60000th dollar of income put in a roth is only taxed at 24%. The 5 millionth dollar... much higher. Youd see a substantial hit to tax revenue if Roths didnt have an income limit.

With a roth ira you pay taxes upfront so you dont pay taxes on contributions and earnings.   With a traditional ira contributions are tax deductible but withdrawals are subject to income tax.
r47c3y,hmeurcm,Why is there an income limit to contribute to roth IRA's but not traditional IRA's?,Default87,11/28/2021,2.0,because non deductible IRA contributions are a thing.  Given current tax code they are not a good idea for long term investing and their only real use currently is as an intermediary step in the backdoor process.  Note that while there is no income limitation to contributing to a traditional IRA there is an income limit on being able to deduct those contributions (if you are covered by a workplace retirement plan).

r47ay1,hmewk64,Can I afford a 15 year loan?,alan_grant93,11/28/2021,-2.0,A few thoughts:  1) Have you talked with a mortgage officer? They can run all kinds of scenarios so you can compare - various term lengths down payments etc. They’ll also include escrow - that adds about 13-15% to our mortgage payment. Does your $800 payment include escrow? Your payment might be more like $900-$950 per month.  2) 30 year mortgages are very interest-heavy. We started with a 30 and it was going to take 16 years (!!!) before principal and interest payments were equal and we would have paid almost double what we took out. We refinanced to a 15 year (with lower interest) - payments went up about $220 but we’ll save $160k in interest AND be done in 15 years (instead of the original 30.)  Personally I’d rather have a paid-for home than some extra money in investments. I know I need a house to live in in 15 years.

r46sny,hmetnty,Investing for Beginners,unchinhairs,11/28/2021,1.0,What is your 401k and HSA invested in? If youre saving for retirement it helps to think of all your retirement accounts as one giant portfolio. So come up with a plan for your accounts as a whole then figure out how each account is set up in alignment with the plan.  If you want to save more specifically for retirement you should consider an IRA (traditional or Roth is a separate decision). An IRA is tax-advantaged compared to a taxable brokerage.

Our previous $300/mo car payment required about $200 for gas/maintenance/insurance and our current $600/mo car payment requires about $300/mo for those things.
r46i50,hmf4ep7,Need some help putting a down payment on a car,sentient_lamp_shade,11/28/2021,3.0,Former pro mechanic here:  The car you can afford based on your description is likely to be more trouble than its worth. All those cars at small lots usually have been through the auction cycle a whole bunch of times. They have a bunch of hidden gremlins that no other dealers wanted to pass onto their customers.  Id advise you get a moped. Theyre $1000 brand new with a warranty. Yep I know its uncomfortable uncool ect. However they are a lot of fun they cost nothing to run and you are guaranteed transportation. Best of all when you have saved for a decent car you can turn around and sell if for very close to what you paid for it if you kept it nice. You could also keep it so that in the event your main car goes down it doesnt metastasize into getting fired ect.  Once you have more than 5 grand Id look for a private sale car with as few owners as possible. Ask if they have service records. If they do thats a great sign. any one who is so meticulous that they wrote down every time they changed the oil will definitely have changed the oil on time. You should take your time and look for a great car for the money and if you have the aforementioned moped you have that luxury. Once you have it pay someone to pump out every fluid and filter it has change all the rubber parts you can afford and get the lay of the land. A lot of problems can be avoided by just checking the fluids.   Best of luck

r46wzm,hmetpl0,Can your mortgagor overcharge you on the property tax and is there a way to stop them from doing it?,RoastyMcGiblets,11/28/2021,0.0,Theres a legal limit to how much they can hold in escrow. They are allowed to hold an overage equal to two months cushion (IIRC). Based on actual tax and insurance costs.   But if someone quoted you an early estimate before closing and it turned out to be incorrect nothing you can do about that. You have to pay what the actual taxes are.   Sometimes people look at taxes on vacant land and dont realize that they will go up dramatically once a house is built. Sometimes people look at what the sellers of a house paid in taxes and dont realize those people had exemptions that wont transfer (usually age related).   Its unclear from your post what really happened here TBH.

When we bought our house prices in our neighborhood had increased about 25% and even though taxes hadn’t increased yet our mortgage company collected more from us in anticipation of property taxes increasing. Glad they did - when the assessment came out a few months later taxes were up about $1200/year.  If your mortgage company is wrong they’ll reduce what you owe in escrow periodically. We’ve owned our house three years and escrow payments have gone up… then down… now back up again…

Are the comps recently sold comps with enough time to pay the updated tax amount? Are you looking at zillow or county records?   Property taxes are typically reassessed when you acquire the property. The estimated property taxes should have been in all your disclosures during the loan process. The loaning bank does this as a business. If they’re withholding a certain amount for property taxes I presume it’ll be relatively close not 500%
r46wzm,hmeu4d3,Can your mortgagor overcharge you on the property tax and is there a way to stop them from doing it?,na3than,11/28/2021,3.0,Youre not really being charged for property tax by your lender. They accumulate that in an escrow account for you and theyll pay it to the county twice per year as required similar to your employer withholding a portion of your pay and sending it to the IRS for income tax payments. At the end of the year theyll reassess how much they escrowed and how much they paid out and refund the difference to you (or notify you of the shortfall which you can pay all at once or pay monthly throughout the next year by increasing your monthly payment).  Tldr your lender doesnt profit from your escrowed property taxes.
r46wzm,hmf4n0r,Can your mortgagor overcharge you on the property tax and is there a way to stop them from doing it?,DJKrafty,11/28/2021,2.0,I did a lot of research on the county assessors site for multiple homes in the area and the taxes were pretty average based on the cost of their homes and the variances in the assessed value changed by a dollar of two on all the properties over the last few years. I know I have to wait it out but I was hoping to engage some smarter folks than me that might know something I hadnt found yet.
r46wzm,hmfamjb,Can your mortgagor overcharge you on the property tax and is there a way to stop them from doing it?,DJKrafty,11/28/2021,1.0,I was using the county assessors site to research records and taxes for the area. The tax rate shows as 0.32 ± 0.04% in the county averaging $609. I was then dividing the amount for my property by 12 to account for a monthly average cost which came out to $58. ($635 for 2020 $634 for 2019) so when I received the mortgage breakdown in our paperwork I noticed that the escrow total was coming out to $262 which doesnt add up considering our insurance ($718)and property taxes ($635 +/- $10 to be conservative) should equate out to ($1358 for the year$113.17 per month) but with their charges the cost of the taxes and insurance for the 6 months of this year (May 28th 2021 was the start of our mortgage) to a total of $1572. Considering that at closing we paid the insurance premium for the year the costs do not add up and I think its utter bullshit to have to pay extra to just get it back when they reassess and see how much they were overcharging.

We tried to get it fixed but they said it was their standard practice to collect a conservative 1.5% of the cost of the home since it hadnt been assessed recently. Taxes over the last two years increased by 1 dollar......  Is there any way to get them to stop this overcharge? I know I can wait for the county assessor to submit their finding but thats another 6 months from now and its going to end up costing me an extra $2000 out of my standard budget.
r46wzm,hmet6re,Can your mortgagor overcharge you on the property tax and is there a way to stop them from doing it?,robb0995,11/28/2021,4.0,First off just for future reference you’re the mortgagor when you borrow money because a mortgage is the pledge to pay to the money and you’re the one making the pledge. The lender is the mortgagee.   Pedantry aside you can: * choose a different lender * waive escrow if you meet the lender’s criteria to manage your own tax payments (and possibly pay a fee that you can probably roll into the loan) or  * just wait for it all to be sorted out at the first escrow analysis in a year.   That’s about it on your options.
r46wzm,hmerldu,Can your mortgagor overcharge you on the property tax and is there a way to stop them from doing it?,Knipfty,11/28/2021,6.0,You can ask but they generally want to have a cushion in case taxes rise (which they generally do).

r46wzm,hmf4jbz,Can your mortgagor overcharge you on the property tax and is there a way to stop them from doing it?,j-christopher,11/28/2021,2.0,How much is collected upfront depends on the relationship between your closing date and when the tax installments are due.  As u/Werewolfdad points out the annual escrow analysis is there specifically to iron out over/under-collections from the previous year.    The monthly amount that goes into escrow will change (a little or a lot) every year depending on whats happened with your property tax bill and insurance premiums since the last analysis.

I found them with data backed by the assessors and they still charged me ridiculously. I was hoping to find some other answer than what I had already found. It looks like I just have to wait it out until the assessor submits for the upcoming year. I was reading and it looks like they assess every other year but that doesnt hold up with the data available so I was hoping to not have to eat the extra cost for an extended amount of time when Im just going to get it back at the end of all of this.

r47ay1,r47ay1,Can I afford a 15 year loan?,BlunderMeister,11/28/2021,3.0,   Hey guys  I have a wife + son. We are a single-family income. My wife is taking care of our 5-year-old at home however does plan to pursue a second income some time in the near future (2-3 years). I dont know what that would look like but to lowball it lets say she brings in an extra 20k gross. I make 54k a year before taxes. We live in a small town in Kansas so luckily things are very affordable even on a single income.  We are buying a house and could not be more excited! We are buying it for 85k and will have a 5% down payment. We are very fortunate to have zero debts. Our car is paid off and we do not have any student loan debt credit cards or any other personal debts in our names.  If you guys were in our situation would you go for a 15 year loan? Ive crunched the numbers and it will be anywhere from 750-800 a month. Right now I am bringing in anywhere from 2600-2800 a month after taxes depending on the side income I make. Right now we are paying 600 a month for rent. I am fully aware that there are other costs to home ownership in addition to the extra 150-200 dollars we would be paying a month. I am confident that our income in the future will grow especially when my wife starts earning a second income. What would you guys do in my situation?  I would love to pay off my house as soon as possible.

The bad thing is Im not sure if the large amount of overtime will be there in 2022.   &#x200B  All of my CC debt was paid off  I maxed out my Roth IRA for 2021  Maxed out my work pension to 17%  Have six months of an emergency fund  Managed to save about 40k. I have online savings that Ive been saving about 1k a month minimum and then any extras I put into the online savings as well.   &#x200B  Im 30 years old and still live at home. Id like to move out but I dont really have to right now. I dont pay rent just groceries once a month.   &#x200B  Major Bills:  Student loans will start up in January which will be about $350 a month.   $500 car lease payment a month (I had shitty credit a couple years ago when I got the car)   Food: About $300 a month (little higher since this is all I have to pay at home)  Phone: $105 a month  &#x200B  I have about 7k left to pay on my car lease and then my biggest debt would be my student loans which are about $50k. That number stresses me out and makes me feel like Ill never be able to move out and purchase my own home.   &#x200B  Do I go and pay a large amount down on that $50k number and then lose most of my savings that Ive been able to obtain this year or just continue to pay the loans off monthly? My goal is to have my own home but idk if I can at this point.   &#x200B  Thank you

r487vn,hmf0av1,Retirement options for someone who makes 24k?,LesterTheOne,11/28/2021,11.0,You will only be working as a cashier at 80 if that is the life you accept.   I’m assuming you are young. Never stop looking for the next job. Talk to friends anyone. 40 years to work is a long time to be stuck in one job path.   As for retirement. You could download the stash app and use their IRA option. Or your bank/credit union may have one. Google IRA.   Even $10-15 a week is better than nothing and adds up eventuality . Research learn and stick some money in long term etfs or good blue chip type stocks.

Not lavish by any means but secure enough to have a life if you keep rent low.  At that point increasing your savings brings you to FI earlier or more spending power in retirement.

I still have a bit to pay off. My utlization ratio is at 45% so high. My auto loan recently got paid off and was finally reported closed. I have opened a new auto loan but hasnt reported yet.So i was aware it would drop my score. Few days On expierian it showed 10 points dropped.  Now today I got an alert saying my score dropped 17 points. On my dashboard it still says the new score when it dropped 10 points but in scores section it says a lower different score. Which one is correct and why?
r47lae,hmfbkq0,Credit Score dropped twice? Need help understanding?,HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,11/28/2021,1.0,It will go back up over time just try to keep your utilization low. Pay it off and use it for one bill that you’ll always pay rather than using it for random expenses.

r47je7,hmf1qx8,"Should we buy a house? And if so, should we buy ready to move in or a fixer upper foreclosure?",Wandering_Lights,11/28/2021,1.0,It depends what all the foreclosurer needs.

We redid the flooring painted and deep cleaned before moving in. Once we moved in we redid one of the bathrooms with plans on redoing the second eventually.

r47je7,r47je7,"Should we buy a house? And if so, should we buy ready to move in or a fixer upper foreclosure?",JakeParry34,11/28/2021,1.0,Context: Wife and I (both 26 going on 27) are getting ready to buy a house. Current living situation is a rent-free apartment due to wives job but due to having 3 dogs and a desire to leave her current role we need to have our own space. Combined pre-tax income is roughly 100k before bonuses (housing expenses arent included in her salary. Job covers our rent as well as all utilities so call it additional 15k). Wife only has car loan (20k) and I have car loan + student loans (combined 55k).  Just using basic internet calculators based on our income + monthly expenditures we can afford up to about 250k without too much strain. That being said there is a foreclosure home in our desired area that is listed at 120k (already price dropped from 135k). If it were you would you purchase the foreclosure now with time to renovate/fix before moving in or would you wait and purchase something ready to move in? Any and all advice appreciated!

And if so, should we buy ready to move in or a fixer upper foreclosure?",JakeParry34,11/28/2021,1.0,Still need to visit and go over everything to be sure but from our understanding it’s mostly cosmetic. Luckily have family in the trades so most of the work to be done would be fairly affordable too. We do have some plans to map out about potentially adding a half bath but that remains to be seen (obviously would have to figure all that out)
r47je7,hmey5mc,"Should we buy a house? And if so, should we buy ready to move in or a fixer upper foreclosure?",HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,11/28/2021,2.0,I think it depends on how much you have saved up for your emergency fund and how much you have saved up for renovations.
r47h3q,hmewe5c,Beware credit cards saying they don't charge a foreign transaction fee.,Stable-McCafe,11/28/2021,3.0,Exchange rates are different everywhere (banks credit unions CC). Theyre not charging you foreign transaction fees which can be as high as $3 per ATM withdrawal or per transaction depending on the bank or credit card.   So theyre not the same thing.   Are they making money off of you on the exchange rate? Of course they are.. If you dont want that then youd have to exchange cash at a local bank which can be even worse. Google is showing market rates not actual bank exchange rates.

r47mre,hmf2493,Can there be two 50% mortgages on one house.,wrldruler21,11/28/2021,1.0,This all sounds like complications best written in a pre-nup contract.  A sentence that says the percent equity you each get at the time of sale will be proportional to the percent each of you paid into it.   In other words if you made 80% of the mortgage payments then you get 80% of the equity at sale.
r47mre,hmewz2j,Can there be two 50% mortgages on one house.,Randomstuff404,11/28/2021,1.0,There’s no way to split two separate first lien mortgages.  No bank would write this.  No investor would be ok with it.
r47mre,hmezi9i,Can there be two 50% mortgages on one house.,DeluxeXL,11/28/2021,5.0,There is a possibility. In contrast to a group mortgage a fractional mortgage or TIC mortgage (TIC = [Tenancy in Common](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/tenancy-in-common)) is used for each co-owner to borrow against his/her share of ownership. Each mortgage is only attached to each co-owners share. If B stops paying A is not on the hook for Bs past due payments. If Bs bank forecloses Bs share A still owns his/her share and can stay in the house. A might just have another person C as housemate if Bs bank auctions off Bs share to C.  Details matter. They need to talk to agents lenders or even real estate attorneys to get familiarized. Also this is not as common in residential settings so expect higher interest rates.
r47mre,hmevyvi,Can there be two 50% mortgages on one house.,HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,11/28/2021,1.0,If B might stop paying why buy a house? I wouldn’t do it unless you’re fully content and capable of paying for the entire mortgage.

Why not just have both parties pay the same minimum amount due?  If A has more funds there are better ways for that money to work for them than reducing interest owed on a 3% mortgage.
r47mre,hmey8gl,Can there be two 50% mortgages on one house.,jorge1209,11/28/2021,7.0,Unmarried people shouldnt buy houses if this is their concern it is just such a complicated nightmare of a situation.  If they split up you are already going to have a nightmare situation selling if one wants to maximize sale price and the other wants to close quickly and move on.  If they break up can he bring his new girlfriend in to live with him?  Who is paying for the kitchen remodel?  Who pays the utility bill when he is off in Vegas but she stays home through the snowstorm?  Nevermind everything about living with someone and all the normal fights that occur. You want to compound all that by worrying about accounting for prepay?!  In any case prepay is the least of the concerns. If A prepays it doesnt affect the actual monthly payment but rather just accelerates the mortgage. So take the original amortization schedule and divide it evenly that is the capital accrued to the party that doesnt prepay any difference between that and the actual capital accrued is the result of A prepaying. Its just an accounting exercise in the end and only modestly complicated if B also decides to prepay.

We got a single mortgage as far as the bank was concerned we were both responsible for everything. We went to a lawyer and got a cohabitation agreement essentially a contract that explained how we wanted to split the mortgage and home equity.   It worked well and forced us to communicate what our concerns were and what we wanted. In our case my wife put in a larger down payment and made smaller payments. We both got half the home equity and the mortgage would be split basically like we had two separate mortgages with different down payments and monthly payments. The lawyers fees were only a few hundred dollars so not much extra in terms of closing costs.

r458z0,r458z0,How likely am I to get financed through my same credit Union?,Michaeldavid198,11/28/2021,2.0,Hey all! Long story short I ended up purchasing a car 2 weeks ago that I’ve come to find out wasn’t what I was looking for. The credit Union that I used previously decided to keep me In financing the car I purchased 2 weeks ago.  Anyways The dealership that I purchased the car from wouldn’t work with me regarding an exchange so my next best thing was to sell it which thankfully I’m actually getting more than what I paid for. With that being said the cost of the other car that I’m purchasing is cheaper if that makes a difference. The credit Union that I’m using doesn’t open until tomorrow so I won’t find out until then but from the sounds of it do you think they’ll allow me to make this change? I mean I’ve always made my payments and have been a good customer for them. I know I won’t find out until tomorrow but I wanted to get some opinions to see if I’m not wasting my time. Thanks!   Side note: With the car being brand new I have yet to register it and all that stuff. Hopefully that doesn’t make a difference when the credit Union decides if they want to keep me or not.

r45f7i,r45f7i,403(b) Roth vs 529,friedrichpeachy,11/28/2021,2.0,My wife and I (both age 33) are in a pretty good financial spot (I think) but are now planning for retirement and up to 2 kids.  Debt:  - None just credit cards we pay off completely every month.  Combined Income:  - W2: 130k + 70k = 200k - 1099: 15k + 2k = 17k  Existing savings:  - Short term reserves (emergency fund/ working checking account for day-to-day): 40k - Roth IRA: 100k (Vanguard Target Retirement funds) - Roth 403(b): 120k (Fidelity/Vanguard Target Retirement funds) - non-tax-advantaged accounts at Vanguard in various index funds: 30k  Housing:   - own home outright in a rising COL area w/ good public schools dont anticipate moving or upsizing. Value ~ $700k. - Property tax/insurance/utilities: ~$1200/month  Current savings/investment strategy:  - Both partners max Roth IRA - Both partners max Roth 403(b) - My job (130k) has 403(b) match at 3x up to 5% (so I contribute 5% (6.5k) they contribute 15% (19.5k) if I contribute the max (19.5k) they still contribute 19.5k) - HSA not available through either employers benefits - Any extra savings would go to non-tax-advantaged vanguard brokerage account  My main question is as we plan for kids (assuming 2 born in the next 4 years) assuming we want to enable them to go to high-cost school if that makes sense for them without taking on a lot of debt should I contribute just 5% to my 403(b) maxing my employer match and put the remaining 10% Im currently using to max the 403(b) into a 529? Or is there something Im not thinking about? Also at this point should I think about moving towards traditional IRA/403b contributions?
r458z0,hmejav0,How likely am I to get financed through my same credit Union?,mdesaul,11/28/2021,1.0,This isn’t just with Credit Unions. This is with any bank or CU. If you have accounts with them and default they have rights of offset.   In reality it is really no different then getting a loan from a bank you don’t have accounts with and defaulting.  If you don’t have accounts at said bank they will sue and can garnish whatever accounts you do have.   The morale of the story here is pay your bills (like the OP says they do) and they won’t have any problems.
r458z0,hmej9lt,How likely am I to get financed through my same credit Union?,Michaeldavid198,11/28/2021,1.0,Thanks for that information! I didn’t know that’s what some of them do. Thankfully I only have a car loan with them but I can understand some risks may be involved. Regardless if I chose to finance with them do you think they’d allow me to make this change based off the information I provided? Thanks!
r458z0,hmen21j,How likely am I to get financed through my same credit Union?,j-christopher,11/28/2021,2.0,Yes if/when you do the trade the existing loan will be paid off and replaced with a smaller debt.  Please make sure you shop around for rates though.  Last car loan we did was with Bank of America and I couldnt find a CU that could complete with what they offered at the time.
r458xm,r458xm,Hardship withdrawal from 401k (principle financial),JimmyBones79,11/28/2021,2.0,Hello. I am currently trying to close on a primary residence and during negotiations we could not get the seller to cover closing costs. The loan also required that I handle a couple issues out of pocket before appraisal would be signed off on.   I requested a hardship withdrawal from principal financial and meet all the qualifications to merit a payout to cover closing and the repairs. I sent it in over a week ago and it still says processing.   When I first submitted the request it listed documents that may be required by Principal to process the request. I called them and the guy told me that I simply needed to have the documents on hand if requested by other companies etc. I waited a couple days and still no movement on status updates. I called again and a lady told me the same thing.   The process said it would take 7 days to process and an additional 2 to be deposited into my checking account. The request is still sitting idle. I didnt submit documents because I was instructed not to. We have to close in a couple days and still do not have withdrawal.   Is it customary to not have to submit documents? Has anyone else used Principal Financial to withdraw and did you have to submit documents?   Never tried to withdraw from a 401k so Im confused and more concerned that they fed me a line because I know theyd rather not do a pay out if possible.
r458xm,hmet4j4,Hardship withdrawal from 401k (principle financial),rooster7869,11/28/2021,5.0,I will be the one to say it this is a bad idea.  You should not buy a home that requires you to use every penny you can get your hands on. What happens if you lose your job next month? What happens if the house floods or needs other emergency repairs?   You should only buy a house if you can maintain an emergency fund which lets you financially survive hardship while meeting your financial obligations under the mortgage
r458xm,hmf1ngt,Hardship withdrawal from 401k (principle financial),allaboutcheetos,11/28/2021,1.0,I did this but it was with prudential.  It was one simple form but I worked it thru my hr department took very little time.
r458xm,hmfcpop,Hardship withdrawal from 401k (principle financial),send_me_your_deck,11/28/2021,1.0,You did it directly rather than through your plan administrator (your job). It’s most likely going to take the full amount of time because your just a dude whereas your employer is their client.   They say 7 days which means business days. Don’t include Friday as a business day though for principal it probably was. How many business days ago did you submit your request?   On Monday you could call and get a status update and push to expedite. You could also try to expedite through your HR / benefits department. However at this point they might not want to because it’s probably almost done. I suggest asking HR nicely if you don’t get what you want when you call principal.
r458xm,hmeisve,Hardship withdrawal from 401k (principle financial),LesterTheOne,11/28/2021,2.0,When I bought my house I tried to do 401k loan for buying a house. It just sat there for a week or two no change. I’m going off memory from 6 years ago but it ended up being the status wouldn’t change until I had the closing paperwork or something like that. I couldn’t get the moment until the deal was done basically.  I ended up canceling my 401k home loan(whatever called) and just getting a general purpose loan from them. Had it in 3 days.   I just realized you did a hardship.   I did a partial hardship for coronavirus last year and had the money in a few days 3-4.   It generally doesn’t take long to get loans withdraws etc from a 401k in my experience.   I’d keep calling every day. Be a pain in the ass. It’s your money.   This was all probably no real help to you but I would definitely keep calling.
r458z0,hmeilgq,How likely am I to get financed through my same credit Union?,j-christopher,11/28/2021,2.0,Be very careful with credit union car financing.    Most likely your account agreements membership agreement and/or loan agreements have a cross-collateralization clause.  So if you default on a $1000 credit card account and later pay off the car you wont get the title until youve settled the credit card matter.  They can also repossess the car even if you are current on your car payments.

Part of this is politics part of this is the discovery that government debt isnt as bad as we all thought it was.   > as well as my income to be higher.   While youre working sure. But once you retire your only income is what you withdraw from your retirement accounts. With careful planning you get to decide what your income is and what your effective tax rate will be.  Also keep in mind that most peoples expenses are lower in retirement than in their working years. No mortgage payment no car payment kids are through college etc.   Of course there are exceptions. Personally I believe that for most people its good to have a mix of both Traditional and Roth funds so that you can plan accordingly.   > And Roth gives tax-free growth that seems like a lot of taxes to pay on 30 years of growth otherwise no?  Assuming the same tax rate now and in withdrawal its a wash. It only matters if your tax rate is different.
r45f7i,hmek9z4,403(b) Roth vs 529,friedrichpeachy,11/28/2021,1.0,Right. With the current strategy of maxing retirement contributions out when I factor in anticipated child-related expenses this line item will be small/intermittent.

r45i93,r45i93,Pay off car to free up income?,alan_grant93,11/28/2021,1.0,My wife and I bought a nice but moderate used car in August. It was within our budget and we can make the payments (and all our other bills) fine. We have about $200 left over at the end of the month.  However that $600 car payment would be really nice to have back in our monthly budget. We have a few home projects that need done and we have a second kid on the way this summer.  I have about $18k in Apple stock (~$14k after taxes) and we have a $30k emergency fund. We aren’t keen on taking from either - Apple stock has grown almost 5x since I’ve had it and just keeps growing and we just don’t touch our emergency fund.  Because we only have ~$200 left in our budget each month we won’t be able to pay hospital bills for the new kid and save for our next big home project in the next 6 months. However that’s the timeline for both. (Our house is way overdue for painting and we were told during inspection and by some companies that came to give us quotes that if we put it off much longer we risk the wood being exposed and damaged.)  Does it makes sense to cash out the stock and take $20k from our emergency fund to pay off the car? Or keep things as-is and look to cash out stock / take from emergency fund if we find ourselves up against a wall?  (There’s also a small chance we get raises in the next six months. Probably won’t solve all our problems but would help for sure.)
r45i93,hmf1a1m,Pay off car to free up income?,alan_grant93,11/28/2021,1.0,Thank you for your kind measured response :)  If the car market wasn’t as it is we might consider a different car. However we sold our 10-year old car for just under half what we paid for the new car. Selling takes us back where we were which means less space and fewer safety features.  Think we’ll keep looking at areas we might cut back and do 50 stock / 50 EF if push comes to shove.   Thanks again for your advice!
r45i93,hmejbqy,Pay off car to free up income?,alan_grant93,11/28/2021,1.0,Just over 2.5%

r45i93,hmf02qr,Pay off car to free up income?,justLouis,11/28/2021,0.0,Congrats!! I would just throw your extra $200 monthly at your car and avoid withdrawing Apple which will continue to grow and outpace inflation and your emergency fund is quite large and loses a lot of its purchasing power to inflation.
r45i93,hmeqv6j,Pay off car to free up income?,alan_grant93,11/28/2021,0.0,It was an intentional decision - we had a fine car but almost ten years old and we wanted something newer with driver assists and better safety ratings. We also tend to keep our cars for a while imagine that will be true here too.  I didn’t mention but we also contribute to our 401k’s. We could temporarily reduce contributions there but we tend to treat our contribution rate same as we do our emergency fund: always goes up doesn’t come down.

r45h4o,r45h4o,Questions regarding contributing to Roth IRA + General investing questions,GenericPanda7,11/28/2021,2.0,I had a quick question regarding contributing to my Roth Ira. Do people usually invest the max of $6000 on one deposit to minimize possible loses (timing market) or is a dollar-cost average approach better by contributing say $500 every so often. I also know that the due date for that is before April 15 2022 so I would do all of this before then. I am currently in a safe position to drop that $6000 (currently expendable money parked in my checking account) but would like min-max and be efficient (22 y/o engineer with $10k in savings parked in a MMSA). Opened an account with Charles Schwab and plan to do a 70% SWTSX and 30% SWISX allocation which would be $4200 and $1800. Is this a decent plan for index funds if I want a hands-off Roth Ira? I also plan to eventually open a brokerage account and start a dividend investing portfolio that will get me some passive income to pay some bills and possible snowball to a growth account later on.  Any answers comments and thoughts would be greatly appreciated about literally anything I have said!
r45f7i,hmewlql,403(b) Roth vs 529,unchinhairs,11/28/2021,3.0,You arent eligible for deducting traditional IRA contributions at your income level. Are you sure you are eligible to make direct Roth IRA contributions? The phase out for that starts at a MAGI of $198k and you arent reducing your MAGI with 403b contributions.  Also why are you doing Roth 403b contributions at your income level? Your tax break for using traditional 403b would be thousands of dollars a year.  To your original question: you have managed to put $30k into a taxable brokerage. It seems like thats an obvious area to stop adding more to and use that to fund your 529s. Along with the tax break from using traditional 403bs you might have enough to put towards a 529 without decreasing your retirement savings rate.  A broad rule of thumb is to have 1 years income in retirement by age 30 2 years by 35. By that metric you are a little behind so I hesitate to recommend you substantially back off retirement savings at this point.

Im counting on those reduced expenses to free up money for fun or for in-home care or assisted living.  I estimate I could need 400-500% to afford full-time in-home care not sure that is in the cards but that is a target.  > Assuming the same tax rate now and in withdrawal its a wash. It only matters if your tax rate is different.  That only seems true if I never empty the account.  But if I succeed in draining the account to a 0 balance at death Ill have to pay those taxes right?
r45f7i,hmf6tw4,403(b) Roth vs 529,OathOfFeanor,11/28/2021,1.0,I am curious to dive into this  My personal logic is that I expect taxes to be higher in the future as well as my income to be higher.

How much was withheld? Usually its just a flat 20% unless you instructed the 401k provider to withhold more. 20% is probably not sufficient withholding depending on how much other income you have. Just dont want you to be surprised if you end up owing more at tax filing time.

r44o8o,hmein2n,Quit my job and cashed out my 401k,oledawgnew,11/28/2021,2.0,I would try to deploy the money as soon as possible starting with the business so as to maximize income right away before other life’s needs and wants creep up.  Before trying to trade the vehicle in I would get a sell estimate first from Carvana or one of the other car buying services they seem to offer more without a hard sales pitch to buy one of theirs as part of the deal.  As for reinvesting the $40-50k a SEP-IRA might be the best place to start. I’m a hardcore fan of Roth IRAs due to the flexibility of being able to withdraw contributions without penalty and you cannot beat the future no tax withdrawals.  Don’t know the status of your business but you probably want to put some aside for emergency funds (separate ones for the business and personal needs if you can afford it).  Good luck!

r4482e,hmedh5p,New Job - Retirement Sanity Check,notveryvery,11/28/2021,3.0,How much interest is on the debt you’re carrying? If it’s not super high it may make sense to get to max retirement savings right away.   You also don’t say anything about other expenses but given the huge increase in salary I’d consider maxing your contributions right away then max an HSA (if your company has) next and invest it.
r4482e,hmedi0m,New Job - Retirement Sanity Check,BouncyEgg,11/28/2021,5.0,Your plan is fine.  Its basically following the PF Wiki Prime Directive Flow Chart.  1% into your company stock is also fine.  At 1% whether or not you do it will have trivial effects on your overall financial state.
r4482e,hmeeb8v,New Job - Retirement Sanity Check,EducationalCarrot192,11/28/2021,2.0,Okay didnt realize that. Good to know thank you!
r4482e,hmedmn5,New Job - Retirement Sanity Check,wanttostayhidden,11/28/2021,9.0,>Then long term if I get the 401(k) up to 8% that would put me at $19040 for that. Putting both at just below the maxes.  8% would not put you even close to the max for 401k. The 6% that your employer contributes does not count toward your limit.
r4482e,r4482e,New Job - Retirement Sanity Check,EducationalCarrot192,11/28/2021,1.0,Hello all. I am starting a new job with give or take double my last jobs salary and just want a quick sanity check on my retirement set up. I am 31 years old and currently have 40k saved in both traditional and roth IRA from my old job.  136k salary with a 6% 401(k) match.  Initially I have set up 6% contributions to my 401k. Wife has a few thousand in debt we would like to pay off plus a couple grand left on our HVAC loan so going to try and semi-aggressively knock that debt out in a few months.   After paying off debt I will start a vanguard (or vanguard like) Roth IRA and do 4% a month getting me just shy of 6k a year into the roth. Putting me at 10% of my salary to retirement plus 6% from my employer match in lets say 6 months time.  Overall that puts us at $16320 a year for the 401(k)  And $5440 a year for the Roth.   So thinking after debt is handled I can just drop $600 in to the Roth some random month (tax return?) to get me to the 6k max. Then long term if I get the 401(k) up to 8% that would put me at $19040 for that. Putting both at just below the maxes.  Thats the general plan. Any thoughts?  Bonus question I can also buy company stock at a discount. I am debating doing 1% as sort of a mini-nest egg type thing. Like oh need some extra cash for our downpayment on our home/upgrade a kitchen/buy solar panels/whatever sell stock kinda deal. This I am kinda of skeptical about because I think my main reason for wanting to do this is I have never directly owned stock so it just seems kinda fun. Which frankly isnt a good reason but it seems better than a CD at the moment or something like that for midterm purchases. Stock has trended up in the long term fairly consistently. Is this a dumb idea or no?  Thanks in advance for any advice or help!
r4482e,hmeg4bi,New Job - Retirement Sanity Check,notveryvery,11/28/2021,3.0,Understand. From a strictly numbers standpoint you should max the other accounts first and definitely pay HVAC loan before 0% debt but I understand the psychological pull there too.

On a ~115k early distribution the federal taxes and penalties should be about $30k if you have zero other income and $40k or $50k wouldnt be surprising if you do have other income. Depending on where you live you may also have to pay state and local taxes as well.

r458xm,hmf1dn9,Hardship withdrawal from 401k (principle financial),bowoodchintz,11/28/2021,3.0,Exactly. If you need to take a loan from your retirement you can’t afford this house and need to save more money.

r4519k,hmeptxz,Any insurance suggestion,Fish-Weekly,11/28/2021,2.0,Yes there are links on the page I linked which will tell you what you can qualify for and how to do so.
r4519k,hmehn8j,Any insurance suggestion,Fish-Weekly,11/28/2021,1.0,If you make below a certain amount you might qualify for Medicaid depending on your state.  More than that you should qualify for an Affordable Care Act plan with a premium subsidy. You can check here:  https://www.healthcare.gov/lower-costs/qualifying-for-lower-costs/
r44o8o,hmejc62,Quit my job and cashed out my 401k,AnonFuckCostco,11/28/2021,1.0,Okay thank you. I’ll speak with my tax person and take her advice on what to put away for the taxes.
r44o8o,hmegn28,Quit my job and cashed out my 401k,HighOnGoofballs,11/28/2021,6.0,If this was recent you absolutely can get that money back
r44o8o,hmeh5ks,Quit my job and cashed out my 401k,AnonFuckCostco,11/28/2021,-3.0,They’ve already sold everything out of that account and I have already received my paper check. How could I recover those penalties?
r44o8o,hmefbny,Quit my job and cashed out my 401k,RyuFancypants,11/28/2021,16.0,I dont know anything about business accounts but if you are planning on investing 40-50k of the 401k anyway why would you cash it out and take the penalty?  Roll it over to a Traditional IRA and ONLY take out what you absolutely need for this new phase of your life. Less penalties less fees less taxes. And you still preserve some of your retirement for the future.
r44o8o,hmeimrt,Quit my job and cashed out my 401k,Fish-Weekly,11/28/2021,3.0,You have 60 days to roll over all or a portion of it to an IRA without paying penalties on that portion. Any amount you’ve already paid would get refunded to you when you file your taxes. If you’ve got a good tax person already ask them to help you.  I know it is tempting to tap that money when there are bills to pay but the more you can keep invested and tex deferred the better you will be later in life.
r44o8o,hmeggxt,Quit my job and cashed out my 401k,DeIzorenToer,11/28/2021,6.0,You should talk to someone about doing a rollover for business start up (ROBS) you could of rolled your whole 401K balance tax and penalty free into a C-Corp you own for your business and then paid yourself from the C-Corp.  Talk to someone here:  https://www.guidantfinancial.com/landing/sem-nb-mobile/?&utm_campaign=G-Search-Retirement---ROBS-Exact-match-(mobile)&_bk=robs&_bt=405955592594&_bm=e&_bn=g&_bg=56350777615campaignid=1439961305&adgroupid=56350777615&creative=405955592594&matchtype=e&network=g&device=m&keyword=robs&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7oyNBhDiARIsADtGRZZpuIS6FJ0w0-AUeSTCDV7gvrBFctp6koP7bN0G-tT58JaSTT6c-2IaAjbCEALw_wcB  As long as its all the same tax year you might be able to still do it and get your money back.
r44o8o,r44o8o,Quit my job and cashed out my 401k,AnonFuckCostco,11/28/2021,0.0,Hey there thanks for taking the time to help. I’ll keep it short and to the point as I’m on mobile and yea.  I rent a house and have a roommate so monthly expenses are roughly $1100 a month Male between 30-40 Two young kids sole and full custody mom is out of picture entirely $1000 credit card with a $400 balance on it. I usually pay it off every month.  2015 Sedan with 12.5k owed still Less than $1000 in collections from past things I haven’t settled yet.  No school debt or medical debt.   With all that said I left my retail job of almost 15 years and decided to cash out my 401k. After federal taxes were withheld as well as my penalty the final check I received was for approximately $91000. I am not sure how to move forward with it now. My questions  I need to buy a new/different vehicle for my business I started up. I need a truck but not a full size. Should I pay my car off then go trade it in or should I see what the dealer wants to give me first for it? Like I said the truck is a mandatory item I need for my business. Just not sure what would benefit me more letting a dealer pay my vehicle off buying it back or myself paying it off.   I currently bank with Chase but do not want to put this money there. Should I focus more on a credit union for better returns in a savings account for the bit I am going to save? I want to turn my chase account into my business account and use a smaller bank for my everyday life.   I have plans to put about 40-50k back into an investment portfolio but I want to be able to control the purchase and sales. Who has the best trading platform for this currently?  Thanks again for any help and advice.
r44o8o,hmeg5gu,Quit my job and cashed out my 401k,AnonFuckCostco,11/28/2021,-12.0,The money and penalties are already paid and hindsight isn’t going to bring back those penalties. I appreciate your time but would prefer only feedback on my questions i asked.
r44o8o,hmejgxa,Quit my job and cashed out my 401k,AnonFuckCostco,11/28/2021,1.0,Thank you for the response!

r45i93,hmekapr,Pay off car to free up income?,snowednboston,11/28/2021,9.0,This is a *want* not a **need**. Emergency funds are for **needs**.  Your house is not going to crumble apart if it’s not painted within the next 12mos. If it does actually crumble then paint wasn’t the cure to begin with.
r45i93,hmej5h9,Pay off car to free up income?,swamp_fox9,11/28/2021,2.0,What interest rate is your loan?
r45i93,hmekobi,Pay off car to free up income?,david_chi,11/28/2021,12.0,Bottom line is you probably bought more car than you should have and it stretched your monthly budget to the near brink.  The real answer is you should sell the car for something half the cost so that your monthly car payment becomes half or less than what it currently is.   Otherwise your options become basically robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Dip into stock and/or efund to pay off the car to free up monthly cash for kid/projects.  Or dip into it to pay for kid/projects expenses because you dont have enough monthly cash flow.   If you arent willing/able to get into a lesser priced car my approach personally in situations like these is 50/50.  Split things half from stock sale half from efund so that neither is drained entirely.
r462wt,hmfbgat,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,MDfoodie,11/28/2021,0.0,If they are questioning $5 Starbucks purchases that’s more indicative of your financial state than general concern over how that might affect an applicant’s ability to make their mortgage payments.
r462wt,hmerqps,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,2.0,Thats exactly what I do I guess I just use the due date as my reference point to pay down before statement since my payments are on autopay.  Before 2021 I has no idea I was using my cc incorrectly I have seen the light and Im never going back
r462wt,hmf7bqk,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,RubyRidgebackmomma,11/28/2021,-1.0,Ok so you apparently know it all. Even more than the mortgage lenders giving the loans. 🙄   https://www.freeandclear.com/community/do-lenders-check-your-credit-before-your-mortgage-closes
r462wt,hmeqds4,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Consensual-Sex,11/28/2021,1.0,Your credit card will only report once a month based on the balance on the last day of your billing cycle. This usually occurs 3-4 days before your bill comes out. If you wait until the bill is out it’s too late to fix your credit utilization for that month. You want to bring it down to 3% before the final day of your billing cycle. Any payments made towards it may also take a few business days to post.   If your bill usually comes out on the 15th you should make all your payments towards it by the 5th to be sure you don’t miss the cut off.
r462wt,hmeoswi,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Motobugs,11/28/2021,3.0,What new report? OP is just using the CC as usual. CC company will report it as usual nothing unusual!
r462wt,hmfbmv5,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,RubyRidgebackmomma,11/28/2021,0.0,I agree and I wasn’t suggesting that. I was simply saying anytime you swipe the CC during an open mortgage application/loan process they get notified and check into it.
r462wt,hmeppxm,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,1.0,No I pay down after due date but before statement
r462wt,hmfb5qi,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,j-christopher,11/28/2021,3.0,Generally a mortgage company will pull a report just before closing (or just before funding) to ensure there are no huge surprises since the application was taken.  This is a matter of procedure and isnt triggered because you paid for your Bloomin Onion at Steakback Outhouse with your Capital One card instead of cash.
r462wt,hmfi794,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Ritchie_not_Richie,11/28/2021,1.0,Utilization makes up 30% of your credit score. It’s the second biggest factor.   Keeping your utilization under 30% is considered good. Keeping it under 10% is better.   But paying off all of your balance before the statement closing date isn’t good either because if you have 0% utilization reported over and over again the banks aren’t going to want to give you new credit because it looks like you’re not using what you already have.
r462wt,r462wt,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,0.0,Hello all! Im closing on my house on 12/2 and want to take advantage of black Friday deals.  I currently exclusively use my credit card for 90% of all my purchases and then pay it down to 3% utilization after due date and always pay in full. I want to make small $200-300 purchases but not sure if it will be an issue with closing near. I figured it wont be since Im not opening a new Cc or having my credit pulled  Edit: I pay my statement in full and then pay remaining down to 3%
r462wt,hmeqbds,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,RubyRidgebackmomma,11/28/2021,-3.0,New credit reports are pulled when buying a house especially during the closing period when any credit cards are used. Not incorrect fact.
r462wt,hmeqnbz,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,1.0,Yes no problem sorry if its confusing!  Ill pay my statement balance in full from previous month. For the new statement because I pay 90% of my purchases using my cc I will have a high utilization so I pay it down after due date and right before statement period ends  Example: 23rd -Pay off $300 from October statement  6th- Total balance of $1000 pay down to $300 7th (statement period end) -$300 reported
r462wt,hmer44p,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,2.0,Yes this is correct. I did not clarify well
r462wt,hmepxe5,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,0.0,Since I pay my card in full and they will be pulling before anything posts I dont see any concerns.
r462wt,hmepned,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,1.0,I figured as much
r462wt,hmeryid,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,2.0,Thanks so much!
r462wt,hmeq7uv,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Motobugs,11/28/2021,2.0,Just dont be over the limit and no late payments. I honestly dont know what those guys talking about.
r462wt,hmeq1bm,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Ritchie_not_Richie,11/28/2021,4.0,I feel like I’m missing something here. If you pay after the due date you’re making a late payment. And the statement date is typically 23 - 28 days-ish before the due date.   Can you elaborate on your strategy for me so I can understand what you’re doing?
r462wt,hmeqaws,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Ritchie_not_Richie,11/28/2021,2.0,That’s what I was thinking but they clarified and confirmed they pay after the due date. 🤷‍♂️
r462wt,hmenl88,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,RubyRidgebackmomma,11/28/2021,-6.0,Any credit cards used between when you applied and finally close will trigger a new report to be pulled and very well could affect your current closing. Be careful.
r46i50,hmeqdw6,Need some help putting a down payment on a car,alan_grant93,11/28/2021,3.0,Young no credit and sounds like not much money. I remember those days. They sucked and it was hard to find companies who’d work with me.  Do you have money for a downpayment? If so how much?   Could you instead pay cash for a $2-$3k car and save $200-$300 per month for your next car? In two years you’d have ~$5000 cash plus a $2k car. A $7k car would be a big upgrade. You can do that two years later and get a $10-12k car. That’d probably be a great car until you get into your late 20s or early 30s.  Two other pieces of advice: don’t get too caught up in what you drive. If it’s cheap to maintain good on gas cheap to insure - that’s what you want. Also the longer you can keep your car the better. It’s great not having payments! (We recently bought a different car and man payments suck.)
r46i50,hmeqo9f,Need some help putting a down payment on a car,Zahhhreemo,11/28/2021,1.0,Sturdiest comment on here OG 🤞🏿 & yeah like 1500 for now. I’m climbing
r467av,hmeqjcm,Tax question: get married to file jointly or wait and file individually,Its-a-write-off,11/28/2021,2.0,Then federally it doesnt save you much nor cost you if you file married for taxes. There is a slight savings of maybe 500.00 federally. On your state level though it may increase your taxes to be married.
r467av,r467av,Tax question: get married to file jointly or wait and file individually,jdiene01,11/28/2021,2.0,Hi everyone my fiance and I are having our wedding in early 2022 but are considering getting legally married before the end of 2021 if it would be a tax advantage. We have a slightly complicated tax situation (details below) so any advice would be greatly appreciated.  My income/expenses:  - 65K standard wages with federal withholdings  - 85K 1099 work having paid 35K in estimated taxes  - 4K in medical expenses  - maximum IRA contribution  Her income/expenses:  - 75K in 1099 work having paid 15K in estimated taxes  - 18K in business expenses  - 25K in royalty income (taxes paid individually not by the trust)  Thanks for taking the time to read we appreciate the help.
r467av,hmeo375,Tax question: get married to file jointly or wait and file individually,jdiene01,11/28/2021,1.0,My loans are paid off her loan payments are paused but we made a large payment on them this year that wiped off about $3k in interest. I track personal deductions but they have never exceeded the standard deduction.
r467av,hmenft7,Tax question: get married to file jointly or wait and file individually,Waldemar-Firehammer,11/28/2021,1.0,Generally speaking you get a better tax rate by filing jointly. A fiduciary should be able to better telly you what to do for your specific situation.
r467av,hmenjg2,Tax question: get married to file jointly or wait and file individually,Werewolfdad,11/28/2021,6.0,Your incomes are close enough that it likely does not matter unless one of you can itemize
r467av,hmenfap,Tax question: get married to file jointly or wait and file individually,Its-a-write-off,11/28/2021,3.0,Are either of you paying student interest? Do either or you currently itemize personal deductions? Thats different then business expense deductions.
r462wt,hmeq6h6,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,HonestParadox,11/28/2021,2.0,I think OP means pay in full and then pay the remaining down to 3%.

r462wt,hmf7jw3,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,RubyRidgebackmomma,11/28/2021,-1.0,How about providing some type of proof of your statement instead of just saying I’m wrong? I’ve provided a link stating what I’ve said is correct. Your turn. Prove me wrong!
r462wt,hmepit1,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Maleficent_Impact730,11/28/2021,1.0,This makes sense thanks!
r462wt,hmfachl,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,MDfoodie,11/28/2021,1.0,How about I use the same resource that you linked?  > With a second credit check lenders are focused on applicants whose credit profiles have changed *significantly* such as if you take out a new car loan apply for multiple new loans or run up credit card *debt* by making major purchases. This is why we highly recommend that you not apply for new loans or incur significant new debt until after your mortgages closes.   OP’s debt isn’t changing significantly. What OP has been recommended to do is make purchases and then simply pay off the card prior to the debt being reflected on their statements.  > It is also important to continue paying your debts and bills on time.  Not doing this would be the primary thing that hinders OP’s mortgage application. Other commenter’s have warned OP about this.  You commented…  > Any credit cards used between when you applied and finally close will trigger a new report to be pulled and very well could affect your current closing.  This implies that simply using a credit card triggers a new report. This is incorrect. Maybe the lender chooses to randomly pull soft credit checks but that would only hurt OP if all the listed conditions in u/j-christopher comment are in effect. Unlikely.  Using a credit card isn’t going to hurt OP. Are you recommending that anyone with an outstanding mortgage application transitions to only cash/check for purchases during this time frame? Unnecessary.  Here is a good resource: https://thepointsguy.com/2015/04/credit-card-strategies-for-mortgage-and-home-loan-applicants/  > Knowing this you can choose to pay balances in full before your statements close. That way card issuers will report $0 balances and your borrowing ability will not be impaired by the appearance of debt.
r462wt,hmfc4zi,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,MDfoodie,11/28/2021,1.0,Credit score isn’t everything. I could add my dog as an authorized user on my credit card and he could have a 820.
r462wt,hmerup6,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Ritchie_not_Richie,11/28/2021,2.0,Keep up the good work! 😊
r462wt,hmfbsrd,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,RubyRidgebackmomma,11/28/2021,0.0,Wrong! Credit score was 820! 😂
r462wt,hmfai5b,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,ahj3939,11/28/2021,1.0,Once you close on the house you should just ask everyone for a credit limit increase.
r462wt,hmepacb,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,MDfoodie,11/28/2021,2.0,Incorrect.
r462wt,hmfhijr,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,diatho,11/28/2021,1.0,Why not just pay off 100% each month via autopay?
r462wt,hmeoq7l,Using my existing credit card to make black Friday purchases,Pretty_Swordfish,11/28/2021,6.0,Just pay as soon as it hits the card. And make sure that cash isnt also tapped for the house costs.
r45ktz,hmf3esd,What’s the scam here?,MarcableFluke,11/28/2021,1.0,Doesnt sound like a scam at least against you. Your email address isnt private information and anyone case use it when signing up for or buying stuff. If someone was trying to scam you why use your email? Why not use their own so you dont get notified of stuff through email?
r45ktz,hmel6n8,What’s the scam here?,Frozenlazer,11/28/2021,2.0,This was going to be my guess to. The actual scam comes later when they get your card info to refund the purchase.
r45ktz,hmengyu,What’s the scam here?,nogain-allpain,11/28/2021,4.0,My guess if it was an actual Nike purchase is that your email address was randomly used in order to cover the tracks of a fraudster. They used a mailing address that isnt traceable to them (maybe a neighbor?) and picked a random but real email address (yours) from all of the public lists of email addresses out there. When the gift cards get mailed to that address they go pick it up and walk away without a trace.
r45ktz,hmell85,What’s the scam here?,RobertTheBloke1,11/28/2021,1.0,Verified as legit from Nike. I was able to login and track the order using the order number. Legit on their website.
r45ktz,hmeks59,What’s the scam here?,LilacStreetCapital,11/28/2021,6.0,Were the emails actually from Nike? Perhaps the scam is to have you panic click on the “customer service” link in the email which directs you to a fake website which will then “verify” your “order” after you put in your personal information?
r45ktz,hmeu4rq,What’s the scam here?,Anonymoose2021,11/28/2021,4.0,You probably underestimate the likelihood that someone has the same exact name or has a gmail address that is similar but with an extra initial on the middle or something similar.  I had an incident where someone opened an Amazon account assuming that they could later start a gmail account nickname.middleinitial.lastname.    Unfortunately I was already using that gmail address.  So I got notification from Amazon about a tablet being delivered in 2 days.  I used password reset to claim the Amazon account and found a credit card the order info and shipping and billing addresses.  Googled the address and found that it was a restaurant whose owner has a name similar to mine.  I called and he explained what happened.    I assured him that I would delete his credit card info (and there was a rather long pause as he realized I could have ordered stuff using his credit card).     We had a good laugh about strange situation.  Edit to add:  see if there is a Nike account linked to your email.  If there is do a password reset to get into it and you should find contact info for the purchaser.
r45ktz,hmewa6p,What’s the scam here?,DeluxeXL,11/28/2021,1.0,Did you already tell Nike everything you told us here?  Also make sure your Google has two factor using TOTP (authenticator) not the SMS kind.
r45ktz,hmex5z6,What’s the scam here?,redditridic,11/28/2021,1.0,Same thing happened to me with home depot. They use legit email addresses with fake credit cards. They might have even shipped to your home address and then change the shipping address immediately as it ships. I called home depot and told them its fraud and took me 3 tries for them to take it seriously. Pretty stupid.
r45ktz,hmff0f1,What’s the scam here?,RealMccoy13x,11/28/2021,1.0,The scam is the Nike account itself. The criminals gained access to your Nike account which is likely trusted since it was not newly created and also has purchases. A criminal can then add stolen cards to it and fool the risk/fraud scoring by using the existing account. This same scheme exists commonly on Walmart.com which you can find on PF. Other retailers obviously exists as well. I would caution you that almost exclusively these crimes are executed due to poor password hygiene and it possible that other uses of that password could be in jeopardy with other sites. In addition if a criminal can gain access to the email they will so they can bypass 2FA. Change all passwords.
r45ktz,hmelb2t,What’s the scam here?,RobertTheBloke1,11/28/2021,1.0,Legit from Nike. I was able to login with the Order Number and my email address and see the order. I’ll add that to the post!
r45ktz,hmevg4r,What’s the scam here?,RobertTheBloke1,11/28/2021,1.0,What can I do? Obviously comply and help should it ever come back to me - but is there anything proactive I can do?
r45ktz,hmelb8i,What’s the scam here?,AceyAceyAcey,11/28/2021,-1.0,It’s probably not really Nike.   Check out r/scams for more info.
r45ktz,r45ktz,What’s the scam here?,RobertTheBloke1,11/28/2021,3.0,I woke up this morning to 5 different emails from Nike all confirming gift card purchases totaling around $1200.  I panicked checked all my cards and was relieved that none of my cards were used to make the purchase.  However my email address was used to make these purchases. My email address is FirstName.LastName@gmail.com however I have an extremely unique last name - this isn’t just someone fat fingering their email address.   A different card that isn’t mine was used and the gift card was sent to someone I’ve never heard of. They included their email name and a phone number on the email as the recipient of the gift card.  So what’s the scam here? My card wasn’t used but my email was. Is this fraud and their using my email to try and pin the blame on me if they’re ever caught?  Edit: this was a legit email from Nike with a legit order confirmation number(s) I was able to login into the Nike website with the Order Number and my email address and track the order. It also showed the recipients information there.  Edit #2: Contacted Nike customer service they said that my email address was used but kept telling me it was likely a typo - my email is way too unique for a typo. So confirmed that it was legitimately used on the order… but I don’t know why.

r45i93,hmez9k8,Pay off car to free up income?,alan_grant93,11/28/2021,2.0,I just meant it was within our budget at the time we purchased. It wasn’t a poor financial decision at the time.  We also had to start childcare for our kid and despite doing a bunch of research across babysitters daycares in-home nannies and having what felt like a solid baseline it still is somehow more expensive than planned.  We don’t live a crazy lifestyle. Mortgage is 27% of take-home living expenses right at 30% (everything from toilet paper clothes hair cuts quarterly pest control food cellphone dog food and care.) Childcare alone is 14% of our budget - formula food diapers are another 3%. We have no debt aside from the mortgage and car. We only have one car (both WFH two cars doesn’t make sense.)

How it works is a thief uses your identity to order stuff using stolen credit card and an unrelated recipient address. The stolen credit card transactions are traced back to an account in your name/contact info giving the thief more time to cash out. The gift recipient e-mail belongs to yet another victim but this time the thief has hacked into it. Phone number is a burner.   Make sure your Google account has 2 factor using TOTP and recovery codes not SMS (not even for recovery).

So you do exactly what you’re supposed to do but for some reason your original comment reads backwards to me.   What I always tell my clients is put all your spend on your card. Pay it down to 10% before the statement closing date. Then set it to autopay that 10% on the due date.   When your comment was putting the due date before the following closing date I was trying to figure out if you were mixing up the terms or something.   Thanks for clarifying because I was honestly worried you were messing up your credit there for a minute lol.

r45m2h,hmequw3,Personal loan for 30K with good credit,CostofRepairs,11/28/2021,1.0,Maybe a tad high for an unsecured loan with your credit but not blackmail high.   Also the first few answers below are good but do look out for the early/pre-pay “gotchas”. A legit bank/CU likely won’t have them but shady and “sub-prime” places could.  Even a bank/CU might expect three to six months of repayments. Ask and read before you sign.

r45m2h,hmekvrx,Personal loan for 30K with good credit,Frozenlazer,11/28/2021,3.0,Interest is.charged as you go  based on the amount you currently still owe.  So short answer the sooner you pay off the less interest you pay.  Heres how monthly interest charge is calculated. Amt owed x interest rate / 12.  So if you owe 25000 at 5% interest for that month is 25000 x .05 / 12 = 104.17.   If the next month you make a payment of 5104.17 and reduce the balance to 20000 then the next interest charge is 83.33  And that just goes on month after month until you take the balance to 0
r45m2h,hmekqu1,Personal loan for 30K with good credit,Answerstaxquestions,11/28/2021,3.0,Interest will be calculated every day (I.e. 1/365 of your annual rate) and you’ll pay it every month.  So hypothetically if you paid off the loan after one month you’d pay one months interest.
r45m2h,hmekq3e,Personal loan for 30K with good credit,CostofRepairs,11/28/2021,3.0,Depends on the s term of the loan. With 800+ credit a two-year term should be doable.  Might ask for some of that 15k in a CD as collateral.   Uncollateralized personal loan will have higher interest though.  Early pay penalty depends on terms of loan. At a reputable institution though likely no penalty as you’ll pay fees up front of at pay off.  Might need three months to avoid penalty though.
r45m2h,r45m2h,Personal loan for 30K with good credit,Letchwors,11/28/2021,2.0,Hey guys  Some expenses came up and I need to give my dad $30K. I only have around $15 in my savings but I don’t want to touch it and I’d rather get the whole $30k as a personal loan. My credit is good (808 Equifax and 800 Transunion) I can pay back around $2k each month (I want to be done with the loan ASAP).  Currently I do not have any other loans and I can save around $3500 each month after expenses.  So my question is if I pay off the loan early am I still paying the whole interest?

She has a lot of debt.  This seems like an important detail to me. You are in a position where you could just move out pay a fraction of the rent and save a lot of money. I personally dont think throwing her under the bus that would be the ethical move.   If it were me I would probably try to negotiate a fair rent and then gift her like $1000 a month on top of that in a separate transaction. Maybe Id end up paying the same but it would help me feel better about the situation. (Less like Im being cheated and more like Im repaying kindness with kindness.) At a minimum Id try to pay back everything she paid for college plus a healthy interest. But I wouldnt tell her thats what I was doing.   Id also try to help my mom learn to manage money better. Educate yourself first then start helping her. It sounds like she needs it.

You wont have to pay the large tax bill and penalty like you would with a 401k withdrawal. The downside of both a loan and a withdrawal is youre taking 5k out that otherwise would have been growing for the next 30 years so in future dollars this is tens of thousands.

Details are extremely important.   1. Credit card month does not line up with calendar month. Each credit card account has its own billing cycle. It could go from 13th to 12th or something else.  2. In the above example a new bill is issued right after the 12th (statement date) and you are expected to pay by the 9th (due date).   **Pay the entire billed amount in full by the due date.**  If you use your credit card regularly you almost always have leftover unbilled balance on the account. This is not the same as not paying the bill in full. They are two separate actions.

It is *their* responsibility to take care of *you* until you are of age and to make you into a person that can go out in the world and take care of yourself. If they do not do that they have failed as a parent. If you do not take care of your parents once you are grown with a full time job you are doing *exactly* what a young adult child is supposed to do. You have zero obligation to give them any of your income or your time especially when youre just starting out in life (i.e. the absolute worst time to give up your money and your time for anything that doesnt move you closer to self-sufficiency).  If your mother is rewiring your brain by guilting you to think your object in life should be to give back to her as youre currently doing in the form of >**100% of your income** shes emotionally manipulating you to pay for her and your fathers mistakes in life. You know what her proper role is here? To protect **you** from **paying for her and your fathers mistakes** so that **you** can have a normal healthy life as a young adult.  Im really sorry this has been happening to you but youve got to start realizing this is deeply unhealthy behavior your mother is exhibiting. She has no right to lay claim to your income. She has no right to force you to stay at home and live with her mired in the negative results of her and your fathers choices. Furthermore its terrible that she is dismissing your very real and very justified concerns about how this is affecting your life. On her end she needs to get with a lawyer asap and start collecting on your father instead of placing the burden entirely on you for the fact that she financially cannot and your father will not voluntarily take care of the people they both made together.  Finally please get with a family counselor as soon as you can to work through the specifics on this issue and then to also have someone to lean on for emotional support as you go through the practical steps of breaking away from this deeply unhealthy situation.
r49tvl,hmfe1r1,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",RedditShitCommenter,11/28/2021,1.0,Your mom is being unreasonable maybe $2k since she needs help too.  Have you personally asked your dad for help? With a high income cant imagine your dad being a deadbeat but of course theres lots of high earning shitty dads.
r49t8j,hmfl04r,Opting not to use HSA to cover medical expenses.,SC487,11/28/2021,1.0,So tax free mo eh that you can then invest to make the HSA larger with more tax-free money and just let it stockpile?
r49t8j,hmf9l65,Opting not to use HSA to cover medical expenses.,BouncyEgg,11/28/2021,3.0,> let the HSA funds continue to grow tax-free?  This.  If you can afford to pay out of pocket AND invest the HSA funds keeping the HSA will be more efficient.
r49t8j,hmfcdt5,Opting not to use HSA to cover medical expenses.,jinglebells23,11/28/2021,1.0,Thanks! That’s what I figured. I’m used to keeping detailed receipts for 529 reimbursements so I will set up another spreadsheet for this.
r49t8j,hmf9oxl,Opting not to use HSA to cover medical expenses.,Cizox,11/28/2021,1.0,Yeah what most people do is just pay out of pocket as to continue letting the money grow tax free
r49t8j,hmfi6jo,Opting not to use HSA to cover medical expenses.,ShaneCurcuru,11/28/2021,1.0,TIL that you can submit for reimbursement from your HSA (i.e. withdrawing money to pay for a Qualified Medical Expense) even for past expenses (as long as they were incurred after the HSA was created).  Wow HSAs are awesome.  Official details from the IRS: https://www.irs.gov/publications/p969

r49owl,r49owl,How many credit cards should I apply for at once?,Ionnlyhavehalfabtc,11/28/2021,2.0,I understand that  each credit card application comes with a hard inquiry and that can lower your credit score.  I want to apply for more credit cards so I can get better rewards and increase my available credit.  &#x200B  **Heres some information that might be relevant answering the question:**  My current credit score is 790.  Total accounts: 3. 1 installment loan and 2 revolving credit although one of those accounts are closed.  Length of credit history is 3 years.  My credit utilization always is around 1%-9%.  0 missed payments.  Inquiries in the last 12 months are 0 but over 12 months ago I did apply for another credit card but I was dumb enough to put 12k for the income because I was a part time student. This time Im going to put 50k.  For the house payment Im going to put 1000.  Just yesterday I was approved for the blockfi credit card and I expect their hard inquiry to show up soon. Im waiting on the card to come in the mail.  As of right now I only have one card and its the discover it. I want to explore more opportunities out there. My first credit card was an amex card that was connected with my parents account but the account was closed. I shouldve kept it open I know but back then I didnt know any better.  **Questions:**  I am now over 21. Can I include my moms income for the household income? It would be 150k. Would they requests extra forms to verify the 150? because if I have to jump through those extra hoops Id rather just put 50k.  How many credit cards can I apply for at once given that I just applied for the blockfi card yesterday and got approved?  How long should I wait in between applications?
r49t8j,r49t8j,Opting not to use HSA to cover medical expenses.,jinglebells23,11/28/2021,4.0,Hi everyone long time lurker here. I’m curious what you all think about HSAs. I currently am maxing out my HSA and have finally encountered some health expenses that do not fall into the category of preventative care. Nothing crazy expensive (just physical therapy appointments). I have HSA funds that could cover this but would it make more sense to use cash savings to pay and let the HSA funds continue to grow tax-free?

r49owl,hmf99uh,How many credit cards should I apply for at once?,ahj3939,11/28/2021,1.0,I would go for 1 more right now. Inquires barely matter its the new account or rather age of youngest account that impacts your score more. Thing is theres not much difference between 1 new account or 3 new accounts in that regard.
r49ov2,hmf9r04,Consequences of breaking an apartment lease in TX?,t-poke,11/28/2021,1.0,If you follow the contract and meet all requirements for breaking the lease there are no legal or credit score consequences.  If you just pack up your shit and leave they’ll likely sue you and ruin your credit.
r49ov2,hmf9b8d,Consequences of breaking an apartment lease in TX?,Firm_Bit,11/28/2021,1.0,Thanks. Yeah we definitely wont just skip town. It seems like working with them to get a new tenant lined up might be an option under TX law. Appreciate the advice.
r49ov2,r49ov2,Consequences of breaking an apartment lease in TX?,Firm_Bit,11/28/2021,1.0,EDIT: Definitely want to do this as legally appropriate as possible. By breaking a lease I mean coming to a new arrangement. Wont simply stop paying and skip town. But this has got to be a common situation so Im wondering how people go about it.   Will be speaking with the apartment staff but I wanted to be somewhat knowledgable about the topic beforehand.   Signed a 15 month lease at a pretty basic mass produced apartment complex. There are job opportunities in other cities that wed like to pursue and so might need to leave Texas.  Wondering what the consequences are for a broken lease. Reading through the contract it says that remaining rent is due which seems excessive haha. We couldnt swing paying 10+ months of this rent on top of rent for a new apartment.   So Im wondering if anyone has insight on this situation. Perhaps this is typical contract language but getting off with a fee is common? Thanks for any advice.
r49ov2,hmf90f4,Consequences of breaking an apartment lease in TX?,Default87,11/28/2021,3.0,You are bound by the lease contract you signed. If you don’t pay your apartment will take you to court and win easily.   I would look to see what your lease says about subletting the apartment out.
r49ov2,hmf9lmk,Consequences of breaking an apartment lease in TX?,Firm_Bit,11/28/2021,3.0,No doubt. And we wouldnt not pay. But were looking for ways to mitigate the fall out. Seems like we might only be liable for the rent during vacancy while the landlord makes an attempt to re-rent. Thats pretty open ended though so well keep reading. Thanks!
r49ov2,hmf8wv2,Consequences of breaking an apartment lease in TX?,Looking_Down,11/28/2021,1.0,You can sublet to someone as an option. Essentially they take over your lease for you. Either way you should contact your landlord and ask them what your options are. I would not advise just leaving. They will send you to collections and that will create a huge mess for you sooner or later. Be up front. Ask the questions. Explain your situation and plans.
r49owl,hmfaqmx,How many credit cards should I apply for at once?,Cizox,11/28/2021,3.0,This really depends on what your goal for getting multiple credit cards is for. You mentioned “better rewards” so I will point you over to r/churning where you may learn a little more about credit card strategies to maximize rewards.   I will say as general advice certain banks have limits as to whether you can apply for a credit card based on how many credit cards you’ve opened recently either with them or another bank. As an example Chase will not approve you under any circumstances if you’ve opened 5 personal credit cards in the past 24 months. You can head over to the subreddit I linked above to learn about the other limits. But from a r/personalfinance perspective the thing to watch out for is for the hard inquiries and the average age of account if you apply for too much which depends on how low you’re willing to have your credit score fall.
r49t8j,hmfjg0w,Opting not to use HSA to cover medical expenses.,SC487,11/28/2021,1.0,Wait HSA funds grow if they aren’t used?
r49t8j,hmf9k27,Opting not to use HSA to cover medical expenses.,pancak3d,11/28/2021,6.0,>I have HSA funds that could cover this but would it make more sense to    use cash savings to pay and let the HSA funds continue to grow tax-free?  Yes this is objectively the optimal way to use the HSA -- dont use it keep the receipts reimburse yourself down the line. I number every receipt log the date/amount/vendor/receipt# in a spreadsheet and scan a copy -- for everything from $400 doctor bill to $10 for Tums at CVS.  No one would fault you for just using the HSA of course because thats what its for but paying out of cash and reimbursing yourself in 20 years is a great hack.
r49t8j,hmfkobi,Opting not to use HSA to cover medical expenses.,jinglebells23,11/28/2021,1.0,If you invest them yes. I usually keep a years worth cash just in case otherwise drop into an index fund.
r49tvl,hmfa96e,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",emsadsm,11/28/2021,3.0,I’m not sure where you are located but I could imagine that you would be able to find an apartment by yourself or with roommates for a fraction of the cost your mom is asking for.   My only thought is that you need to move out ASAP.
r49tvl,hmfai8y,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",FocusedFelix,11/28/2021,7.0,Yep. With 3k you could have a two bedroom apartment in a major city and still have room to breathe.
r49tvl,hmffv0k,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",sad_ghostly_potato,11/28/2021,1.0,Thanks for all your thoughts u/itsworththewhile. This gave me a needed dose of perspective. Glad and sad Im not alone in this.      Just to clarify a couple points - the $4000 i make every month is after taxes and 401K deduction. My parents are divorced and my dad is required to pay alimony but he doesnt. My mom has gone after my dad with a lawyer multiple times to no avail - I dont know how the system works but its not working for us. Yeah Im paying for that arent I. I dont know how I didnt see that.
r49tvl,hmfhh33,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",sad_ghostly_potato,11/28/2021,1.0,Nope havent asked him yet but maybe I should give it a try. I havent spoken to him in \~6 years so itll definitely feel a bit odd. And yeah hes always been a high earning shitty dad - he was living in luxury without us last time i saw him.
r49tvl,hmfdqk1,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",IamRick_Deckard,11/28/2021,1.0,So OP is paying the rent for a place for her whole family plus their food and utilities as a contribution? Hell no. OP: get your own place. Your mom is bad with money and trying to make you pay her back or something. If you are really independent then be independent.
r49tvl,hmfembg,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",sad_ghostly_potato,11/28/2021,1.0,Yall I wish it was a Chicago penthouse. Its a small 2-bedroom with a closet-sized bathroom in California. This is actually the cheapest place around here for rent because of the school district.
r49tvl,hmfcq0i,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",Ainulindala,11/28/2021,1.0,$2400. OP is paying $600/mo on top of that (presumably for utilities and food?)
r49tvl,hmfbrv1,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",IamRick_Deckard,11/28/2021,1.0,What is the market rate of the apartment you are in?
r49tvl,hmfcdb7,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",ufest57,11/28/2021,3.0,Ill be as subtle as possible...GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE. You are your own person making your own living and educating yourself. Time to live on your own and continue to grow as an individual. This isnt disowning your mother or family simply the next step in life.
r49tvl,hmfec1t,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",Agling,11/28/2021,1.0,You are 22 years old. Its time to be an adult. Your Mom is keeping you in the position of a child and also parasitizing you. This will stunt you personally which is more significant than what it does to you financially.  Move out as soon as possible. When you get your feet under you or whenever you feel the desire you can choose to give your Mom money or help your siblings--that is how an adult helps their parents/siblings. Your Mom sacrificed a lot throughout your life in order for you to become a healthy adult. She can no longer help you you have to take the next step.  Pretty much all mothers sacrifice a lot for their children. And on some level they want whats best for them. Sometimes their shortcomings prevent them from actually *doing* whats best for them though. Luckily you are old enough to see the situation for what it is. I dont think you need to fight with your Mom or be angry at her. Just recognize the limitations of what she can do and what the mature thing for you to do is.  Good luck.
r49tvl,hmfcdfj,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",Cczaphod,11/28/2021,2.0,It sounds like you want to stay and help.  Id recommend apartment hunting gather data and before you make a decision tell her you could live (potentially closer to grad school or job) at apartment X Y or Z for Rent A B and C  (dont forget to add electricity other utilities if theyre not inclusive) and see where those numbers fall compared to what shes asking.   If she continues to be unreasonable and her rates are high for the area youve got your apartment hunting started and your mindset into living separately.
r49tvl,r49tvl,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",sad_ghostly_potato,11/28/2021,1.0,Hey folks! Just want an outside perspective on my financial situation before I dig myself too deep.  I’m 22 just graduated living at home (small apartment) just started working full time (take home \~$4000/month) and go to grad school part-time. My mom wants me to pay rent - which is totally fair - but I feel like shes asking for more than I can afford. When I try to compromise I get laughed at and called selfish and the conversation pretty much ends there. I get similar results when I bring up wanting to move out. My mental health is BAD already and this is stressing me out a lot. Any advice or thoughts would be super appreciated.  **Money details**:  Shes asking for at least $3000 per month going forward (Ive paid her over $25000 in the past 6 months already). The rent for our apartment is \~$2400/month. Im also paying for grad school out of pocket (over $6000 every 3 months) and have \~$25000 left in student loans. Im *also* putting a small percent of my salary into my 401K. I offered my mom $1500/month + taking on all the household chores but was told thats as good as nothing. Im trying to save for my first car want to move out mid-2022 due to family history and living at homes impact on my mental health. Id also love to get a pet eventually and start having an actual life. I have no idea if Im being selfish or being immature for my age or what.  **Mom details**:  Shes a single parent and works full-time she helped me out with college shes putting my younger sibling through college right now and the youngest is in high school. She has a lot of debt. Dad is out of the picture (he has a 200k+ job but doesnt give us a cent). My moms done SO MUCH for me and my siblings and I want to give her all the good things she deserves but Id prefer to do that when I have money and emotional energy to spare.  Any thoughts? I just want a fresh take on all this. I want to help my mom out but also start creating my own life without immense guilt. Thanks for reading all this!  &#x200B  **EDIT**: Thank you for the helpful responses everyone! Ill try to answer any questions yall have. Im going try negotiating with her again and see what happens. Moving out is a last resort but its looking like a better option every day.
r49tvl,hmfh19i,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",sad_ghostly_potato,11/28/2021,1.0,>Is that a typo? That works out to like $4200 a month more than your own take-home pay.  Not a typo. I gave my relocation and sign-on bonus to her earlier this year ($17500). I also didnt contribute to my 401K until this month. $4000 is my take-home starting this month.  >I personally dont think throwing her under the bus that would be the ethical move.  Yup I feel the same. Ill try to negotiate. I dont want to do anything rash but Im genuinely worried if the situation is sustainable
r49tvl,hmfbyvo,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,11/28/2021,3.0,Time for you to move out on your own. It’s better to have your own space than to pay 3k to live at home. I wouldn’t recommend trying to reason with her.

r49t8j,hmfaw6h,Opting not to use HSA to cover medical expenses.,Unoriginal_White_Guy,11/28/2021,6.0,This is amazing advice. As long as youre organized this is the way. There is no time limit on reimbursements from an HSA. I know people that have tens of thousands of dollars in receipts from years ago that can be used as reimbursements whenever they need. I think about it as the worst case back up plan. Do you need cash and there is no other options? Some people will opt to take a loan on their 401(k). The loan will obviously need to be paid back but with holding receipts from years ago you can get reimbursed from your HSA instead in a pinch.
r49tvl,hmfesaa,"Living at home and paying rent, need an outside perspective",InteriorAttack,11/28/2021,1.0,thats not the point.

r4aa7i,hmfd22z,Best ways to build credit?,One-Source5465,11/28/2021,1.0,Credit will be the best way.   Open a secured credit card and use it for fuel and food and pay it off in FULL before the end of every billing period.   A secured card may require a deposit to match the value(50$ for a 200$ credit line) you would get the deposit back if you close the card but keeping it open as long as possible will help your score even more.   After a year you can open a second better card with cash back.   Good luck!
r4aa7i,hmfhlyg,Best ways to build credit?,DeluxeXL,11/28/2021,1.0,A secured credit card has a security deposit. Its like the security deposit when renting - you wont get it back until the account is closed or converted to unsecured status.

Somehow the neighbor’s bumper got hooked into her bumper and she pulled part of the neighbor’s bumper off.   But she was so excited to tell me she did the right thing called insurance nothing to worry about.  Except… the bumper repair was about $1200. Our premium went up by $2800 over three years. And when I thought that was outrageous given our stellar driving records no accidents no tickets no insurance claims I got quotes from other companies. They wanted even MORE!  One mark against you and the insurance companies - all of them - will make you pay.
r4arrg,hmfgrmb,Insurance quotes are crazy!,Dunno_Bout_Dat,11/28/2021,1.0,Tickets usually stay on insurance for 3-4 years from date of payment.     It is not uncommon to see a 20% increase after one ticket so 50% after TWO speeding tickets (indicating a habitual speeder) is kinda exactly what would be expected.

r4auwo,hmfiqd6,Question about my first secured credit card,justLouis,11/28/2021,1.0,That $200 is your total spending limit based on your down-payment on your SECURED credit card which the credit card issurer will use if you decide to default on your payments. You will get your deposit back in 12 months minimum after they determine you are trustworthy borrower. Your card will become unsecured at this time since its not backed by your deposit and you may be eligible for a larger credit limit. You could try to have a larger down-payment for a bigger credit limit if you wanted but no need to.   Edit: You do not need to carry debt month to month and pay interest to build credit. Pay on time and pay in full.

r4bnra,r4bnra,Fidelity Roth IRA Investments,JustMeerkats,11/28/2021,1.0,I am going to open up a Roth IRA for myself as well as one for my husband in January 2022. I have been looking into managing it myself to avoid the advisory fees from Fidelity.  I am 27 husband is 28.  I am looking into doing a 75(domestic)/25(international) split between FSKAX and FTIHX respectively. Then just hold and let grow for the next 40 or so years.   Do I need to look into bonds yet?  When I used the Fidelity planner it recommended 10% in bonds.  However everywhere Ive seen has said to not worry about bonds until the age of 50+.  For those that are currently using Fidelity are these fee free?  Their website claims zero expense ratios for mutual index funds which Im assuming these are?  We are going to drop out 401(k) contributions to 10% of our pre-tax income with the 10% including employer match.
r4bmpn,r4bmpn,"Told to foot plumber fee by housemate, landlord didn't authorise.",Traditional_Thing_48,11/28/2021,1.0,Hey so we have a sink in the bathroom (obviously) and the plug hole is one of the push open ones. Theres no lever to push it back up like on others Ive seen so assumingly it was a push one.   Well I pushed it in and it didnt come back up. Ive tried using fairy liquid to lube + twist it out but its properly stuck.  Anyways I understand its an inconvenience but its an honest mistake. I told my landlord in the first instance when I realised what I had done and he suggested a couple of things to try.  Later that evening the eldest woman housemate whom everyone has a strong dislike for because of her cultural arrogance that she cannot seem to shake waited for me to come out of my room after just waking up from a 12 hour shift and before I could make it across the hallway her door sprung open super quick.  She said: What have you done to fix it? I said:      Ive texted landlord and hes giving me some steps to try. She says: Thats not good enough you cannot wait for him why have you not fixed it everyone is suffering I have called a plumber and you will be paying for it.- then slams said door.  Ive then texted my landlord telling him that he needs to keep her in line and how she should consult me before making executive decisions. Landlord had no idea she took it on herself to get someone in which is not allowed in her AST.  My friend is a plumber and owes me a favour that would have came to sort it for nothing without the need for her to get involved. Landlord said get my plumber friend over.  Today whilst Im sleeping Im woken up by a knock on my door from someone no idea who as I didnt answer it but Im guessing it was either her or her friend who is a plumber.  For information the sink got blocked 3 days ago and I ran the troubleshooting steps yesterday. We have 3 bathrooms in the house so its not like she cant meet basic sanitisation needs.  Am I the arsehole?
r4b2ng,hmfjifo,I want to move out of my parent's house soon,o2msc,11/28/2021,1.0,So your question is whether you should live at home where your expenses are likely very low or get an apartment with your unemployed friends as roommates?   Go to school live home and keep saving money. Move out when you graduate and get a full time job. You’re 17 you have your whole life to be independent.
r4b2ng,hmfi69m,I want to move out of my parent's house soon,KCPilot17,11/28/2021,1.0,So whats your question? If you should?  I mean you *can*. Financially its not smart but I get the independence piece. Where is the other 70% of your income going? Youre going to need to take about 30% of that for living costs at a minimum.
r4b2ng,hmfj5fz,I want to move out of my parent's house soon,Inb4BanAgain,11/28/2021,1.0,It really comes down to how the home life is. Sometimes you just need your own territory and your own rock to pee on regardless of if its the wisest move financially.
r4b2ng,r4b2ng,I want to move out of my parent's house soon,nebula0404,11/28/2021,1.0,I am a 17 year old living in the Chicago metro area. I love my parents but I really want to be independent. I work a job that pays me $15.15 an hour and I have roughly $5.5k saved. I save 30% of my paycheck every time I get payed. I have a couple of different options on my plate right now and I want to make one that is financially wise but also the best for me.   I am planning on attending college in Fall of 2022. I have applied to a few places already. If I go to college in the area I would plan on either living in my own place or living with my parents (assuming living on campus isnt required). If I go to college away from the area I live I would probably just dorm there.   Many of the colleges I am applying to are in the area. I have some money saved for college too. I also have the ability to attend my local community college for free if I want.  I have 2 friends who are unemployed at the moment but 100% willing to roommate with me both are actively looking for jobs. I really would prefer to move out of my parents house by the time Im 20. Would I be able to do this or would it be better to just stay at home? Thanks
r4b2ng,hmfim2b,I want to move out of my parent's house soon,jibstay77,11/28/2021,1.0,Community college for the first 2 years. Work with counselors to make sure everything will transfer to a state 4 year school. Live at home as  long as you can to save money.

r4auwo,hmfh4xi,Question about my first secured credit card,yuiop300,11/28/2021,1.0,That is exactly what it means.  You transfer $200 to them first then you now have $200 to spend as long as you pay what is due at the end of the month.  You’ll have to wait until at least 6months before they increase your limit or change your decided cc to normal one.
r4auwo,hmfhec6,Question about my first secured credit card,alittlemouth,11/28/2021,1.0,It means you can spend $200 total until you make a payment that brings the balance below $200. You may be able to request a credit limit increase after several months of on-time payments.   Rule of thumb for your first card is to make small purchases and pay them off each month. Never accrue interest. Good luck!
r4auwo,hmfiyn1,Question about my first secured credit card,nobody0597,11/28/2021,1.0,Okay that cleared things up thanks!

r4auwo,r4auwo,Question about my first secured credit card,nobody0597,11/28/2021,1.0,So I have no credit history and was just approved a secured credit card with a $200 credit line thats going to be mailed to me soon...Im confused about what the credit line means exactly.

r4an3z,r4an3z,Refinance and escrow question,catzandbabiez,11/28/2021,1.0,Hello hoping someone here can help. I recently did a cash out refinance of our home. We originally had Wells Fargo and used Better.com to refinance and our new lender is Amerihome. Everything seemed to go fine loan was transferred we received our escrow payout from Wells Fargo and our first payment with Amerihome is due this week.  However I just received a bill from a company I had no interaction or information from The Money Source. It is a bill for over $3000. This exact amount is what shows up as our escrow balance in Amerihome. Can anyone explain what this is? Why wouldn’t this escrow amount have been taken out during closing? Why did I receive a payout from WF? Just confused and feel like I missed something major. Thanks.
r4an3z,hmfg2sq,Refinance and escrow question,catzandbabiez,11/28/2021,1.0,I have emails out to all the involved parties. But it’s Sunday and I’m anxious so I’m reaching out to my favorite financial forum.
r4an3z,hmfezf7,Refinance and escrow question,jorge1209,11/28/2021,1.0,Yeah that is weird and it should have been taken care of with closing.  Ask Amerihome what is going on/check your closing sheet. I suppose it is possible you opted not to find escrow at close... But its unusual.  The payout from WF was you prior escrow account and it is normal to get that payout.  -----  The escrow account is your money that is set aside to pay taxes and insurance. Which is why when your old mortgage was paid off the escrow money was sent to you its your money until the tax bill comes.  However there may only be 4 months until your tax bill and so you need to fund the new escrow with 8 months worth of contributions.  Usually they roll this into the principal on a refi. So your principal goes up by an amount equal to the escrow and its technically a cash out refi (the cash coming out is equal to the escrow amount the old mortgage service held).  However if you didnt cash out then you need to cash in and pay extra to find the escrow.  Perhaps yours was a third variant where it was neither cash out not cash in but just an unfunded escrow and you are expected to roll the return of the old escrow funds into the new escrow.
r4an3z,hmffsxc,Refinance and escrow question,Ecstatic_Being8277,11/28/2021,1.0,And when you contacted The Money Source to question their bill they said......?
r4adif,hmfh0m2,Company denying variable pay,AceShrill,11/28/2021,1.0,Did not fully understand you. This variable is my right yes?
r4adif,hmfkeaq,Company denying variable pay,shadow_chance,11/28/2021,1.0,That sounds like a typical bonus. Again I wouldnt expect to see it if youre not employed on the day it pays out.   Employers in the US generally dont owe you anything beyond minimum wage unless you have a specific contract/union agreement/etc.   Your company *should* have provided a written document detailing how and when this piece of comp is paid. If they didnt they likely have wide latitude in determining if departed employees are eligible.
r4adif,r4adif,Company denying variable pay,AceShrill,11/28/2021,1.0,My current company has an evaluation period from Jan-Feb. But for some reasons it pays out the variable and the increments in the month of June.  I am currently serving my notice peiod which will get over by Feb22 end.  The payout rules are not present anywhere and my offer clearly mentions that I have to be part of the organization till end of year for being eligible for bonuses and variable pay.  Company is fairly small and I know for a fact that they can bend rules as per their convenience.  How should I handle this situation? What all points should I put forward to convince them?
r4adif,hmfkswp,Company denying variable pay,KReddit934,11/28/2021,1.0,But you will not be there when the bonus is paid?   I guess you ask if the variable will be paid out when you leave but I would expect them to say No.  Still you can ask.
r4adif,hmfgshk,Company denying variable pay,shadow_chance,11/28/2021,1.0,Is this a discretionary bonus? If so dont expect to receive it if you arent employed on the day of payment.   > How should I handle this situation?  Stay employed or ask your new company for a signing bonus.  > What all points should I put forward to convince them?  They have no obligation to pay a bonus to someone who isnt employed.
r4adif,hmfkaad,Company denying variable pay,AceShrill,11/28/2021,1.0,Ues serving the notice. But I will be employed to current firm till after the performance period.
r4adif,hmfk3hv,Company denying variable pay,KReddit934,11/28/2021,1.0,You said you are serving notice which I read to mean you are leaving the company.
r4adif,hmfgnoa,Company denying variable pay,KReddit934,11/28/2021,1.0,>my offer clearly mentions that I have to be part of the organization till end of year for being eligible for bonuses and variable pay.  That pretty much sums it up.  What are you going to say to them to make you worth giving you money they dont have to. You are leaving...yes?   If so  they have no reason to be nice.
r4adif,hmflpgg,Company denying variable pay,AceShrill,11/28/2021,1.0,Yes!! This is the exact issue. They pay in June. I wont be around at that time. I want to convince them somehow.y performance is extremely good this year and they are ready to match any external offers.
r4adif,hmfi63t,Company denying variable pay,shadow_chance,11/28/2021,1.0,Then I wouldnt expect to get this piece of compensation.
r4adif,hmfj44c,Company denying variable pay,AceShrill,11/28/2021,1.0,I am not sure if you understand the variable component of salary. How it works is that a major part of the salary is given based on performance. And a certain part of this guaranteed since you will have to get a 0 rating to not get anything. Only strict rule is that the employee has to stick around till performance evaluation end. Payout may be delayed though.
r4adif,hmfkc2a,Company denying variable pay,KReddit934,11/28/2021,1.0,What exactly are you trying to convince them to do?

r4aa7i,hmfm445,Best ways to build credit?,AzeTheGreat,11/28/2021,1.0,There’s no need to start with a secured credit card unless they’ve already been denied from a starter card.  It sounds like they have no credit (rather than poor credit) so they should have no problems getting approved for something like the Discover It.
r4aa7i,hmfdjb2,Best ways to build credit?,yogaballcactus,11/28/2021,1.0,If you have student loans then dont miss any payments.   Get a credit card (doesnt need to be secured unless thats all you can get) and pay the statement balance when or before it is due every month. Never carry a balance. You do not want to pay credit card interest rates.   You generally do not want to borrow to build credit. When you borrow money you pay interest. Paying interest is bad. Youll be able to get good credit just from using a credit card and paying it on time every month. You dont need to do anything above and beyond that.
r4aa7i,hmfcu6f,Best ways to build credit?,HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,11/28/2021,4.0,Open a secured card for 200-300 bucks (as collateral) and use it for your Spotify bill every month or something like that

r4alag,hmfhu4x,What types of expenditure categories do y'all track on a monthly basis?,dipshit_banker,11/28/2021,1.0,Controlling my spending and interested in data. Part of it is giving me a quick reference to know how much Ive spent on a certain thing when Im considering a purchase. The other part is being able to identify spending habits to help determine what/when I tend to spend money. Its why I kind of struggle w/ how closely to track certain things.   Clothing for instance. Not super useful for me on a monthly budget because I buy so little clothing but it becomes useful when I want to gauge how much I spend on clothing in a given year.   But Projects. I basically put any work I do on my house into Projects. Do other people find value in blowing that up a bit? Immediately I could cascade it into Emergency Repair vs Optional project or something. Not 100% sure I see that value in that. But thats one hypothetical - Im mostly curious if others have found it especially useful to track other categories across months/years.

r4ag2a,hmfewfd,Will a co-signer benefit the DTI I'd be working with for securing a higher mortgage?,Peachesornot,11/28/2021,1.0,If you cant get approved based on your income and debt you probably cant afford it.
r4ag2a,hmfgzw0,Will a co-signer benefit the DTI I'd be working with for securing a higher mortgage?,Ecstatic_Being8277,11/28/2021,1.0,Depends on your mothers current DTI and the proposed DTI if she has to make each new mortgage payment.  And since this will not be her primary residence that will be factored in!  So the answer to your question is:  Depends on many factors (income current debt not primary residence etc).
r4ag2a,hmfe289,Will a co-signer benefit the DTI I'd be working with for securing a higher mortgage?,daviongray,11/28/2021,1.0,Yes a cosigner will help. Personal loan should definitely be paid off before you take on more debt. A house is more than just a mortgage payment. There are many other small expenses that add up and things do break when you least expect it. Good luck.
r4ag2a,hmfdo77,Will a co-signer benefit the DTI I'd be working with for securing a higher mortgage?,InteriorAttack,11/28/2021,1.0,yes it will help. what is the rate and amount of that personal loan?

Seriously it will change things between you and her forever and that’s before anything bad happens.
r4ag2a,r4ag2a,Will a co-signer benefit the DTI I'd be working with for securing a higher mortgage?,seektankkill,11/28/2021,1.0,I am in a situation where Im beginning the process to buy my first home. I make enough money to comfortably handle a decent sized monthly mortgage payment (up to $2k a month) but I do still have student loans and an outstanding personal loan that I wont be paying off before needing to buy.  I have excellent credit but Im aware with my current loans that my DTI would be considered high by a lender. One avenue Im exploring is having my mother co-sign on the house with me and in the future refinance into my name only. She has excellent credit as well great income and no debt other than her own mortgage.  Would having her co-sign with me provide more room for a higher total mortgage amount? Unfortunately in the area Im in a decent home thats not an absolute dumpster fire starts at $350k to $400k. Its a payment I can easily handle but I know with the DTI consideration that I probably wont be able to get approved for that amount by myself.  Thanks!
r4ag2a,hmfik89,Will a co-signer benefit the DTI I'd be working with for securing a higher mortgage?,DeluxeXL,11/28/2021,1.0,A co-signer does not have ownership. If she has co-ownership she would be called a co-borrower. The relationship concern is still relevant.

r49ov2,hmfl1xr,Consequences of breaking an apartment lease in TX?,shadow_chance,11/28/2021,1.0,Ideally you can find someone on your own to take over/sign a new lease. Often a lease break fee with this.   Otherwise you can break the lease but the landlord must make a good effort to re-rent the unit. They cant sit on their hands and make you pay the 10 months although less scrupulous landlords may try.
r49ov2,hmfa6jx,Consequences of breaking an apartment lease in TX?,RoastyMcGiblets,11/28/2021,4.0,You are technically liable for the entire amount. But if you are in an area where there are few vacancies the landlord will almost immediately re-rent the apartment. Once a new tenant moves in you are off the hook they can not double dip and collect rent from you as well as the new tenant. However theyre not obligated to accept just any applicant they can still screen people. But if there are few vacancies theyd have a hard time explaining why they could not find a suitable tenant for your unit. Also if you move out of the area this can be hard to figure out unless you have friends in the complex who can keep an eye on the unit for you. Trying to deal with a court case over this when out of state is messy and expensive.   Sometimes landlords will allow a lease-break fee equal to 2 months rent. Id suggest offering that to your landlord especially if they think they can get a new tenant in asap. This fee is an exception to the double-dipping I mentioned above as it is a fee not rent.   As far as subletting goes make sure your lease allows it. IME big corporate complexes generally do not.
r49ov2,hmfa0sz,Consequences of breaking an apartment lease in TX?,Firm_Bit,11/28/2021,1.0,Thanks! Yeah reading through the contract to figure things out. Looks like theres some language about it in there but its in legalese. Well keep reading and we appreciate the insight.

She shouldnt simply allow him to steal from her in order to protect him. Thats so backwards.  She can do it nicely though. Look Dad I realize you didnt want me to go on this trip and I went anyway. Im sorry that upset you. But this is my hard-earned money set aside for my future and you stole it from me. I am asking you to return it because you know its the right thing to do. I need that money. If you refuse to return it I will be forced to take legal action which I truly do not want to do. Please do not force me to choose between your future and my own.

r48wc5,hmfd4vs,"My girlfriend's dad stole $12,000 from her",Shadow14l,11/28/2021,1.0,It seems like it’s a joint account. If so then the court can’t really do much because legally it’s both of their monies. Now if the account doesn’t have his name on it then definitely file for the max in small claims.

r48wc5,hmfm27z,"My girlfriend's dad stole $12,000 from her",WillyValentine,11/28/2021,1.0,I would say to him that since you stole from my future then we have no future.

r48ofz,hmf5lk7,I’m about to make more money than I ever have but I’m pretty seriously in debt…how do I begin digging myself out?,davidg4781,11/28/2021,1.0,I’m probably going to be the outlier but you’re asking so I’m giving. This is based off of years studying personal finance being in a lot more debt than you and my aversion to risk. I’ll just answer by numbers so you may need to put them in the correct order. You need to set up a zero-based budget to really know how much you can afford. Moving to a new city can be expensive and you don’t want to get over your head on things.   1. Keep paying the minimums on all of them. I would save up some money in an emergency fund maybe $1000 before aggressively attacking this debt. Once you’re ready attack the smallest debt first with a vengeance then move on to the next. Send everything you can spare to it. Having a paid for car gives you a lot more flexibility and your credit cards have the same balance. For the credit cards pick the one with the highest interest rate to kill first.   2. I can’t remember how deferment works but I would make sure you’re settled in (within weeks) and your job seems stable then contact them. Maybe someone else can chime in on this but I would hate they charge you back interest and penalties for not reporting you got a job sooner. If this is all your debt save this one for the end after paying off car and cards.   3. Get out of debt first. In the grand scheme of things you don’t owe much. Pretend you’re still a broke college kid. Get coupons. Eat cheap meals. You can be completely out of debt in 6-18 months (depending on how much rent is over there). Then you have the rest of your life to build wealth.   4. I wouldn’t get a car now. If yours is still running keep it assuming you’re taking it with you. If not see if you can take public transportation a bike or buy an inexpensive used car. A 10 year old Civic or Corolla. They’re not the sexiest but they won’t let you down and won’t tie up cash. You can always get something else after you’re out of debt. Leasing is the worst thing you can do.   5. If you can bare it I’d stay with them. Maybe even offer some “rent” or food money so the relationship stays good. At least stay until you can get out of debt and save some money up. Count this as a blessing. Debt is the most crippling part of building wealth and rent is one of the biggest part of someone’s budget.   Hopefully all this helps.

This is exactly what I was looking for and it really genuinely will help me out a lot with my planning. You hit every one of the points I’m worried about and the way you explain things make it feel so manageable and less scary.   Thank you so so much.
r48ofz,hmf419f,I’m about to make more money than I ever have but I’m pretty seriously in debt…how do I begin digging myself out?,Particular-Earth-453,11/28/2021,4.0,$80K will go quickly in SoCal honestly.   You should focus on paying off the credit cards first. Throw all extra money at only one card until it’s paid off. Then roll into the second one.   You’re car only has $4600 left and is worth $7K so already sounds like you’re driving something close to a beater given the current market. Just keep making payments. What is the interest rate?   I would keep your living expenses minimal for as long as you can. Once you get the debt paid off (mostly the credit cards unless car rate is really High) then I’d start saving a 3 month emergency fund of what you anticipate your expenses would be if you moved out. Plus save whatever you need for a deposit and initial move in.  Make a very detailed budget and stick to it. Understand what your take home pay is what you should be withholding in taxes and adjust to make sure you don’t over withhold how much your benefits cost etc. and then allocate the rest of your money to places - for now it should mostly be debt payoff.  Edit: I misread the car part - is there something wrong with your current car? Why do you need to get a different one?
r48ofz,r48ofz,I’m about to make more money than I ever have but I’m pretty seriously in debt…how do I begin digging myself out?,Zandradee,11/28/2021,1.0,To begin a little summary of where I’m sitting.   I owe $7000 (20.99% APR) to credit card #1 and $7000 (13.99% APR) to credit card #2 and have been making just above minimum payments on each (about $185 and $165 respectively). I have $12000 in student loans (currently in deferment) and a $4600 car loan (the car is currently worth about $7000). All in all I’m roughly $30000 in debt.   I just moved from Connecticut to Los Angeles and am currently in the process of accepting a job with roughly a salary of $80000 (could be as much as $90000 since we’re still negotiating but for the purpose of this I figured we would stay around $80k). I haven’t used the credit cards at all in 2020 as I didn’t want to run the bills any higher.   Currently my monthly bills are $579/month including those two credit card payments a payment on my car loan ($109/month) and my other little odds and ends monthly charges such as Spotify my phone bill ($90/month) etc.   I should be clear that this current car is the one I have back in CT. My dad needs a car and he’s out there so I could either let him drive it and take over the payment or I could sell it and completely pay it off. This is no problem.   The advice I’m looking for here is broken down into a few different questions.   1. How should I pay down my debts and raise my credit score? What order should I pay things in/should I be aggressive right out of the gate to get everything down or should I plan more gradual repayment?  2. My student loan is in deferment currently because I’ve been out of work for the last 18 months or so so those payments aren’t immediately pressing right this very second (but they will be once I update my income information) so I do I go about handling that? 3. What should I do with this in general? This is way more money than I’ve ever made and I want to have savings for the first time in my life. I don’t know how to be smart with so much income.  4. I do need to get a car…am I better off buying/leasing something fuel efficient (gas is so expensive here in SoCal) or buying an old beater car outright (and avoiding the monthly payment but also inevitably having to pay more for gas)? I’ve been driving for 10 years now with no accidents so my insurance is pretty cheap (I’m female if that matters and actually affects insurance prices I’m not sure) 5. I’m currently living with my fiancé’s family and I want to get my own place to live this year as well…can I afford rent on top of all of this? I just need a small one bedroom place and if it has to wait until my debt is paid off so be it. I just want to work towards that goal.   This mountain of debt has always felt impossible for me and this job really feels like someone is tossing me a shovel to dig myself out and I just want to be as smart and efficient about it as I possibly can.   I hope all of this makes sense. I was’t taught much about budgeting growing up and both of my parents are in serious debt so I’m looking to keep as far from their paths as possible. Please let me know if you need any clarification! Thank you all for your help in advance.  TLDR: I’m about to start making $80000 a year and I’m roughly $30000 in debt. Help.

But if she can prove that all of the money in the account was hers with a paper trail like paystubs matching deposits she should be able to win a judgement in court against the father.  Of course she will not be able to get back any money that he deposited.  I would recommend sitting him down and politely explaining to him that what he did was illegal and if he doesnt return the money you will be taking him to court.  If that fails pay a few hundred dollars to have a lawyer send a demand letter that will probably scare him into returning the money.  If that fails your only option is court.  This will of course burn her bridges with her father but I would argue that the father already burned down that bridge.  Regardless of what path you take about the $12000 make sure to separate her financially from him.  Set up an account in just her name at a different bank and withdraw any money left in the joint account as cash and deposit it into the new account.  The reason for not just transferring money is that you dont want the father to know where she banks or her new account info.  Parents usually have enough personal info to defeat online and over the phone security and can get into her new account if they know where it is.

But thats entirely up to the courts on how they decide that.  Ive seen people get and lose everything at the whims of the judge and how the judge thinks the case actually played out in their head.  But this is why you _never_ cosign on loans or put a joint account holder on your primary deposit accounts.  Id recommend against it even when married honestly.  Get a joint account at a secondary bank you pay joint bills from instead.

My girlfriend (23) just went on a trip to Jamaica with me and my family for my brothers wedding. She still lives at home with her parents since she just graduated college recently but we had both been saving up to move out in a few months. She had told her parents that we were going on the trip and they were initially okay with it but her dad changed his mind at the last minute. She decided to go anyways because obviously the hotel and plane tickets had already been purchased and shes an adult who can make these decisions for herself. Since returning home her dad has gone full control freak and taken away her phone her car and the $12000 that she had been saving up for the past 2 years.   Thankfully she got a hold of the car title and its in her name so that should work out fine. But the bank account she had been using was still connected to her dads account. Is there any legal recourse she could take to get her money back say if shes able to prove income? Her parents are both here in the US illegally so wed rather not get police involved if we dont have to but we will if thats our only option. We also live in the state of North Carolina if that is relevant information.   Thanks so much in advance to anyone who answers. This whole situation is a clusterfuck that Ive never been in before.

r489ma,hmf0ctb,Budget Help Please,alan_grant93,11/28/2021,4.0,I’ve always used a spreadsheet. But before you get there - do you and your wife acknowledge there is a problem? Are you both committed to understanding the problem and working to fix it? If you can’t get on the same page no app will help. (And making more money won’t help either - it finds a way of walking out the door.)  When I first started budgeting I looked at the last three months of credit card and bank statements. Have each purchase rough categories (food household car etc.) I averaged what I was spending added a small cushion added it all up… and saw I was spending more than I was making. That’s okay! I reduced my budget in certain areas took out cash for each budget and put it into an envelope and got super intentional about each purchase.  Money is tough especially in a new relationship/marriage. Lots of wants (house car vacation kids) and not always money to back it up. Getting on the same page for goals then set up a reasonable budget you can both stick to will help.

r48g1z,hmf2mzd,How does compounding interesting work for equities,DeluxeXL,11/28/2021,3.0,Its called compound growth not compound interest. Stocks dont pay interest.   **The core concept of compounding is to grow from what has already been grown.**   For bank accounts this is an easy concept.. you just dont withdraw the interest after it has been paid to you each month. Then the interest becomes a part of the principal and grows.   For stocks you reinvest dividend after it has been paid to you (instead of spending it).  However for stocks compound growth also has one more component that compound interest doesnt have: Price growth.  If a company grows 10% its stock price goes up by 10% **from the previous value** not from the price you originally bought at. For example S&P 500 grows around 10% per year on average over the long term. That doesnt mean its price index goes from 1000 to 1100 to 1200 to 1300 of the starting 1000. No. Instead it goes from 1000 to 1100 to 1210 to 1331 and so on.  Compounding is there the whole time.  For a company in order to not compound it has to stop growing in any way. No expansions no new R&D etc. Just stagnant. This isnt what a normal company does.
r48g1z,hmf61lm,How does compounding interesting work for equities,BitOBear,11/28/2021,1.0,The only thing thats close to compounded interest in stocks would be dividend reinvestment programs. That is stock programs particularly those issued by the company themselves will automatically buy more shares or fractions of shares with the money they would have sent you as a dividend.  So like if you had AT& T stock for a long time you had the option of taking your quarterly dividend and using it to automatically buy more AT&T stock. So if you bought a hundred shares and three months later it earned you a $10 dividend and the stock price was $10 a share you now have 101 shares. Since youd have more shares at that point your next dividend would be larger because you have more shares not because the dividend per share was necessarily larger and you might end up with 103 shares instead of 102 due to that compounding.   So in the simplest analysis stock price rises or falls and you get dividends if youre lucky but there is no compounding at all.   However your stock brokerage or your stock plan from a company might simulate compounding by putting profits back into the pool of stock ownership instead of issuing you a check.
r48my8,r48my8,Where’s the best place to look for the capital gains income tax for my given state?,DexterTwerp,11/28/2021,1.0,I’ve looked around and it’s saying 0% for individuals that make under 80k. I’m very skeptical about that.
r48my8,hmf5dce,Where’s the best place to look for the capital gains income tax for my given state?,wild_b_cat,11/28/2021,1.0,I believe short term capital gains are treated as income in all states regardless so thats not a question. The question is how they treat long term gains: in some states its also ordinary income while other states have a separate LTCG rate.
r48my8,hmf3irk,Where’s the best place to look for the capital gains income tax for my given state?,wild_b_cat,11/28/2021,2.0,Just google it and you can find a million answers. If you want an official source go to your states tax agency and look through their published documents.  The most important question is whether your state treats capital gains like regular income - most states do which means your capital gains tax is the same as any other kind of income. If you know that then it makes it easy to just look up the rate table for your state and compare with your income.

r48k2h,hmf8613,Hospital bill sent to collections,positivelycat,11/28/2021,1.0,Balances in collections likely wont be on the patient portal. These are likely 2 different bills ( doctor and hospital). Call the hospital and get the doctors billing company number  ( if different) and provide them with your insurance.
r48k2h,hmf9o91,Hospital bill sent to collections,Overclked_Potato,11/28/2021,1.0,Thanks for the advice and for sharing your experience! Planning to do just this when they open tomorrow morning.
r48k2h,r48k2h,Hospital bill sent to collections,Overclked_Potato,11/28/2021,0.0,Last year I went to the emergency room for an asthma attack. I was pretty confused going in since I was having trouble breathing and didn’t remember giving them any billing info. Coming out stopped by the receptionist to confirm but took her word that they had my info without seeing it myself. I assumed I’d get resolved by my insurance.  Fast forward to today a year later I get a bill in the mail from a collections company saying the bill is in collections. This was the first I heard of it and after reviewing my discharge papers from last year it looks like they had the hospital address and a default phone number for me. My insurance doesn’t have a record of it being paid either and the bill isn’t on my credit report. Stumbling around the hospital’s home page I managed to find a patient portal that listed the bill around $300 which is significantly less than the $1000 bill sent from collections too.   I’ve drafted a letter to the collections company asking for verification of the debt to send via certified mail and plan to call the hospital and my insurance tomorrow morning.  So my questions are: 1. Who typically would own the debt here? 2. How do I make sure this doesn’t go on my credit report as I wasn’t aware of it until now? 3. Am I on the right track?
r48k2h,hmf71pv,Hospital bill sent to collections,Fish-Weekly,11/28/2021,1.0,Call the hospital billing department and ask them to submit the charges to insurance tell them you will pay promptly once the insurance has been properly filed. The hospital should be able to pull the charge back from collections - I have had a similar situation occur in the past and this is how it was handled.  The written notice to the collection agency is a good idea also I did that as well in the situation I had. All got resolved in my case hope the same for you.

Almost like playing a game of probability that gets worse the more time you wait

r48jme,r48jme,Planning on buying a house. Timing and markets,Hathaur,11/28/2021,1.0,Hello  I’m in the very beginning phases of planning for a potential house purchase in a year or so. Haven’t locked down a specific area or anything really yet. Rough price limit is under $200k. Just working on saving money and making sure my credit is good. My question is mostly about housing as an investment. The advice often is time in the market > timing the market. Does this apply to housing as well even if my purchase isn’t for strictly investment reasons?  I could possibly buy by next July/August but is there ever justification in waiting a couple months or even a year? With the housing and rental markets the way they are I’d love to not be spending more money on rent and get into a house sooner but id also rather buy at a better time or in a better market. Thoughts or advice? Also happy for any planning advice in general as I start on this journey. Thanks in advance!
r48g1z,hmf2e18,How does compounding interesting work for equities,zacce,11/28/2021,2.0,Stocks dont pay interest so theres no compounding interest. However stocks benefit from compounding growth.   Instead of $5 amount growth consider a 50% return growth. If the stock grows 50% twice it will be (1+50%)*(1+50%)-1= 125% growth versus 2x50% growth.
r48g1z,hmf24dk,How does compounding interesting work for equities,Justice-Gorsuch,11/28/2021,2.0,You invest $100 today and the stock goes up by 10% or $10 dollars after year 1. Total investment investment now equals $110.   Year 2: stock goes up again by 10% but this time that equals $11. Total ending value is $121.   Year 3: stock goes up by 10% or $12.10. Ending value is $133.10.   As you can see even though in the above example your stock is rising by an equal 10% you’re still applying that percentage to a higher base amount so you’re gaining more each year.
r48g1z,r48g1z,How does compounding interesting work for equities,Silliestgoose,11/28/2021,1.0,Hey folks For some reason I’m absolutely stumped on figuring this out but basically what I’m trying to understand is how does one gain compounding interest work for the stock market. I know everyone says invest early and often to take advantage of compounding interest where basically you gain money on your previous gains. Which makes conceptual sense for basic savings accounts or maybe even dividend stocks. But for plain old equity how does it work. I buy a share and the only gain I’m making is on that one share I bought growing from its original price. i buy a share for 5 dollars it grows another 5 to 10 bucks I gained 100% it grows another 5 I’ve gained 200% there is no compounding here? I don’t know why it’s hard to conceptualize this for me.
r48g1z,hmf27sk,How does compounding interesting work for equities,MDfoodie,11/28/2021,3.0,The use of compounding *interest* isn’t technically right for equities.  Since your cost basis is a single point you can view it as growth from purchase (i.e. 400% over 30 years).   Others prefer to look at average year over year growth (i.e. 6% annually). In this instance you can apply the concept of compounding as each subsequent 6% growth is on a higher principle balance.  Don’t think too hard. You have the right understanding.

r4959e,hmf5mt3,"Considering a $3,100 loan from Upstart... any advice?",MDfoodie,11/28/2021,4.0,Don’t take out a loan to pay off a debt. All you are doing is mindlessly moving money around. Just stop using your card and pay it off with income…it’s only $1200.  You don’t worry about credit score when you have debt at 27% APR.
r4959e,hmf6awf,"Considering a $3,100 loan from Upstart... any advice?",theDreadMold,11/28/2021,1.0,Its not that anything is stopping me. I just figured paying less interest and having a paid off loan would be a good idea. I am definitely no expert on any of this but am trying to figure it all out.
r49blt,hmf89eg,Are there homes without HOA fees near the NYC/NJ area?,purpleinthebrain,11/28/2021,2.0,It usually is. I live in Florida and found a home with no HOA. HOAs can suck but they do keep the community from looking crazy which can drive down the value of your home. Fortunately I live in a subdivision where everyone is super clean and maintain their properties really nicely.
r4959e,r4959e,"Considering a $3,100 loan from Upstart... any advice?",theDreadMold,11/28/2021,1.0,Short background: I do not have significant credit card debt but its around $1200 at 27% APR. Upstart requires me in my state to take a minimum loan of $3100. I make around $31000 a year gross and my living expenses are low but it would still take me a while to get my utilization down... I have very low limits on 2 cards (my limit for both cards combined is $1500). My credit score is around 645 and I think getting my utilization lower could make a big impact on my score. Plus I have never had any loans other than my student loans that are in deferment.  So I was also thinking the loan may help me once I pay it off.   &#x200B  My plan is to pay off all credit card debt and then use the remainder of the loan towards making about twice the minimum payments of the loan.   Loan terms:  $3100   No origination fee  No prepayment penalties  11.9% APR  3 Years   Minimum Monthly Payment: $102  The overall goal is just to increase my credit score and get a better rate for when I plan to purchase a car in about a 1.5 years.   Any advice or thoughts?
r4959e,hmfb4is,"Considering a $3,100 loan from Upstart... any advice?",cgally,11/28/2021,1.0,I would imagine you would be approved if you applied for a discover card. You can take advantage of their 12 and 18 month promotional balance transfer offers. I would not take another high interest loan out to pay off those balances. FYI The reason they make you take a minimum amount is because of the rate they are charging. Theres no state law that dictates the minimum amount of a loan.  Yes utilization makes up about 25% of your credit score. Ideally you dont want to use more than 35% of your overall available credit.
r4959e,hmf6g33,"Considering a $3,100 loan from Upstart... any advice?",theDreadMold,11/28/2021,1.0,It just seems like with my credit score I get really low limit offers... and I dont want to take on another credit card with a <$1000 limit. Id rather raise my score then get a better card later.

I got my first salary career and immediately wanted a new car. Went to a lot to test drive a car suddenly was signing my life away. It is single-handedly the dumbest thing Ive ever done and need help. The car salesman knew it was a bad idea but wanted a big sale on a sports car. End of the day my fault and my responsibility.

Im able to make my $1000 payment because my wife and I have decent jobs but I have little residual income. I listen to people on the internet and people like Dave Ramsay make me feel like I need to live on rice and beans but I just want to not have this burden over my head every month. My biggest fear is that something happens and this car loan screws me.  Any advice? I dont know anything about private selling or have anyone to take over payments as the loan is suicide. My knowledge of loans and cars is limited hence me making this initial purchase.

r49c5v,hmfdzmo,We have money we don't know what to do with,Unoriginal_White_Guy,11/28/2021,1.0,Please do not go down the index life insurance route unless you have exhausted all other retirement options. Three-four years ago every insurance company started pushing these hard. These policies only really work as an investment if you overfund them just below the MEC limit. Insurance companies have agents push these as a pseudo-investment since withdrawals from the cash value later in life are technically tax free because its not a withdrawal it is considered a loan. I have a very good friend that has pretty much exhausted all other retirement options available and makes way too much to contribute to a ROTH. The thought process is overfund a life insurance policy and when he goes to take loans from the policy in retirement it is a source of tax free income. As I said it has its pros for high earners that wont have access to tax free income in retirement but the fees are expensive since it is a life insurance policy. COI (Cost of Insurance) goes up as you get older and this will eat into the cash value later in life. My advice is to talk to a CPA and see if there is any other avenues to contribute more to your existing retirement accounts before you think about going the life insurance route.
r49c5v,hmfg1p3,We have money we don't know what to do with,t3chiman,11/28/2021,1.0,>	…option to open a brokerage account and invest…  It’s cheap and easy that’s why folks recommend it.

r49c5v,hmfig1i,We have money we don't know what to do with,micha8st,11/28/2021,1.0,Thats what we did -- invest in a taxable investment account.  Notice I dont say brokerage.  We started first with Mutual funds.  A few years later we decided to start gambling in a brokerage account (back then you couldnt buy stock at Vanguard or Fidelity -- at least that I knew of ).  I call that our mid-term investing account  -- meaning its intended for the years before you can access your retirement accounts.  I strongly recommend that.  I have this nasty feeling that Congress is going to make more changes to retirement accounts both by decreasing the ability to access prior to 59 1/2 and also by increasing the age to say 62.  Maybe Im paranoid.  I would not ever invest in life insurance.  Personally I dont want to be a landlord.  One thing weve invested in is REITs.  REIT stands for Real Estate Investment Trusts.  There are different options.  Our REITs are stock -- ones a Mall / Shopping center company the other is a medical building company.  There are others -- two different companies that operate data centers.  I believe there are REIT ETFs/Mutual funds.  And then at the most pure form there are REITs where the partners invest directly in real estate.  Home-based real estate is gang-busters here in the US but what about business space?

r49c5v,hmfcqoe,We have money we don't know what to do with,yogaballcactus,11/28/2021,5.0,> ...indexed life insurance as an option.  No. Until you have enough money to worry about the estate tax (so $23MM for a married couple under current law) you do not need any fancy life insurance products. These products charge very high fees and return less than the stock market would. The insurance companies guarantee them but if the economy does so poorly that stocks dont beat insurance products then the insurance companies are probably going bankrupt anyway. Bankrupt companies do not meet their guarantees. If anyone (spouse or kids) is depending on your income to live then you need term life insurance but thats it.   I also want to make sure that you actually have extra money. How much are you putting away for retirement? If youre not putting 20% of your gross income into either target date retirement funds with low fees or broad index funds with low fees then you shouldnt be considering other investments. It should be more than 20% if you got a late start on the whole investing thing. Putting 20% into target date retirement funds or index funds for your entire career comes as close as it is possible to come to guaranteeing your ability to retire by 65. It does not make sense to take big risks when your ability to retire on time is in question.   Once you are putting enough away for retirement you can explore some riskier things. But can does not mean should. Every dollar you put into the stock market above that 20% is highly likely to move your retirement date up. If you put 30% into the stock market for your entire career then you can probably retire in your early 50s instead of at 65. You also (so long as you dont buy on margin or anything like that) cannot lose more than you invest. When you start a business or buy real estate or do most other things that are meant to generate money you can lose more than you invest. Possibly enough to put your retirement at 65 at risk or even bankrupt you. So the best thing for normal people to do is usually to invest in the stock market.   But if you want to try something else then the traditional thing to do is to buy real estate. Real estate is risky. You can lose more than you put in. You also can have long periods where it generates no cash or even burns cash. For example I plan to turn the condo I live in now into a rental when I eventually move out of it. Im *hoping* it will break even on a cash basis. Realistically Ill probably have to put some money into the maintenance out of my own pocket every year. But the renter should pay down the mortgage by more than it costs me to maintain it so Ill walk away with a ton of cash when I eventually sell it especially if real estate values go up a bit between now and then. Oh and Ill also have to spend some time managing the renters. And Ill also need to come up with the down payment on my next place in cash instead of using my equity in this place. Overall it should be a good deal but its not going to be easy or simple and it wouldnt work if I wasnt generating way more cash from my 9-5 than I needed. And I could get a bad renter who wrecks the place and costs me a ton of money. Or the market could drop like a rock and I could be chained to this place forever. So its a big risk.
r49c5v,hmfa7rv,We have money we don't know what to do with,justLouis,11/28/2021,4.0,A bit different and just something for peace of mind.   Life Insurance – covers almost all types of death.  AD&D Insurance – covers accidental death and some dismemberments.  Disability Insurance – covers disability from illness or accident.   You could contribute to an HSA if eligible. So many low expense ratio aolid ETFs to choose from that have low risk average 6-8% average return. The market is the greatest wealth building tool we all have available to us.

r49c5v,hmf82bg,We have money we don't know what to do with,Neighbor1973,11/28/2021,5.0,Congrats on being in a great spot financially!! I would stay far away from life insurance as a way to earn a return on your money - too many fees/costs.  With real estate prices sky high and bond yields at all time lows there are not many options other than the stock market.  Depending on how much money you have you could consider becoming an angel investor for startups or even later stage businesses but that is obviously very risky.  It also doesnt hurt to keep money on the sidelines to see if the stock market drops over the next few months as a result of the new Covid variant and the Fed reducing stimulus.  Long term it is hard to go wrong investing in US stocks.

Are you describing a 401(k) as retirement being taken care of? Given the right amount of contribution and lifestyle goals it certainly might be but investing beyond the maximum 401(k) contribution would be my first thought. Taxable brokerage for a year or up to a set threshold then shift to prioritizing Roth IRAs.

r49blt,r49blt,Are there homes without HOA fees near the NYC/NJ area?,Moist-Bandicoot39,11/28/2021,0.0,I checked on Zillow and every place had an HOA fee or HOA was labeled No Data. I also talked to a Zillow agent that suggested to me that basically every place has HOA fees.  To me HOA fees seem like theyre basically rent. After you own a property you still pay HOA fees as if theyre rent. Supposedly they cover expenses for some other things (sometimes maintenance) but I am honestly not convinced that having an HOA is much cheaper or much easier than hiring your own maintenance. They also can sometimes be a pain to deal with bureaucratically right?  I guess separately from the above is an HOA worth it?  Edit: I guess the upstate new york area might also be ok.

r4948v,hmfk90c,"Over my head in a car loan, how do I get out of it the smartest/best way?",Stable-McCafe,11/28/2021,1.0,Thats a huge hit. The depreciation of a new car upfront is so tremendous (which is why youll see people buying older cars).   Out of curiosity how long ago did you buy the car?   You need to look at little more make a bunch of calls to dealerships and see wholl pay how much for your car. Compare and hopefully you can get a little more than $46k.  Heres some rough calcs for you:  So $64k-$46k= $18k (upfront loss)  Heres how you can justify the $15k car. Think about how much interest (with your 8%) youre paying over 60 months (?) term on the $64k car.. almost $13k.  $15k car will make your monthly payments to ~$300. Youll pay $3k in interest over 60 months with 8% interest rate. So you save $10k in interest.   Your actual loss is $18k - $10k= $8k. And your monthly payments go from $1000/m to $300/m.   Edit 1: just realized that your term is 84 months!!! So your interest alone on the $64k car is almost $20k. Recalc my numbers accordingly.

Do not rollover after-tax balance to a traditional 401k  Thats a special case right and would have taken special reporting to make that happen? Is there an easy way to confirm this? All of these Trad Iras would have been normal non-payroll contributions and would have been part of the filing deduction minus whatever limits applied during that year.
r491cl,r491cl,Questions about recharacterization and backdoors,DirkLurker,11/28/2021,0.0,Due to a mid-year raise were going to exceed the MAGI limit to qualify for Roth contributions. I understand that I need to recharacterize our 2021 contributions into traditional IRAs. We have existing Traditional IRAs that we never backdoored into Roths - this means when I recharacterize Ill be subject to the the pro-rata rule if I try to then backdoor it.    &nbsp  It seems like I have three options listed in preferred priority(I think) &nbsp  Option 1    * Transfer & empty all Traditional Iras to Traditional 401k by 12/31 * Recharacterize 2021 Roth contributions as a non-deductible contribution to Traditional Ira by 4/15 * Contribute remaining non-deductible 2021 contribution amount to each of our Traditionals by 4/15 * Complete annual backdoor roth conversion by 4/15  Option 2  * recharacterize by 12/31 and start to batch yearly backdoors that keep us in our marginal tax bracket and spread the conversion tax out along the next 5 to 10 years  Option 3    * Just recharacterize and leave them in traditional until we retire I think we would only do this if our 401k(s) didnt accept Ira rollovers and didnt think backdooring existing accounts would be worth the effort  &nbsp     Question/Discussion  * Option 1 seems like the best plan since I can then do a simple backdoor every year going forward Am I on the right track? Anything Im not understanding? * Option 2 seems less desirable because of the timeline and tax hit during prime earning years * Still a bit confused on how 2021 earnings are taxed When I request the recharacterizations does Vanguard calculate the contributions and gains those specific contributions made?   &nbsp   Account Details          His Accounts Age 44     a) Traditional Ira #1 - $22808 - contributed $600 in 2021     b) Traditional Ira #2 - $40224 - contributed $0 in 2021     c) Roth Ira           - $25321 - contributed $3946 in 2021      d) Traditional 401k   -        - employer-sponsored          Her Accounts Age 45     a) Traditional Ira #1 - $51027 - contributed $0 in 2021     c) Roth Ira           - $28069 - contributed $4384 in 2021      d) Traditional 401k   -        - employer-sponsored
r491cl,hmf5s9o,Questions about recharacterization and backdoors,nothlit,11/28/2021,2.0,The potential issue looming over all of this is that Congress is halfway to banning the backdoor method starting next year. If the Build Back Better Act gets passed into law with its current language you would not be allowed to do any Roth conversions containing after-tax money after 12/31/2021. So if you can accelerate your option 1 plan and get every step of it done before the end of this year that would probably be the safest approach.

Correct.  Vanguard will do everything for you.  May I suggest a modification to Option 1?  * Recharacterize first. (Lets assume 6K contributions became 7K) * Reverse Rollover to 401k ALL Trad IRA minus Contribution (Trad IRA - 6K = total reverse rolled over).  (Youre throwing the 1K gains into the 401k) * Convert the Trad IRA to Roth.

r491cl,hmf7cic,Questions about recharacterization and backdoors,DeluxeXL,11/28/2021,2.0,> We have existing Traditional IRAs that we never backdoored into Roths   frontdoored  A normal taxable Roth conversion isnt using the backdoor.  Option 1 seems the best move **done in that order** but as early as possible. Keep in mind that Roth conversion doesnt have a deadline -- it acts on the mixed balance inside your IRA accounts not on any particular contribution. It just goes in whichever calendar year the conversion actually happens in.  Definitely dont do option 3. Growth from after-tax balance are taxed as ordinary income which is worse than long term capital gain if you had invested in a taxable account.  > Still a bit confused on how 2021 earnings are taxed When I request the recharacterizations does Vanguard calculate the contributions and gains those specific contributions made?  Nothing is taxable until you do a Roth conversion. Recharacterization is not taxable. It just changes the type of contribution.  Vanguard calculates the amount that needs to be moved over during recharacterization using the [net income attributable formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income_attributable). This formula is actually written into law.  Using his accounts for example.  >     His Accounts Age 44 >     a) Traditional Ira #1 - $22808 - contributed $600 in 2021 >     b) Traditional Ira #2 - $40224 - contributed $0 in 2021 >     c) Roth Ira           - $25321 - contributed $3946 in 2021  >     d) Traditional 401k   -        - employer-sponsored  Step 1) Reverse-rollover all pretax IRA ($22808 + $40224 - $600) to d. **Be careful. Do not rollover after-tax balance to a traditional 401k**   Step 2) Recharacterize the $3946 Roth IRA contribution + NIA to traditional IRA. Lets say it has grown 20% so $3946 and $789 together are moved to traditional IRA  Step 3) Contribute the remaining $1454 to traditional IRA  Step 4) The IRA basis is therefore as follows:    * $600 nondeductible contribution to traditional IRA (see a)  * $3946 nondeductible contribution to traditional IRA (recharacterized from c)  * $1454 nondeductible contribution to traditional IRA (see step 3)  * From the three above the **IRA basis** is $6000 i.e. all the nondeductible contributions in the past minus any amount previously converted  * $6789 account balance in all non-Roth IRAs ($600 + $3946 + $789 + $1454)  Step 5) (OPTIONAL) Feel free to reverse-rollover again to move $789 to 401k leaving the IRA balance = $6000.  Step 6) Do a Roth conversion on the entire balance in IRA i.e. covert $6789 (if he skipped step 4) or $6000 (if he did step 4) to Roth IRA. Taxable amount is calculated as follows:   * If he did step 5 none of the $6000 converted is taxable because he has $6000 IRA basis. This conversion depletes the IRA basis in the process.   * If he skipped step 5 the $789 converted portion is taxable because he only has $6000 IRA basis to partially untax the $6789 converted. This conversion depletes the IRA basis in the process.  **Step 6 is the critical step.** On 12/31 of the calendar year in which Roth conversion is performed there should not be any balance in any of his non-Roth IRA. There is a chance that Roth conversion may be restricted by a new law so he should hurry up.

It was $1k but its now $750. It has no income limits. Youre still eligible for the CVRP.  I got the CFR rebate from SCE and got the decal even though my income is above 150k. I just wasnt eligible for the CVRP rebate.
r48x6x,r48x6x,California EV Clean Air Decal and Clean Vehicle Rebate Program,RatinSweet,11/28/2021,1.0,Not sure if this is the right place to ask. I got a model 3 this year and asked in the tesla subreddit but its usually pretty dead there when it comes to topics like this.  So I am filling out an application for Californias CAV decal that allows me to drive in the fast lane for free. I just got the car this year. I noticed at the bottom that at 150K salary and above I can only get CAV and not CVRP. Is the CVRP the $1000 instant rebate when i purchased the vehicle?  Now since this is my first year working and I only started working in April I wont hit the 150K mark for 2021 (and my 2020 income was like 30K). But my total compensation is around 210K and that is expected to go up each year (raises promotions stock refresher etc).  If I took the $1000 rebate this year am I participating in CVRP each year after this year as well? Would that mean I need to refund the $1000 even though I got the rebate when I was making under 150K for the calendar year? The threat of perjury is extremely scary lol

Anything I need to worry about?",Upside_NY,11/28/2021,1.0,I recommend trying to get a pre-approved auto loan from your current bank (I did it with Bank of America). They offered online auto-loan approval which laid out the maximum loan amount and interest rate. When I went to purchase my car at the dealership it became a task for the loan agent at the dealership to try to match the rate granted directly from my bank. They ended up getting me a slightly lower rate through their own lenders so I went with that.  Be careful though because if the dealership loan agent is an idiot (which they likely could be) they can cause unnecessary harm to your credit by improperly running the credit checks with several different lenders (this happened to me but I’m pretty strict with my credit and easily worked it back up afterward).

Its possible that if you buy a $400K house now it might be worth later down the road. Of course if that happens the house you sell would also drop in value. Trying to predict future real estate values is a fools errand. And if you are staying in the same area those gains/loss are largely a wash in the end.   Buy a house you can afford thats right for you in the long run. Dont look at values between now and when you want to sell because its going to fluctuate over time and it doesnt matter in the least if you are staying put.

I want to cash in on the equity available if I sell my home and use that as a down payment on the purchase of another. The housing market in my area is extremely high compared to a few years ago. I may not make enough off the sale to get into a home that I truly want. My question is it worth it to take a loan out of my 401k to add another 30k to my down payment. I’m trying to factor in inflation on home prices vs the gains I will miss out on for the 30k over the next 10-15 years. Any help would be appreciated.   I can afford a 200k home but what I’m looking for truly is around 300k. I mainly worry in 10 years this home will drop in value from 300k to 265k plus the gains loss on the 30k loaned out from the 401k.   Maybe I am over thinking it but if anyone could give some advice I would be very grateful.

Cancel any extended warranties and maintenance plans 2.1 Sell car (Try carvana vroom carmax etc.) and pay remaining balance out of pocket. 2.2 Trade in for cheaper car and roll in negative equity or put down payment to offset it.  The amount this is going to cost you is going to depend on how much you get for the cancellations hiw much you can get for the car and how much you owe overall.  You may come away from this relatively unscathed but be careful next time and do your research... If you need to go 84 months to be able to afford it you cant afford it and 8% is super high.

Both mortgages have low interest rates it’s just that the first house was bought for a decent price and then I payed it down for 5 years then refinanced to a lower rate and extended the term back to 30yrs so the payment went down.   The second house is subject to the current high prices in this hot market since I closed like a month ago.
r4482e,hmepo6q,New Job - Retirement Sanity Check,Pretty_Swordfish,11/28/2021,2.0,Max the 401k and both yours and your wifes IRAs (better for tax purposes at your income). Thatll come out to $32500 per year. Since you are used to living on half your new salary thats still $30k roughly more. Use that to pay off the $5.5k you owe and youll be smooth sailing by March.  Also bonus advice set up a budget so you enter 2022 with a solid plan.

If the company was bought for $200mil with $50mil invested then the VCs will take all the money and you get $0  It could also be a stock swap so your shares are converted into the buying companies stock you could sell on the market.

However the boiling point is reduced by .9 degrees F for every 500 feet in elevation above sea level.

r3unsw,hmevg9e,Why is the lowest credit score 300?,sasafracas,11/28/2021,1.0,This is actually exactly why Im asking the question.  Im using credit scores as a comparison to the 100 pt grading system in schools.  Im trying to get faculty to use a 50 - 100 system since 50% is still failing.  Do we really have to tell students that they not only failed but failed at a spectacular rate of 23%?  Its just weird - and mathematically inaccurate - but thats a longer response than needed in a subreddit on finance :)

r3unsw,hmdlv3z,Why is the lowest credit score 300?,Flakmaster92,11/28/2021,4.0,It’s probably one of those situations where they are pulling in 300 or so different data points at the minimum grade they give for any one data point is 1 rather than 0 or a different number of data points but weighting-adjusted.   Whether that’s still true today who knows I’m sure data points have expanded and the weightings have changed with time but if the weighting came out to like 305 or something “not nice and round” they’d probably just play with the numbers until it was something round. People love round numbers.

This is the gap in common understanding that allows this scam to thrive.

r3unsw,hmeqwu3,Why is the lowest credit score 300?,HorizontalBob,11/28/2021,1.0,FICO doesnt share any of their algorithms but its probably based on not using zero.  Like if I said to rate someone 1-10 on their looks then their personality then their intelligence.  Their total score would be somewhere in the 3-30 range. The lowest score being 3  still seems weird.
r3unsw,hmebix6,Why is the lowest credit score 300?,ronald_mcdonald_4prz,11/28/2021,3.0,That’s because you use a FICO auto score. Not someone’s credit score.

r3unsw,hmeq1ck,Why is the lowest credit score 300?,mrbrambles,11/28/2021,1.0,I’m talking out my ass here but FICO seems proprietary while sat and temp scales are a little more open. There is probably a similar reason as these other scores but they are just more secretive about their methods.   Idk why they can’t just normalize/standardize the range since you can do that to range… but I guess that would be an extra step just for our convenience.

r3ttns,hmdr7gm,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,maartenvanheek,11/28/2021,1.0,Funny this just happened to us yesterday. Asked if the for bench inserted between two sofa pieces was included in the price (it was not) then got a quote that was €50 higher than the combined price tags. When we addressed this the saleswoman quickly pulled off the price tag and said it was a mistake and she can only give us this exact same model for this price. But since we opted for a different fabric in the same price range there was nothing she could do.  Also unlike other customers we werent offered coffee so we will sleep on it. My boyfriend then found out that the same sofa goes for 20-40% discounts at other times of the year so no need to rush to get this black Friday 15%.

I said that jerk around math doesnt work on me I walked in your store and agreed to buy what you advertised at the deal you advertised. If you dont want to sell it cancel the whole deal.   &#x200B  Its not so much the commission on the one deal I think a lot of furniture stores operate on a total sales goal for the rep to earn monthly or quarterly bonuses. If they have slide a few hundred more into a deal they are that much closer to their big payout goal.    I feel like this is a common tactic in furniture and mattress sales.

After I said I would have to think about it he informed me it would be $200 more if I left and came back later today. Super shady

Its usually one year that youll need to live there. Ive never heard of anybody actually getting called on this though.   You will keep the loan with the good rate after you move. You dont have to refinance it and you shouldnt. Some people move every period to a new home so they can open a rental with a low rate loan (rental mortgages have significantly higher rates because theyre riskier for the financial institution). This is called house hacking.

A SEP-IRA is also an option but a 401(k) usually comes out being the somewhat better choice for most people. If the LLC has other employees then shell want to look at a small business 401(k) or a SIMPLE IRA as options for the business (SEP-IRAs are also an option for small businesses).  For individual 401(k) plans Fidelity Schwab or Vanguard are all good options but there are advantages and disadvantages to each.

Picking and choosing effective and reliable warranty programs for items that you might have a higher risk profile for (items that you use significantly more than the average person for example) can save you a decent chunk of change.   Declining warranties in general is a better method than accepting every single one thats offered to you but neither is optimal.

How long that hold lasts has nothing to do with wether the check is cleared it is based on when they are legally required to make the funds available to you.  Generally it is 2 business days for checks written on that bank 5 business days for checks written on other local banks and longer occasionally for special circumstances.  Most people believe the check is good once the funds are available in their account.  That is simply not true.  Generally the most basic verification has been done in that time to make sure things like the account exists there are sufficient funds in the account to cover the check and a stop payment has not been issued on that check number.  But the check can still come back with a bad signature as fraud as stolen etc.  Depending on the reason for denying the check legally they have months or years to decline the check and remove the money from your account.  Imagine this scenario:  Person A has a checking account that they keep lots of money in and they dont get any kind of alert when purchases are made they are old school and balance their checkbook once a month when the statement comes in the mail.  Person B writes a fake check using Person As account info and uses it to buy a car on craigslist from Person C.  Person C deposits the check and after 7 days (5 business days plus the weekend) the money is in their account.  Everyone is happy.  But about a month later Person A gets their bank statement and notices it is short due to a check they didnt write and notifies their bank.  After a week or two the bank determines it was fraud and reverses the check.  Now Person C gets the money taken out of their bank account almost 2 months after they sold their car.  Person C has no car no money a returned check fee and probably some overdraft fees.  There are real world scenarios where the check could return much later even after a year or more also.

r3vt2b,hmdqmq6,What are the financial benefits of marriage?,CQME,11/28/2021,1.0,By far the biggest financial benefit of marriage is a roommate you can trust to split the bills assuming of course you dont egregiously expand your expenses just because you have a bigger household and of course assuming you married someone whos trustworthy (sadly this is not always the case).  Other than that marriage is usually quite costly especially if theres only one breadwinner and especially if you have kids.  Kids are not friendly to your wallet.  Kids arent there to provide you income.  This is why the government steps in to provide tax incentives for marriage and child care because if they didnt most people would think the costs of marriage would be prohibitive.

r3vt2b,hmez5rw,What are the financial benefits of marriage?,hodl3232,11/28/2021,1.0,Since tax brackets are marginal both A and B result in the same total tax amount every time. The only reason to file separately is to get special deductions that get phased out at higher salaries.  For example my wife and I did not qualify for the covid relief payments last year when filing jointly but my wife was able to get them when we filed our taxes separately.
r3vt2b,hmeqdsn,What are the financial benefits of marriage?,Ameteur_Professional,11/28/2021,12.0,Because of the marginal tax bracket system in the US if there is a difference in income its almost as if both spouses are paying taxes on the average income which is cheaper than each paying taxes on their individual income.  This isnt exactly how it works but its almost always cheaper to file jointly.  Married couples also have the option to file separately in situation where that is advantageous.
r3vt2b,hmewqb6,What are the financial benefits of marriage?,Ameteur_Professional,11/28/2021,4.0,No because getting bumped into a bracket doesnt make a huge difference.  Tax rates are marginal.  Youre taxes X% on your first $YYYYY of earnings then Z% on your next $WWWWW of earnings etc.  So even if the top marginal tax rate is the same less money will be taxes at that rate.

r3vt2b,hmdfh9r,What are the financial benefits of marriage?,latentpotential,11/28/2021,7.0,The various deduction caps are a bigger deal than the brackets themselves.  SALT cap? 10k for an individual and 10k for a married couple (so 5k per married person).  Mortgage interest deduction? Up to a 750k loan per individual and also up to a 750k loan for a married couple. An unmarried couple can co-own a house with a 1.5M mortgage and deduct all the interest but the year they get married their mortgage interest deduction will get halved.  This translates to a particularly large marriage penalty for dual high income married couples in high tax states with large mortgages.
r3vt2b,hmerkhk,What are the financial benefits of marriage?,guest0112,11/28/2021,4.0,Came here to say this exact same thing. My wife and I are both gainfully employees for different companies in different fields. We even have different “busy” times. We don’t need as big of an emergency fund as we would if one of us made alllll the money. And now that we’ve started a family if one of us loses a job or we hit a hard patch that one could watch the kid(s) and save us on daycare expenses. I work from home so when one of our cars needs to go in the shop we can rely on the other vehicle easily. We’re also better at different stuff so there’s dozens of ways we financially and non-financially support the other one without always realizing it.   Taxes don’t really help us because our salaries are so similar but it’s nice to know that one day it could. Also if either of us die (hard to think about but necessary to).. there’s the unlimited marital estate tax exemption. We also bought a little less life insurance because we both bought term policies. If I was fully on my own with non marital spouse and kids I’d have had to take out more to guarantee my kids would be okay

That only comes into effect once combined you are making more than $628k per year.

I know pre-2017 the tax brackets didnt line up but they do now (except the top of the 2nd highest bracket but thats a very high income and doesnt affect most people). There could be some issues with itemizing deductions but short of that there shouldnt be any situation where youre better off tax-wise being unmarried (although for similar incomes there arent any benefits either).

I mentioned the previous crash because OPs comment makes it seem like a full proof plan to take out a maximized mortgage. The current low inventory and high prices would generally indicate the market could soften whenever inventory comes back and it has started to in some areas.a 5% down mortgage is also a lot harder to be in a position to make enough money renting your property out and building up savings to account for repairs and maintenance.
r3vkhq,hmelx63,What to start working towards!,CurryMustard,11/28/2021,3.0,The bubble last time happened because of subprime lending. Anybody could get a loan to buy a house regardless of their financial situation. Banks were incentivized to create as many loans as possible no matter how shitty so they could package them up as mortgage backed securities and sell them.. Then people were unable to pay back their loans. Thats not the issue this time. The cfpb put a stop to that. People are moving out of apartments and buying houses at record pace.  There is nothing to indicate that a crash is coming. Even if a crash comes the rental market would stay high or go even higher like last time as people who were foreclosed on had to move to renting. You could rent your house out and keep building equity while waiting for the market to balance out. Having real estate and building equity is almost always a good investment as long as you are in a steady financial situation (i.e. not a high risk of foreclosure).
r3vkhq,hmey9kl,What to start working towards!,CurryMustard,11/28/2021,0.0,Zillow was driving prices up like crazy so thats probably why the market has softened a bit since they stopped buying. Historically prices always dip in the winter anyway. Nothing wrong with 5% down youre still building equity that you wouldnt build by renting. In order for the market to really soften there would have to be a large increase in supply or a large decrease in demand I dont really see that happening anytime soon.

At that low of an interest rate daily vs monthly doesnt make much difference.   Daily compounding turns 0.1% APR into 0.10005% APY.    Monthly compounding would be 0.0100046% just a bit lower.  Annual compounding would be the 0.1%.  It is more likely that the 0.1% is the APY and the actual APR is about 0.09995% compounded daily.  Clearly the 0.5% rate is better.

Spend some time researching investing in broad diversified mutual funds and ETFs for eventual better returns on average.
r3voyn,hmeeb85,"Need help figuring out what's a better offer for a savings account, a ""0.10% dividend rate daily"" or a ""0.50% interest rate monthly.""",LongjumpingMessage36,11/28/2021,2.0,0.1% interest compounded per period (day) you can adjust the period to be annual by doing (1+0.1%)^365 - 1 = about 44% per year.  So if you put in $1 today in 365 days you’d have $1.44. That’s way higher than market rates so that’s either a scam or it’s an annual rate.   Interest rates are usually quoted on an annualized basis for comparability. For example a 12% rate compounded monthly is (1+1%)^12 -1 and a 12% rate compounded semiannually is (1+6%)^2 -1.

I used to use Wells Fargo and switched to chase.   And then I transfer money to and from my Marcus online HYSA. Since I referred my wife we are both getting 1% APY for the next 3 months. I used to keep my money in the Wells Fargo savings account which had an APY of 0.01%. So it’s a big difference.   I have heard that sometimes local credit unions can give a high APY. Like 0.5% or more. That will depend on the credit union and the area. Look around.   There are also other well known online bank companies with HYSA like American Express (0.4%) and capital one (0.4%).  I also saw a newer online bank called “one” and they have 1.0% APY. Which sounds good and is FDIC insured like the other ones but I chose the Marcus one over that one since Marcus is more well known and I didn’t want to go with a newer company.

I flat out tell them if you want me to buy anything here leave me alone and I will find you.  My ex and I wanted two matching leather sofas for our den.  We went to a local furniture store and found ones we liked.  We asked for a 20% discount because we knew that furniture markup is up to 600%.  They played the manager game and said no.  We walked.  3 weeks later the same store had a buy one get one sale.  We got our matching couches for a 50% discount instead.  NEVER hesitate to walk out if they wont give you a reasonable deal. Sucking it up and buying when you know you are getting screwed will leave a bad taste in your mouth and every time you sit in that chair.

r3tpla,hmdlzp9,How can I convince my employer to improve benefits?,Pass_Little,11/28/2021,2.0,Is this a small business or a giant one?   It will be easier to encourage a small one to change)  Also how few vacation days and does this increment with longevity?   If this is a you get a week off and youll never get one more day no matter how long you work here thing then you might find that this is a place that doesnt value their employees.  I know that in relation to vacation I tend to ratchet up the number of weeks of vacation as the employees reach longevity and/or raise milestones.   2 weeks at hire with additional weeks added as time goes on as part of employee reviews.  But for the rest of the benefits this might just be an issue of having never taken the time to review the cost of their benefits to determine if they can provide something better for a similar amount of cost.   Or they might think something costs a lot more than it does.  For example some mediocre health insurance costs a horrendous amount of money.   By contrast A good HDHP often has lower premiums and often has a lower max out of pocket than a normal health plan.   The reason is that the HDHP doesnt cover most little things like broken arms or multiple doctors visits (other than a wellness visit or two per year).   By focusing on providing 100% coverage once you reach a deductible (often around $3-5K) they are able to reduce the premium costs.   From the employees perspective they know that they are never going to need more than the deductible for health costs in a year.  With a HDHP you can then open a HSA which allows you to pay for almost anything medical pre-tax and the money is yours forever if you dont spend it this year.      Using this as an example often employers just get health insurance from whatever salesperson walks through the door first so they can list that as a benefit on their job listings.   There is every chance that this is what happened so they have this crap plan just because thats what some salesperson sold to them.   If you can show them that they could switch and it would either save them money or only cost them a little more to get a much better plan for their employees most would do this.  401ks are similar.   Some 401k plans cost employers hundreds of dollars per year per employee just to have the plan.   Others cost much less.    Also some 401k plans are horrible from the employees viewpoint because they have crap options.  And if they didnt do their research they probably have both a crap plan for the employees and are paying way too much for it.  Oh and the life insurance:  If this is valuable to you you should just go buy a term plan on your own.  When I went looking for this as a employee benefit I found the plans available to employers were generally poor quality (lots of exclusions) and way too expensive.

His circumstances are different from yours in that he was able to bring 50% of the value of the new house as a check at closing. But he talked to the bank he does his business out of. They were much more accommodating than a national bank and ended up just keeping the loan in house to keep a good client happy. I cant say that solves all your problems but if you have a local bank you already have a relationship with they will be far more accommodating than a national bank.

Then at some point before the 3rd month I got a letter or something saying that unlesss I paid in full by the 3rd month I would get some charge or interest hit of the whole thing that was a lot I don’t remember but they 100% baited and switched me

r3ttns,hme1me2,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,heelstoo,11/28/2021,1.0,This is exactly why I take pictures of everything when I buy something expensive- the item in the store it’s tags it’s model numbers and any other information related to it. If possible I also try to research the specific item before I buy it so I find the one I want in-store take my pictures and go home to see if I can find a better price reviews etc.   My spouse *hates* car shopping because of all of the pressures that the salespersons put on people but I love it.

But if it was a mistake why is the salesman trying to get the customer to pay for the store’s mistake? Why not handle the mistake on the back end without involving the customer? That would be the honest way to handle a pricing mistake.
r3ttns,hme3i7r,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,FUDnot,11/28/2021,1.0,They are not required to sell it to you at the sticker price.

It came with a fairly extensive warranty but they had a guy trying to upsell a better warranty. I’ve never been one to go for something like that but I let them talk to me. (My wife was surprised I let them talk to me as long as I did). I finally let them know I wasn’t interested and they went with the hard sell letting me know about all the stuff that could go wrong and that it would be covered.   I finally looked at him and told him that I don’t know if I want to buy a vehicle that the dealership has so little confidence in and got up to start to walk out.   I’ve never seen such a quick about face.

I swear its like most people on reddit are paranoid schizophrenics or live under a rock. They mistagged it and either were afraid to report to management in fear it was their fault or the manager rejected to save face.  Speak personally to management or corporate. It is doubtful anyone tried to pull the wool over your eyes by bait and switching you over less than 10% of the cost of the item which the sales rep probably wouldnt see any significant commission from the sale.
r3ttns,hmf1bs2,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,kiLLxander,11/28/2021,1.0,Legally if an item is marked at a certain price that’s the price the store is obligated to sell the item for. Even if the price is marked wrong.  What that doesn’t extend to is if the item is marked wrong. For example if a mirror is marked as $100 but the tag says sofa.

r3ttns,hme2j1z,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,AyeMyHippie,11/28/2021,1.0,I used to work in a furniture store and it could have been either tbh. They tend to pay low for support staff (the people who move the stuff around help customers load stuff clean the place etc) and get some real dummies as a result. But salesmen also tend to be a little sleazy in most industries and the furniture industry is no different.   The fact that he went out of the way to throw the “incompetent” staff under the bus instead of just saying it was a mistake leads me to believe that it wasn’t just a mix up though. If the guy was willing to talk shit about his coworkers to save some face it’s probably not a stretch to say he’d do some shitty stuff to try to earn a few extra bucks.

r3ttns,hme71vx,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,readwiteandblu,11/28/2021,2.0,Since you brought up cars (Fargo scene) Ill tell you my story. In early 2007 I bought a 2003 Acura from a dealer for half what a new one cost. It had 50k miles on it and was out of warranty. I bought an extended warranty for about $2000 which basically gave me a same as new deal. This wasnt CPO btw as I was buying from a Honda dealership.  The warranty was close to having run out when I felt a very small surge and took it in to be looked at in an abundance of caution. Turned out I needed a new transmission.   I found my policy and when I told the Acura dealer the policy was from Zurich they said they were absolutely the best and I would have no problems. Three days later my car was fixed and Zurich paid everything including my rental of a current model Acura same model all with no copay deductible or any other cash out of my pocket. I would 100% use them again.

r3ttns,hmehrxh,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,brooksms,11/28/2021,1.0,I recently ordered a custom couch. My sales person gave general price range based on the models I thought could work. Fabric choice apparently has a big impact on the final cost though. With my selection the quote was $700 more then I anticipated which was already $1000 higher because I shifted to a nicer brand. When I hesitated and told her it surpassed the range I’d initially considered she went back to see if there was anything they could do. Instant money off the price. I really hated that part because now I won’t be able to trust her when I want more furniture. Why can’t the prices just be what they are?

Drove right back out and come to find out apparently that machine was put out by accident. It had been a return after it was twice sent to them for repair. Before I even had the chance to get upset the repair manager worked with the store manager to get me the same model new in box for the cost of the refurb.   I now buy almost all of my tech there.

r3ttns,hmdd7uq,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,MoonFireAlpha,11/28/2021,3.0,Having worked in retail most places have insurance on everything. Since it’s usually something you don’t want or because of laziness a lot of employees never ask if you want it. I’m not sure how it works at Costco.   The kind of sale sticker error I can definitely understand as there’s so much turn over in retail and even then usually everywhere is understaffed and so nothing is being done 100% correctly.   The reg not ringing up a sales price is definitely a tactic for the store to make more money but it’s not the individual salespersons fault. I think that’s important to understand. And honestly I always try to make sure the person gets the sale price if it doesn’t pop up automatically and it’s only been one unfortunate time I forgot about it and it turned into a big issue once the customer read the receipt.   Generally saving you money is in the interest of anyone working in retail because if you leave happy you’re more likely to come back and spend more money with us. If you leave upset I’m pretty sure I won’t get your business again.

r3ttns,hmfefwn,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,Bobzyouruncle,11/28/2021,1.0,I don’t know about them being legally obligated to sell it to you for that price. However this is why you’ll often see  sales price tags with end dates on them. If they leave a price tag out after the sale they can simply point to the sale through date to avoid a customer service issue.  Perhaps you could legally force them to sell it to you for an advertised price that was not attached to an end date but good luck getting them to do it in the store. And it’s generally not something worth a lawsuit.

You may also feel uncomfortable bothering someone else in order to see how you should handle this situation. Chances are he wanted you to pay and leave and not have to face any of his discomforts with the situation.  In my personal experience the business itself is the one that takes the hit and not any parties involved.

r3ttns,hmdx9tf,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,ajg6882,11/28/2021,6.0,Ive worked retail for 23 years. This happens all the time: an old tag left up wrong information on the tag etc. Stores that are worth shopping at will honor the marked price unless there is a very specific barrier for doing so. Even then theres always a higher-up that can authorize it or make it right in some way.  Many times this has happened to me as a salesman Ill have a sale where the wrong price is displayed. My usual line is We messed up - if you want it you can have it at that price as I throw the old tag in the garbage. Thankfully we use digital tags now and this hardly ever happens.  It probably wasnt dishonest but it should never have been a question to give you the marked price. That salesman absolutely lost (part of) his commission on the sale though.
r3ttns,hme1fr9,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,myonlinepersonality,11/28/2021,20.0,a price tag is an invitation to treat.  Its not a formal offer to sell.  They absolutely can go back on the transaction until youve paid (consideration)
r3ttns,hme9u8k,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,atomic081,11/28/2021,1.0,Maybe.   I had a similar thing happen but I think it was no scam. I was 22 and had bought my first house. I wanted a nice leather couch set. I had found one at a local furniture chain for 7200.  That was more than I was willing to spend but kept coming back to this couch as I didn’t like anything else. 2 months later I’m in a neighboring city with time to spare and see this same chain. The couch set I wanted had a tag for 2400.   The salesman told me it was marked wrong but they would honor it if I purchased at that point. If I walked out they wouldn’t honor it anymore.  I couldn’t write that check fast enough. I still have that couch 18 years later!

r3ttns,hmedfgv,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,jerryeight,11/28/2021,1.0,Yeah absolutely depends on everyones specific plans.   If you already have a lot of money and real estate and cars then definitely maximize those 0% loans. Put that money into index funds and maybe some potentially lucrative stocks/options. 2 months before the promo ends sell enough to payoff the loans and capital gains taxes and let the rest ride. 😀

r3ttns,hmfe1ew,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,WhatsPotato,11/28/2021,1.0,I work with automotive ICs particularly their long term reliability. The saleswoman at Honda tried telling me that the electronics in a car have the same reliability standards as a regular consumer phone and would likely fail within two years so I should get the warranty. They will just straight up lie to you to make a sale  The spec for automotive is way more stringent than for consumer electronics if anyone has doubts. There is way more testing and QA that goes into anything automotive

r3vt2b,hmffz92,What are the financial benefits of marriage?,Agling,11/28/2021,1.0,From an income tax perspective being married is frequently helpful as you can file jointly. This is most valuable if one person earns a lot more than the other. However if both are high earners it can actually be harmful to file jointly so this is not 100%.  There are other potential advantages: doubling IRA contributions health insurance lower misc insurance rates (like auto insurance) sharing deductions. Again most valuable (to both) when one spouse earns a lot more than the other.  These issues are compared with living together. If you compare with being single there are tons of financial advantages to being married.
r3vt2b,hmdn3uo,What are the financial benefits of marriage?,skynetempire,11/28/2021,3.0,401k/pension you can put anyone. Marriage forces the spouse to be on there. Health insurance allow for domestic partnership. Same for HSA. Inheritance should be planned regardless since anyone can fight it. Imo marriage is good for taxes everything else can be solved with paperwork.

r3ywdd,hmdps3s,I have great credit but don't want to buy things... Can I make it useful somehow still?,EfficientRevolution,11/28/2021,7.0,A credit score is not an asset - its the lack of a barrier. A good credit score gives you full access to the best rates/terms for things like credit insurance employment etc. A bad credit score puts up a wall when trying to access those things and you have to do something to get over it like paying a higher rate borrowing a smaller amount relative to your income. If its bad enough you might not be able to get over the wall some jobs are impossible to qualify for if you have very bad credit and a lot of outstanding past due debt.      Theres no good reason to build a barrier for yourself - even if you think you might never need to head that direction why make it harder on the off chance you do? Maintain your score as you have been keep your interest paid as low as possible and know that it wont get in your way.

r3y7x2,hmdnqfa,Should I close my ROTH IRA since I have been losing more money than gaining?,Pass_Little,11/28/2021,4.0,I think youre misreading the chart and misunderstanding how this works.  As of today youve gained $144.   If you would have looked at it a couple weeks ago you would have been up $400.   The stock market goes up and down but over the long term (like years not months) goes up.  But even if you just use the $144 you earned as of right now this is equivalent to a gain of 2.4%.   Over a year this would have been close to 5%.       Long-term you can expect the market to return (inflation adjusted) around 6%.   You can also think of it this way:  without adding any additional money as a rule of thumb your money will double every 10 years.   So you should have $12K in 10 years and $24K in 20 years and $48K in 30 years without adding another dime.  And because its in a Roth its all tax-free at retirement.  So no please dont close the Roth.   Youll thank yourself at retirement.   And keep contributing $6K per year to it as long as you are permitted to do so.  If you think about it this way: if you contribute $6K per year for the next 30 years and invest similarly to how youre invested today the Roth IRA should have around $617K inflation-adjusted dollars in it.   Of which you would have only contributed $180K to it.    So by contributing $6K per year ($180K total) you earn $437K in growth without having to do anything other than contribute.  And youve done pretty well with your fund choices.   I personally would have probably just chosen FZROX and FZILX in a 60/40 ratio.   Or perhaps the non-zero versions of FSKAX and FTIHX.   Note that FZROX has all of the stocks in FZIPX so FZIPX is probably redundant and could be traded for FZROX.

r3y7x2,hmdipoz,Should I close my ROTH IRA since I have been losing more money than gaining?,Rebel-Jedi,11/28/2021,4.0,NO!!! Roth IRA will provide you with tax free income in your retirement years. You want to invest long term and max out your contributions every year. Think things like ETFs are good and they hedge with diversity. A 401k additionally is great but unlike with Roth accounts that will be taxable income.  Index funds and REITs might be good for you too. Get a library card and borrow ebooks on investing for retirement etc it’s free in most states :)  It’s long term plays the market fluctuates invest and keep investing don’t worry about it for a few years :)

If you pulled out a regular savings does nothing against inflation. Your index funds will not go to 0 consider the market on sale for the short term.

r3zk78,hmdoocj,Does a duplex really make sense?,Valence00,11/28/2021,1.0,A duplex would be a good choice because it offload a portion of your expense while separating from your tenant.   But this also falls into aesthetic as well like for example is one house in the front and one in back? or is it a side to side?  Front and back is the better choice because Youll live in the front while hiding your tenants in the back.
r3zk78,hmdp06o,Does a duplex really make sense?,EfficientRevolution,11/28/2021,5.0,It can make sense if you are willing to do the work of being a landlord in exchange for the rent you can collect. Another factor to consider is whether you are prepared to weather the risks of being a landlord - someone who bought and rented out a duplex in February 2020 might have gone without rent since March or April and only recently gotten back a severely damaged unit. Thats basically the worst case scenario but its certainly possible.      >how long are you realistically looking at before you can re-finance and go buy a house to live in?      What needs to happen for you to be able to go buy a house for you to live in? Are you going to be using the paid equity and appreciation from the duplex as a down payment? You can estimate that by looking at how the loan amortization and market conditions but you wont be able to get an exact answer.      If your goal is to be in a house or condo ASAP then buying a duplex probably doesnt make sense and youve got a different question of whether you want to buy a house in your current location or consider other options that dont involve a $4-5k mortgage.

We are fine with working on the house the landlord aspects but financially how long are you realistically looking at before you can re-finance and go buy a house to live in?  Not sure why the calculus necessarily includes a refinance.  You can lock in a very low rate now on the duplex and then save the rent proceeds for another purchase later on.  Treat the duplex like renting a room in your house except its a wholly separate unit so you dont have to worry as much about security and privacy.  >Thanks for any advice we are just lost and the housing market here everyone knows is crazy but is just crushing at times.

r3zk78,hmdukd3,Does a duplex really make sense?,never_reddit_sober,11/28/2021,9.0,Im getting starter home vibes with a twist. A home is a home first investment second. Does the duplex meet your needs better than current rental? Would it accelerate your plans to purchase a different home or slow you down? Gotta run the numbers factor in costs. Being a one property landlord isnt super profitable right away unless you get the place for a steal.     Making it by buying a home is a fucking myth. Rent max out your retirement accounts and have a taxable brokerage. When you are sick of SF buy a house somewhere else with your liquidated assets.     If youre that desperate to own a home now I say move.

r3ywdd,r3ywdd,I have great credit but don't want to buy things... Can I make it useful somehow still?,mythosopher,11/28/2021,7.0,I have a credit score of 795. Primarily because I have an absurd (\~$250k) amount of student loan debt and Ive never made a single payment for anything late. Though its whack because the balance is higher than when I first took out loans because Im on IBR and going for PSLF ($200k of that debt is federal loans) so I dont know how I have such a good credit score when the loan balance to max credit is so out of sync.  (Its also weird because while I made ok money once you take out my higher cost of living for my city and my student loan payments my budget is fairly tight with most of my luxury expenses being in my food budget for high quality groceries and some take out.)   Anyways I have no desire to do the traditional consumer things that I need credit for.   * I dont really want to buy a house or condo at least not in the current state of my life I think I prefer to rent until at least my student loans are paid off or forgiven through PSLF or I get married. I want stronger financial stability before I lock myself into another hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars investment.  * I dont have a car because I dont really need one especially during a pandemic when theres nowhere to go. It also doesnt really fit in my budget.  * I have no ideas for a business or start up or anything like that. Nor would I want the financial instability and risk that goes with it.  * I have already tried refinancing what private debt I have but I have about as low of APR as Im going to get.   So like... is there a way to make this credit score do something useful for me? It feels like its an asset that Im not using right/well.

The problem is that I must have picked the wrong stocks because in the past 5 months I have lost more money than I have gained and what little I gained I could of gotten just by working overtime at my job making it not really worth it (If that makes sense). So I am thinking of just taking the hit and lesson learned to not invest and closing my Roth early and putting it back into my savings account. Still I figured it might be a good idea to have others take a look and see just how bad my ROTH is and see if it is either somewhat repairable or just a quit while it is not to bad scenario.

r3xokx,hmey1ql,Cost of Living & Salaries; Something to Consider,MarcableFluke,11/28/2021,3.0,Bigger cities may have better public transportation options potentially even eliminating the need for a car and the costs.  People moving to a higher cost of living area may opt to rent with a roommate because splitting a 2 bedroom is much cheaper than getting your own place. To some people having a roommate isnt worth any cost. To others its not a big deal.
r3xokx,r3xokx,Cost of Living & Salaries; Something to Consider,xdivinex22,11/28/2021,3.0,We throw around the phrase cost of living and salaries but we dont really break down how significant it can be. Basically cost of living in a nutshell all comes down to what you would pay for rent or mortgage for a comparable place in each city or state. I understand there are other factors but this is the biggest factor in the discussion of cost of living comparisons. We also dont talk about how much taxes are taken out when looking at our post-tax income when we throw around salary numbers & what that actually looks like in a progressive tax system.  I always believe things are best illustrated with examples. Ill take the median 1BR in each city in these examples in order to be fair and consistent. This information Im getting is from this article released just 6 days ago listing citites and their median 1BR rents: [https://www.zumper.com/blog/rental-price-data/](https://www.zumper.com/blog/rental-price-data/)  In my Midwest part of the country in a mid-size city in a 1BR Rent averages to $620/month. Well call it Rustbelt USA. This is in a pretty decent area with a good amount of shopping restaurants good schools safe ect. Not as much jobs and the jobs that are here do pay lower. Sure thats true. Lets convert that a year to make things easier to follow because were going to be talking yearly income so (620 x 12 = $7740). So $620 monthly $7740 year. Ill be using this as an example in this post & its referred to us Rustbelt USA.  Straight from the data current 1BR rents in each city listed. I included high populated cities in various regions of the country:  NYC: $3180 monthly $38160 year  DC: $2210 monthly $26520 year  Miami: $2170 monthly $26040 year  Scottsdale AZ $1780 monthly $21360  Atlanta: $1680 monthly $20160 year  Chicago: $1520 monthly $18240 year  Dallas: $1440 monthly $17280  \--  \*\*Rustbelt USA $620 monthly $7740 year  Cost of living in terms of income I would need to make... just off rents alone.. 30k+ more to justify moving to NYC 187k+ more to justify moving to DC 18.3k+ more to consider moving to Miami 13.6k+ more to consider moving to Scottsdale 12.4k to Atlanta 10.5k to Chicago 9.5k to Dallas.  Oh wait theres more. This is all in terms of *post-tax* income. We pay for rents with our post-tax income lets not forget.  Because of the progressive tax system in the USA when I increasingly make a much higher income the more Uncle Sam comes and takes your money away. Its hard to quantify the difference for the reason being its progressive but Ill illustrate in increments of 10k.  30k = 24.5k post tax income  40k = 31.9k post tax income  50k = 39.2k post tax income  60k = 45.9k post tax income  70k = 52.3k post tax income  80k = 58.7k post tax income  So.. lets say youre making 40k in Rustbelt USA and you get an offer for a job making 60k in a different city. Youre going to be bringing home actually only 14k post-tax more. In your Rustbelt USA city youre currently spending $7.7k a year on rent. Going from 40k income to 60k seems like a *huge* jump! Lets look at the data. I still would be better off financially making just 40k in my little Rustbelt USA town than making 60k in NYC DC Miami and would net maybe a few thousand if I accepted 60k/year job in Scottsdale Atlanta Chicago or Dallas.  Ready for something *really* crazy? Making 30k a year in Rustbelt USA and accepting a 60k a year offer in Atlanta would only net 8.6k more per year when considering cost of living & the tax implications that come with that higher salary. Look at the data I posted & do the math yourself.  Just something to think about when people on here are throwing out their salary numbers or if youre someone like me that cant fathom people say theyre barely getting by on 60k a year. Well its probably because of cost of living. Us in flyover country exist and when we see numbers like a 40k/year salary posted on Reddit to us its the equivalent of 60k.
r3xokx,hme7bf6,Cost of Living & Salaries; Something to Consider,93195,11/28/2021,4.0,I agree that housing cost is probably the single biggest factor but other costs can also be too large to ignore.  Car insurance costs vary wildly by location.  In big cities parking is seldom included in rent and can add hundreds a month.  Gas costs vary widely.  $5/gal in California cities vs $3 in “Rustbelt”.  If you’re only calculating based on rent you’re missing a lot.
r3xokx,hme6cvm,Cost of Living & Salaries; Something to Consider,lordsocknose,11/28/2021,1.0,This is true to an extent but you have to account for the tremendous tax breaks you can receive if you invest in trad 401k trad IRA and HSA accounts. Other deductions like child and marriage deductions also come into account as well. Trad 401k likely helps those with higher income brackets to save more than those with lower avg gross income brackets as they can fit their upper echelons of income into a lower bracket and thus net a higher effective net income.
r3xlbc,hmde54h,Am I doing something wrong,DirtyZiplock,11/28/2021,1.0,Thank you for the nice words. I have started branching out to try new things and explore what I’m interested in potentially able to do as a career. My main and only issue living at home is dating.

r3xlbc,hmdemzg,Am I doing something wrong,7loUge,11/28/2021,1.0,I would at least as much of the loan as you can because the interest on the loan will drag out the repayment. I lived at home at about your age. I was surprised how many women I met had no problem with it. Some were even supportive and saw me as being responsible by paying off my debt while living at home. Ladies that had a problem with it really werent ones Id be interested in. Come to think of it during the period of living home I dated pretty regularly.

r3xlbc,hmddr59,Am I doing something wrong,7loUge,11/28/2021,8.0,Not sure what you mean by personal growth. You can live at home pursue interests and have friends. You can also consider what you want to do with your life career-wise while living at home. Theres little shame in it especially at a young age as yours.   Dont let living at home convince you that you cant grow as a person and dont let living at home convince you that you dont need to grow as a person. Take the time to pay down your debt and think about the future some. Thats my advice.
r3xlbc,hmdq2c3,Am I doing something wrong,EmberOnTheSea,11/28/2021,6.0,Suck it up and finish the degree and get a better paying job.  Most of us who work with people dont like people.  It is the price you pay to have a reasonable standard of living.
r3xlbc,hmdi3gk,Am I doing something wrong,Danny_ODevin,11/28/2021,6.0,With only 1 semester left finish your degree. A bachelors is a general prerequisite for many jobs that will pay better than you currently make and potentially still lead to the career you want--whether through grad school starting low level and working your way up etc. It will benefit your career the most out of all your options.  Not to mention it is a bit late in your education to be waffling on your choice of major as switching majors now will set you back in both graduation time and debt. If you decide on a different career path you can re-enroll in that program and possibly fast-track it via the credits you have already completed.  Also living at home sounds like the smart option despite the hit to your love life. It is not uncommon nowadays for children to live at home into their mid-20s and future you will be glad you took the time to save that extra money/pay down your debt. I am staring at $150K student loan myself and it definitely makes my financial decisions more challenging.

r3xlbc,r3xlbc,Am I doing something wrong,DirtyZiplock,11/28/2021,2.0,So I’m 22. Have a semester to go to complete my college degree in kinesiology but dropped out due to zero interest in a career with human performance. Have associates completed but hesitant to re-enroll into Uni if I still don’t know what career I want.  I’m currently -$55000 in debt. I am working at Amazon making $34000 yearly. I enjoy the job but know it’s not sustainable as a career.  I have $12000 saved up in investments while the student loans aren’t accumulating interest till the end of January. Living at home for only $200 per month. No car payment and only an additional $150 for phone and car insurance each month.  I know economically it makes sense to stay living at home and pay off these student loans as fast as possible but am I slowing down my personal growth by continuing to live at home? Any advice appreciated and welcome. I enjoy this sub.
r3xlbc,hmdk5g3,Am I doing something wrong,CQME,11/28/2021,5.0,>zero interest in a career with human performance.   What does this mean exactly?  >I’m currently -$55000 in debt.   This is a very expensive life lesson.  >but am I slowing down my personal growth by continuing to live at home?   No.  You are slowing down your personal growth because you dropped out of your career choice and incurred $55k in debt doing so.  You dont have a degree you can use and you dont have prospects to earn more in the work force.  Strongly suggest you reconsider whatever it is you want to do with a degree and get this fixed.  Ensure whatever you get a degree in is marketable and is something that wont incur more pointless debt in the process.
r3xlbc,hmdfi0d,Am I doing something wrong,xdivinex22,11/28/2021,5.0,I was you at 22. Eager to move out. Theres plenty of jokes & jabs out there about guys (especially guys in my opinion) living at home with their parents 21+. Felt a societal pressure to prove myself that I can be out & on my own  I nonetheless decided to wait & pile up cash and not move out till I was 25. Now Im a much richer man because of it & dont feel my growth was stunted at all. Seriously how much you can get ahead by staying at home is incredible. People wouldnt believe my net worth at 26 with only a modest income.  Im 26 now & have been out & on my own the past 6 months. Do I feel any different than when I was living at home? No not really. When I was living at home I was still working my job paying my car loan played video games & watched Netflix worked out hung out with friends on the weekend ect.  Now Im out on my own & Im *still* working my job paying my car loan playing video games & watching Netflix working out hanging out with friends on the weekend ect. Not much has changed. I do have more bills thats the biggest downfall no doubt. I do have more privacy it is more lonely and it is such easier dating for sure (not sure what your situation is there).  Long story short is no youre not slowing down your personal growth. Im on the other side of it now & I think its actually asinine that we collectively have this view that staying at home with your family is slowing personal growth.
r3xlbc,hmddmwz,Am I doing something wrong,NoSatisfaction4251,11/28/2021,19.0,Just get the degree and apply to different jobs online. You don’t need to do what you studied. A college degree is more about signalling to employers you can work consistently with deadlines.   One of the most financially successful people I know became a Wall Street Investment banker in the 1980s with a degree in Zoology from a state college in the South. If you’re that close and have the debt anyway just finish it.  Having a BA or BS will basically open any doors you want. And then just try careers that seem mildly interesting until you find one you really like. With Kinesiology every career path except basically engineering is open to you.   Even if it’s not what you want to hear or sounds lame it’s the smart thing to do if you have already paid for 90% of it.   PS: few people at your age know what they actually want to do so don’t worry about that.
r3xokx,hmf88wb,Cost of Living & Salaries; Something to Consider,shadow_chance,11/28/2021,2.0,Cost of living is obviously a thing but its also true that many people *can* make 30K more by moving to NYC. I got an offer for 40K more than I make now and free health insurance for a job in a VCHOL  Making 60K in Atlanta is still better than 30k in Rustbelt USA according to your math and the long term opportunities are almost surely better.
r3xokx,hmeefvv,Cost of Living & Salaries; Something to Consider,hellohellos,11/28/2021,1.0,i completely agree. if youre living in rustbelt USA and youre able to make the 40k-60k id say thats typically better than living in coastal cities making 60-80k from a financial perspective. and especially if you have friends/family in those areas it would be hard to move given the low cost of living. and in certain industries id recommend living in as low cost of living area as socially possible for you to maximize lifestyle and savings at those income levels.   outside of social reasons it can still make long term sense to move from rustbelt USA to new york or SF and only go from 40k to 60k and maybe even be net negative financially in the short term. the high end of salaries just go so high in those cities getting 200 300 400k is not out of the question in those coastal cities and generally those jobs are very uncommon or might not even exist in those rustbelt cities unless youre a college football coach or something.
r3xzgg,hmdljro,East coast tri-state house affordability,CQME,11/28/2021,2.0,Dont know about the RSU part.   Looking at your cash salary standard metric is debt to income around 35% is standard.  Going to spitball and say your current monthly payments are $500/month and your current cash income is around $20k/month you can probably afford easily another $7k/month in house.  This is around a $1.2mil house with a 4% mortgage tax and insurance included.  Add in your RSU income and youre probably going to comfortably afford this.  edit - hmmm...you already have a house guessing with a mortgage.  Thats important to include to figure out your current monthly obligations.  Also your cash on hand is a bit low for a purchase this size.  Probably still doable but youre likely going to have to liquidate some assets if youre comfortable with that or just save aggressively for several months.
r3y7x2,hmf8ui7,Should I close my ROTH IRA since I have been losing more money than gaining?,optimizing_pessimism,11/28/2021,1.0,I would echo others comments and definitely continue to hold onto the account! For someone just starting a Roth IRA or getting interested in investing for retirement I would recommend reading J.R.Collins “A Simple Path to Wealth”. It’s a really easy read and clearly explains what retirement vehicles are out there and what benefits they have. Also if you want a bit of an easier intro into it there’s a YouTube channel called “The Money Guy Show” which is run by two accountants and they have videos on a wide range of information related to investing and retirement accounts.

r3y7x2,hmdobt0,Should I close my ROTH IRA since I have been losing more money than gaining?,WhileNotLurking,11/28/2021,11.0,There is no wrong there. Generally time in the market beats attempting to time the market.   This is a retirement account. You likely have many years before you will need to touch it.   Reassessment of your risk tolerance is likely in order. See how much risk you are willing to take and make sure your investments are in alignment with that.   If you are young ( under 30 ) you should be super agressive. A short dip now will be washed away after decades of growth between now and your retirement.   Remember this is for the long haul. Don’t do crazy speculating In the account. Low cost index funds are your friend.

r3xzgg,hmehnj3,East coast tri-state house affordability,sideefx2320,11/28/2021,2.0,Man get yourself a great lender and you’ll have no problem with affordability. I have a similar net worth with  slightly less income. I bought a house last year after cold calling 10+ lenders quizzing them on everything. The guy I ended up working with knew every trick in the book. I’m self employed and got a conforming conventional jumbo loan at 2.89% 30yr fixed.   Pro tip: Wait to do your taxes until you’ve gotten everything on there approved by the lender.
r3xzgg,hmdsxg1,East coast tri-state house affordability,islangmemes,11/28/2021,1.0,It’s hard to say without knowing ops job details and earnings. 4% for a jumbo wouldn’t be bad. But lenders are all about risk. Op doesn’t have much net liquid net worth (not counting RSU’s or retirement funds) and still carries minor debt (student loan car loan - I would get rid of these before jumping into a new mortgage no reason not to at these earning levels). I’m sure he could probably find a lender but it probably wouldn’t be at a rate worth bragging about. It also depends on things such as the area you’re buying total cost of the loan (including real estate taxes PMI hoa etc).   I have a job that gives RSU’s as compensation and to be honest I don’t even count it as income. If I’m there long enough to reap the benefits great if not then oh well I never counted it as income to begin with. Zillow is a prime example of why you should never count RSU’s as guaranteed income. Anyone who was working for them and was part of a recent layoff just got fucked out of a lot of that compensation. If they were factoring that into overall income in loans and such they would be stretching themselves real thin. I look at RSU’s more so of an annual bonus.   If op had solid job history it probably wouldn’t be an issue. But I get the feeling this isn’t the case due to the low net worth.
r3xzgg,hmdidqn,East coast tri-state house affordability,GenroMusic,11/28/2021,0.0,Not bad at all. I believe they count student loans as income but i may be wrong so that would adjust your cost but not by much since your asset to debt ratio is weighed as it is.   I am curious what you could afford with these stats too. Im in the area and at about a third of what you have.
r3xzgg,hmds0w8,East coast tri-state house affordability,islangmemes,11/28/2021,2.0,The issue is his mortgage will definitely be categorized under a jumbo loan which definitely have stricter terms to qualify and usually also means you’ll pay higher interest rate.   OP I imagine you are somewhat recent to this income level? Reason I mention this is because your net worth doesn’t really reflect that of someone who claims to be making 450k a year and has been a high level earner for a while. Your base salary is pretty solid but are you fully aware of how RSU’s work? Usually they’re paid out over time worked at the company as incentive to keep employees employed. Most lenders will not account for this as income as it’s never guaranteed you make it to the tenured date where you receive payout. Something to consider as well.  Also if you’re new to this earning level might want to reconsider the leap to a significantly more expensive house.

So say I buy a 10k max bond each month it makes 700? As the monthly interest is 7.something%. So in a year you get from interest 8.4k?   If that is correct then is the 8.4k interest then added to the 10k =18.4k in bonds that then this year that will be interested at the 7% or is it always interested(not sure if thats the correct word) at that 10k you purchased the bond at?   And maybe some other good ways of using your spare cash to work/make money for you?

You dont want to lose those payments just because you have this settlement. The safe withdrawal rate from stocks is considered 4% per year so youd need a $250000+ settlement to exceed your disability payments.

r4143b,hme8y4w,VA Benefits and Marriage?,EWCM,11/28/2021,3.0,>Will the VA change her benefits based on my income?   Disability benefits are not reduced based on income. Her benefit would actually increase as you would be an additional dependent.  >Will any other of her benefits change (forced to use my insurance etc)?  It sounds like she would qualify for Priority 1 VA healthcare. That is unaffected by income. There are priority groups connected to income but those are for people without disability ratings or very low disability ratings.   If you add her to your insurance she is supposed to inform the VA. She can still use the VA but they will bill the insurance company to recoup the cost of covered services.  >Will I still be able to claim her as a dependant? Filing Married or Separate? (she doesnt file now)  It usually doesn’t make sense to claim a spouse as a dependent. Filing as Married Filing Jointly doubles your standard deduction and most tax brackets so that could considerably decrease your tax burden.
r4143b,hmdxmw8,VA Benefits and Marriage?,TinCanSailor987,11/28/2021,4.0,Her disability rating won’t change hence her payout won’t change. To make her feel better she should contact her state’s VA rep to verify this.

My Girlfriend of 10 years and I are planning on marrying soon but I have been hesitant because I dont know how it will affect our taxes finances and (her) VA benefits.  My GF is receiving 80% VA disabilty - this includes a monthly benefit of ~ $1900 and full medical coverage at the VA.  I make ~ $150k gross at my job with pretty decent med/dent/vision.  All of our children are grown up except for her daughter (13) who lives with the father - my GF pays $300/month in support.  Since my GF got her VA benefits she has been stay-at-home and I have claimed her as a dependant.  Our home is mine - I have owmed it for 15 years prior to meeting her - as are both vehicles - and pretty much all other assests (plus 401k pension).  We live in New Hampshire.  Will marriage change any of this?  Will the VA change her benefits based on my income?  Will any other of her benefits change (forced to use my insurance etc)?  Will I still be able to claim her as a dependant?  Filing Married or Separate? (she doesnt file now)  Will her Child Support obligation change based on my income?    Are my assests at risk if (God forbid) we divorce etc?   So many questions!  I appreciate any insight or direction.  Thank you

r40nok,hmdy9qu,Credit Card Debt,Express_Arugula387,11/28/2021,1.0,It’s crazy how accessible they make it to put yourself down $100000 in debt. I can definitely see how things could go sideways fast lol. But how efficient is point farming and what kind of benefits does someone get from that if you don’t mind me asking.
r4143b,hmfb7ec,VA Benefits and Marriage?,93195,11/28/2021,1.0,I believe that’s correct.  As non-disabled non-broke my own priority amounts to “go away”.  I learned this when I tried to get a Covid shot at the VA as they had them before commercial providers did.    The disability rating is the key.

r41udj,r41udj,Interested in learning how to use money to slowly make money,Arashi3xx,11/28/2021,0.0,Hi I am a 23f who recently became disabled from a car accident and now I am unable to work and have permanent damages that leave me unable to walk much or even get up often. I will eventually get a hopefully decently large amount from my settlement from a case against the person who hit me insurance.   I know my life is messed up now but I want to learn how to use this money from settlement to make money with it to be ok in the future. Ya a large amount of money will last awhile but it runs out when you arent making money. Yes I do get disability but it is ~800 a month and now a days this doesnt really get you far. I want to be financially stable and make good decisions with the money I get not just think ok now Im good forever cause I know its not how it is. I learned about I bonds that you get interest on so what other ways can I get interest in loaning money like bonds or investing in something? I heard of people buying land just land and then having companies pay them to use the land stuff like that? Throw out some ideas ❤️
r429vw,hme45n4,"3 different plans offered, but nearly the same?",MountainStoneMist,11/28/2021,5.0,Speak with HR or a benefits counselor. I am guessing you have a 403(b) 401(k) and a 457(b) plan. All of these plans can be similar to a 401(k) but each have their own rules and minor differences.  Your annuity might be a 403(b) and the deferred compensation plan is another name for a 457(b) plan.

For starters a 403(b) is also known as a tax-sheltered annuity. Investing in a 403(b) can be as simple as target date funds mutual funds bond funds similar to the 401k and 457b. A 403(b) can also be invested in a fixed or variable annuity which tend to have high fees and high surrender charges. Some employers let you choose between several 403(b) providers and depending on which one you choose will determine the type of investment products they offer (mutual funds fixed or variable annuity).  [https://investorjunkie.com/retirement/highest-fees-403b-accounts/](https://investorjunkie.com/retirement/highest-fees-403b-accounts/)  Side note: Some of your plans may allow Roth contributions.

r43ffe,hmer34d,Company being bought out. What happens to my ESOP?,Ameteur_Professional,11/28/2021,1.0,It depends on the specific deal this was my experience.  Whatever stock you have will be sold for an agreed price to the buying company then you will get that + any cash held on the ESOP.  You.may not get this all at once some of it may be tied up for a few years.  You can then roll this into a 401k IRA or you can take it as cash but that may have a tax penalty.  This happened to me recently and I quit shortly after the merger.  75% is being rolled into an IRA and I will get the other 25% after the IRS signs off on the whole thing (probably after 2 years)  Because the share price was much higher than what it was previously valued at my ESOP value doubled before being paid out.  I still lost some money leaving because I wasnt fully vested in the 401k.
r43ffe,r43ffe,Company being bought out. What happens to my ESOP?,fasterthendeath,11/28/2021,3.0,Hi! So essentially I work for a company and we have an employee stock option program. I am 40% vested in the ESOP but I was told I will fully vest when the deal goes through1 woohoo! My company is merging with a capital partner so i guess the ESOP has to end. My question is- will I see an additional benefit other than just fully vesting? Will I get some sort of compensation based on the multiple of our valuation since I’m technically part “owner”? Thanks!
r43ffe,hme8vlx,Company being bought out. What happens to my ESOP?,woollywhelk,11/28/2021,5.0,It depends and there is no way for us to know what will happen. Usually employee options are common stock so in an acquisition event the preferred stock holders (founders and investors) are bought out and paid first. Depending on how much debt the company has common stock may be worth something or not.

r439m3,r439m3,UK Employee pension salary contribution is post tax,ParticularOdd4773,11/28/2021,2.0,My UK current employer offers 9% pre tax employer contribution (without any matching required) and I can contribute an additional amount however it’s post tax.  At the moment I’m contributing ~40% of my post tax salary and I’m wondering whether the fact it’s post tax means it isn’t the best use of pensions benefits.  Are there better/more efficient alternatives in the UK
r439m3,hmejb6c,UK Employee pension salary contribution is post tax,disorderedmomentum,11/28/2021,1.0,UKPersonalFinance is better to ask this question. If you are paying tax on your contributions it is an error. However some schemes are set up so that tax relief is added after the contribution is made. Check if this is the case with your pension provider. If not speak to payroll at your work and explain that you should not be paying tax on this contribution. Firms do get this wrong as happened to me they were able to rectify it.

Im not an expert - but it looks like the Maxi Cosi Mura Plus car seat + stroller combo isnt currently on sale and isnt on the list of car seats compatible with the Hyundai i20.  Rather than spend on a new car - you may want to explore a new car seat + stroller combo instead.. One thats compatible with the car.  Since its just you + wife + child - a Hyundai i20 can work. Its about finding the right equipment that works with the Hyundai instead of looking at specific equipment and then trying to rework the car.

r42n9t,hme4k3c,Should I buy a new car or just a roof box?,Wandering_Lights,11/28/2021,5.0,Keep the car and make it work. The i20 isnt that small and its only one kid. Not having any ability to save while having a new kid isnt smart.
r42n9t,hme5egd,Should I buy a new car or just a roof box?,93195,11/28/2021,2.0,A 2012 Hyundai isn’t going to last forever and a roof box isn’t that convenient for everyday use and getting kid stuff in and out.  But you don’t have to spend 40K euro on a new Peugeot either at least if you don’t have high income.  What’s your income?  If it’s modest get a bigger newer car that better suits your current needs but not a 40K Peugeot either.
r42n9t,hme5s4l,Should I buy a new car or just a roof box?,93195,11/28/2021,4.0,Sell the Hyundai get a slightly newer and bigger used vehicle not the new Peugeot.  This isn’t “all or nothing”.

That apple car ur talking about is still at the very least 5-8 years away. No prototype and mass production takes everything you have (ask Elon). Even if you order a brand new Tesla today youll be waiting 2-3 years till you get it. You can get a decent 2012 car that has everything your asking for except the new shinty toy feel. Dont go into this ALL or None mentality especially with something that is designed to get you from point A to B. Never buy a brand new car from a dealer...
r42n9t,r42n9t,Should I buy a new car or just a roof box?,foadsf,11/28/2021,1.0,We have had a 2012 Hyundai i20 since the time both my wife and I were students. The car is OK. But we have become parents 7 months ago and every day it becomes more clear that [the car is too small](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/qomerh/how_to_install_maxicosi_mura_plus_on_a_car_seat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for us.  We have had our eyes on a 2021 Pegout 3008 for a while. We can afford the installments but it will for sure push us to the edges financially. Basically we will have no savings for the next 2-3 years.  On the other hand the auto industry seems quite unstable right now. Due to the chip shortage and supply chain disruptions production has been stagnated. At the same time people have been saving the money they would usually spend outside or on their vacations many now want to purchase new cars. Inflation is pushing the prices high. Classical economy demand is higher production is lower so the prices seem overvalued at the moment. Meanwhile new technologies are also racing to take over the traditional car industry. Electric cars with much more smart technologies are being introduced every day. Even Apple is aiming for the market big time. And if the solid-state batteries and technologies alike deliver the promises they are making practically buying a car right now is throwing money out. Buying a car now pretty much looks like buying a high-end Nokia in 2007 when iPhone was taking over the market.  Now my question is if I should buy a new car knowing this ~40k€ will be zero in 5-10 years. Or should I buy a roof-box for 200-500€ accepting the fact that it will affect our fuel consumption and convenience? Or maybe Im wrong and buying a car doesnt mean throwing the money away and the assumptions of overvaluation and new technologies are exaggerated? I would appreciate it if you could share your thoughts helping me make an educated decision.
r42n9t,hmejfn0,Should I buy a new car or just a roof box?,invenio78,11/28/2021,2.0,This.  They can fit a kid into the i20 (actually two without any problem).  If they want a new car they should save up and when they have the cash pay for it out of pocket.  The new car is not a necessity its a luxury purchase.  Luxury purchases should never cause you to go into debt.
r429vw,r429vw,"3 different plans offered, but nearly the same?",interestingnotcrazy,11/28/2021,1.0,My employer has 3 different plans set up for me and I’m curious if the 2 plans are pretty much the same as a 401k.  I have an annuity plan that they take a portion of my check and it goes into that.  I have a retirement plan that they also take a portion of my check and it goes into that.  And then I have a regular “deferred compensation” plan.   So I’m curious if all of these plans are essentially the same as the deferred compensation 401k. As in that the money that goes towards these plans will compound the same as a 401k or similar?   Any thoughts would be appreciated thank you :)

But so if they have hit a certain credit score then they will be approved for a higher credit limit then what they can make a deposit for? Like $500 deposit for $500 limit but instead $500 for $5000 limit?
r40nok,hmdxt7u,Credit Card Debt,9percentmilk,11/28/2021,3.0,There is not deposit required for unsecured credit cards. I have 5-6 of them for point farming purposes and my total credit limit is something like $75k. Of course I would never utilize that all at once but theoretically I could and all I had to do was fill out some forms online to open the accounts. This is how irresponsible people can get into a lot of trouble with credit cards.
r40nok,hmecaae,Credit Card Debt,j-christopher,11/28/2021,-1.0,Your scenario assumes that something bad happens to someone whos completely unprepared for the unexpected which is an awful way to go through life.  This is what liquid savings is for.  The credit card is a backup.  Overdraft fees are also entirely voluntary.  Its completely irrational to pay a bill with money you know isnt there and then expect there to be no consequences.

You’re only going to hit that million that much quicker.   However the annual contribution limit for a Roth IRA is $6000 which is $500 a month.

r3zr93,hme3xwr,How much to invest as a teen with no living costs?,NoMoLerking,11/28/2021,2.0,I think that’s the right answer. As you earn more you can save more but if you’re maxing out a Roth as a teen I think you’re in good shape.    I guess I just know people on both side of too much.

You have until April 15 2022 do make a Roth contribution for 2021.  If your MAGI is too high you can consider doing a back door Roth instead (theres a small amount of extra paperwork required at tax time for this but a bigger caveat is that it gets complicated if you currently hold any deductible traditional IRAs). You could also consider not waiting and doing the backdoor Roth now.

r40nok,hmdz4dc,Credit Card Debt,9percentmilk,11/28/2021,2.0,Well the benefits are that you get things like hotels/flights/cash back for free by spending money you were going to spend anyway. But I’ll be honest trying to really micromanage it is probably more effort than it’s worth for most people. I usually recommend people get one decent card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred and then just not think about it too much. The trouble is that people often spend *more* money on their cards than they otherwise would because they start chasing point goals which defeats the entire purpose.

I have a $1500 credit line between the 2. I just don’t understand how people can throw themselves into $5000/$10000+ debt from using them? Also when you have a credit card of that size do you need to put that same amount as a deposit? If so why don’t people just use the initial deposit and pay off their debt?
r40nok,hmdu2rk,Credit Card Debt,Buggy3D,11/28/2021,4.0,If you build enough of a credit score you can get credit cards that can pull out way more than that.   I was able to get a $16500 credit limit card when I was 27.  Having a bigger spending limit allows you to borrow more in case of a rainy day but it also allows you rake in more points so long as you can make your payments back.  You can also buy bigger and more expensive things right away without the need to get “approved” first.   In a sense it’s basically a bigger amount of pre-approved debt.

I grew up poor and my parents weren’t able to teach me any degree of personal finance.

Phone/internet bill? Do you have a kid? Medical bills? How has covid affected your income? Bills don’t care.  You have two secured credit cards with $1500 each.  Let’s say your car needs a new transmission that’s $1800 alone. One of your cards doesn’t cover the cost and is now maxed out. It’s $300 for the install your at $2100. Shop has to wait for it to arrive three weeks later. So you have no car because you never opted for it on the insurance.   Let’s say it costs you $100 a week to get to and from work via ride share. You’re at $2500 of $3k. Car is still in the shop and you still have to make payments on it including insurance and all other bills let’s say $600. You’re now at $3100 and I’m debt by $100.   Now here comes the overdraft fee and monthly bill which charges you based on amount owed. You’re now at $4k in credit card bills.   But wait there’s more.  COVID! Nobody works for 4 months and you can’t pay bills credit card company doesn’t care. Your getting charged interest on the interest.  Get it now?
r40nok,hme9ihl,Credit Card Debt,Illustrious-Ease974,11/28/2021,1.0,At 24 had about $1200 in credit card debt.  I absolutely felt suffocated by it and wondered how people rack up so much.  Now at 30 Ive had a moment in time with $14000 in credit card debt.  We had a series of unfortunate events after buying a house and didnt have the emergency funds.  Luckily we paid most of it off in the past year.  I know people who have $50000+ in credit card debt. That still blows my mind but I havent experienced events in life they have and hope not to.  Ive had a $20000 limit since 25.

r40nok,hmdu0ot,Credit Card Debt,EfficientRevolution,11/28/2021,8.0,You get yourself $5-10k into debt by having $5-10k in credit available and using all of it. Some people make poor choices like going on a vacation and promising themselves theyll spend less over the next year and then they dont. Others lose a job experience a medical issue etc. and use credit cards to make up the difference. There are many reasons some you control others you dont have a lot of control over why a person can wind up in debt.      Most credit cards do not require deposits. Secured cards are a tool for people with limited or bad credit history to build positive history after they do that they can qualify for unsecured cards.
r405w8,r405w8,I don't want to throw my money away renting. Is this viable?,hungry-hypocrite,11/28/2021,0.0,Hi Im a Spanish guy in his mid 20s who wants to finally move and become independent. Ive been working for a few years so Ive got some savings with me.  Right now I could afford 20-30% of the total price of a decent flat. The thing is buying a flat is something you really have to think about and for months Ive been in this analysis-paralysis kind of situation.  A mortgage at my age is a big commitment but I could afford it well since Im comfortable with my income. Investing in my own home sounds like what I should be doing if I want to make good use of my money.  I dont know what to do with my life. I live in a small city which I love and if I bought a flat heres where Id like to buy it. But I dont know if Im going to live here forever. Maybe in the future Ill want to move to the capital or even go somewhere else in Europe.  So Im torn because buying a flat means commiting to living somewhere. Also if I am buying a flat Id want it to be something decent not one of these 60 year old buildings that have lots of maintenance costs.  This brings me to my plan. What if I bought a flat I liked like if I was going to live there and 2 years after that I decided to move to another place?   - Is renting difficult? Would I be able to earn enough money renting my flat to payout my mortgage monthly? (or even have minor losses)  - Would I want to contact an agency that takes care of renting my flat? To be honest it sounds like an okay idea to me its less stressful.  - What price and characteristics should I look for when it comes to buying an apartment that is also a good option for rental?  Id appreciate it if you could guide me a little. Thanks
r405w8,hme927x,I don't want to throw my money away renting. Is this viable?,jsboutin,11/28/2021,6.0,Renting isnt throwing away money. Its buying shelter. You also throw away plenty of money buying a home.  Im not in Spain but heres how Id think about it.  - what do comparable places rent for? Assume you can rent it at this price then see if it covers the mortgage and any taxes attached to it.  -How far away from  Madrid are you? Is it a convenient drive or a big pain to do it? Because if you want to rent it you will sometimes have to go check the place out for maintenance or to find a new tenant.  - If you want to rent it out look for middle-of-the-road finishes and quality with durable materials. Depending on the market proximity to transit is often important.  -look out for protections for tenants and landlords in the law. Does Spanish law usually side with the renter? What would happen if a tenant stopped paying? Are you willing to live with that sort of a burden?
r405w8,hmflzac,I don't want to throw my money away renting. Is this viable?,2xOPisANidiot,11/28/2021,1.0,As others have suggested renting can be the better financial option. No closing costs cheaper insurance/utilities no maintenance costs no property tax no throwing money away on loan interest. You also often pay for the exact size you need vs a bunch of unused space when owning.  In your situation you should rent. You can think about ownership when you can confidently say this is where I want to live for at least the next 6-10 years.
r405w8,hmenlbe,I don't want to throw my money away renting. Is this viable?,decaturbob,11/28/2021,2.0, - never assume that renting is always throwing money away and in many scenarios. its way smarter than buying

In between the time that you made that post and this one I was able to learn more about soft inquiries and how to request a Consumer Inquiry which answered all of my questions!  I didnt know that soft inquiries were even a thing.  As far as for what the lending was for I can unfortunately let you know that some were benign and the others were.. not.  The first one was not as well.  In any case you had no reason to share your knowledge with me other than to help someone out.  Im quite grateful.  Small stuff helps.
r3zs3v,hmdrv1b,"Short term loan(s?) opened in my name by spouse, do not show up on credit report, how can I tell if the others are in my name",Pass_Little,11/28/2021,3.0,Youll need to get a credit report which includes soft inquiries.  On your credit report you have two types of inquiries one is the hard inquiries which is what you see when you apply for a credit card or bank loan.  The soft inquiries are what these companies use.   They dont affect your credit score and dont appear as a hard inquiry on your report.   However the credit bureaus do keep track of them.  It used to be when you ordered a credit report they were listed.  However I havent seen any on any of the reports Ive seen recently.  A google search also didnt turn up any hard hits on how to get a report with this data.  You may want to reach out to one or more of the credit bureaus to see if you can get your own report with that data attached.  As far as lenders go the ones you mentioned seem rather benign.   That is they almost all fall into the buy something and split the payment into 4 payments with no interest type of lenders which I could see me using if I needed something that I couldnt afford right this second but did have the budget for over the next couple of months.     They arent really open-ended credit products but instead sort of halfway between paying cash and having a revolving store card.
r3zs3v,r3zs3v,"Short term loan(s?) opened in my name by spouse, do not show up on credit report, how can I tell if the others are in my name",throwaway-wtfloans,11/28/2021,5.0,I recently found out via snailmail that my spouse had originated a short term loan (415$) without my permission or knowledge through Klarna.  Its only in my name not theirs or joint.  They have access to **all** of my personally identifiable info.    &#x200B  I would never have found out about this loan had the physical mail not arrived.  Klarna is apparently a short-term loan lender with the main selling point being that they dont hard-check your credit account.  I regularly check said report myself so I think that this was obviously a factor in the choice of lender.  &#x200B  I honestly dont check our bank statements for unexpected activities that often because were married.  When I did check them after getting this mail I found the following short term lenders: Sezzle Affirm Afterpay Dave PayIn4 among others.  &#x200B  Im not looking for relationship advice here.  I just need to know if there is a way to find out (since **one** was absolutely opened in my name) if the others were too.  The rest dont show up on my credit report (but neither did the first which Im now sure of).  Trying to google this just spits me out at the websites of these short-term lenders touting how great their services are.  I can find no way to check this information short of asking my spouse to surrender their phone and insert passwords which at the moment isnt an option.  &#x200B  Is there a way to run any kind of check of short-term non-credit-check-visible lenders like these unilaterally without opening the proprietary apps of those lenders?  &#x200B  Thanks if you can help!

Never answered them I knew it was bullshit. Absolutely do not entertain this at all. Theyre groveling and begging for you/her to be stupid enough to pay them her rightful money earned.

She could be an independent contractor but OP says employment contract and is speaking like its an employment relationship in the comments so Id wager she was an employee and required at least minimum wage.

There are some (see: very few) claw-backs on guaranteed commission ramps for the first few months/quarters. But never anywhere near the total base salary. If they only paid her base and are now asking for it back its absolute horseshit.  If youre paying someone ~$70k a year theres no company in the world that would reasonably expect a short term employee to be able to pay back $56k.

r3w211,hmdk52l,my bro went to ER for appendicitis- insurance denying stay,pharmerK,11/28/2021,0.0,He was probably denied because the documentation of his condition didn’t justify the coding that was submitted for the type/severity of his stay. Give their patient financial services team a call and ask them to have the coding team evaluate his documentation and claims coding. He should have been either “observation” or “outpatient care in a bed” not “inpatient.” The hospital can also appeal this on his behalf (and they may be doing so already).
r3w211,hmdmma4,my bro went to ER for appendicitis- insurance denying stay,TheNovac,11/28/2021,1.0,To figure out the problem: Log into his health insurance portal and/or call the insurance company and request the EOB (Explanation of Benefits) for the claim. This will typically include an explanation as to why the claim was denied (prior authorization required lack of information etc.) You can use this information to address the denial reason and begin an appeal.  *Possibilities: Since he didnt receive surgery his insurance didnt recognize the event as an emergency requiring him to be admitted to the hospital. Most if not all plans require prior authorization for certain higher-cost treatments. This is usually waived for a short time period when admitted to a hospital for an emergency however you need to contact your insurance company to notify them of the emergency usually within 48 hours. Sometimes if youre at an out-of-network hospital you may need to be moved to a different hospital or receive additional authorization. If they werent notified they might have viewed it as a failure to obtain authorization.*

r3vzls,hmdeh6n,First time buying a used car. Dealership is pricing the car decently over market value. How to start negotiations?,i_am_viet,11/28/2021,2.0,Like I said go ahead and use KBB to negotiate with. Let’s see how far OP will accomplish with it.  Car dealerships are looking to maximize their profits. They operate with today’s market demand. Their competition is that dealership across the street. And if the competitor is about to realize a sale with plenty of meat on the bone then they’ll do what they can to capture the sale instead. Usually that involves giving up a small piece of the meat. One of the large costs of a dealership is attracting serious buyers.  KBB and other individual value based resources are just that a resource to get an understanding of the market. It is not a strong leverage tool in a negotiation. When you negotiate you don’t point to an average number and say “but people got it at that price!”. You negotiate with showing a real quote from a competitor and being serious about following through with accepting it.  If you want to use an actual dealership value resource then look at Black Book. This is the resource they use when they come up with their prices. But even then this isn’t leverage material.  The population over at r/askcarsales will have a different viewpoint from yours.
r3vzls,hmdttwg,First time buying a used car. Dealership is pricing the car decently over market value. How to start negotiations?,islangmemes,11/28/2021,2.0,So a few things to note here OP. The car market right now is insane and it’s 100% a sellers market. Dealerships are pricing cars way above market value because they can…. And why would they drop the price and negotiate with you when someone else would be willing to pay the inflated price? Unfortunately that’s the situation we’re in. I was helping my girlfriend find a new car and it’s a fucking mad house out there right now. Everything that was remotely decent price was being bought sight unseen. A listing would go up and the car would be gone by the time she got there. The only other cars left to be grabbed were over priced or not good quality.   All I can recommend is have great patience. It’s going to be frustrating but don’t settle.  Eventually you will find something that is a fair deal.

Go ahead and show these numbers to the dealership you are negotiating with. I am sure they’ll give you the car at the price listed on KBB. Sounds like KBB is all the leverage you need to get the price you want.

Its a maybe at best and will change every year?~~  Edit - What I missed is that due to the tax rates working marginally and everything doubling when filing jointly more of the higher earners income receives the lower tax rate before it jumps up into the higher bracket so the result is a lower tax when filing jointly.  Reducing high tax rates has a greater impact on the numbers than increasing low tax rates

r3vt2b,hmf0rxh,What are the financial benefits of marriage?,Vidyogamasta,11/28/2021,2.0,Instead of 2 individually bracketed individuals theyre counted as one income stream but the brackets are doubled in size.   So lets imagine fictional world with tax brackets every 25k increasing by 10% each time. So 0-25k is 0% 25-50k is 10% etc.   Take an extreme example like a single worker making 100k and a non-working spouse. With no marriage the non-working partner pays 0% and the working partner pays 15%* of the 100k. With a marriage their joint income stream is taxed for 5%* of the 100k.   This particular advantage is basically removed entirely if both spouses work at similar income levels. If both people made 100k instead the total tax would be 15% of their 200k* which is the same as if they each would have filed separately.  \* The math: four 25k brackets with progressively increased tax is 0%\*25k + 10%\*25k + 20%\*25k + 30%\*25k. 0 + 2500 + 5000 + 7500 = 15000 or 15% of 100k. The married example instead has two 50k brackets progressively increasing so 0%\*50k + 10%\*50k or 5k total. And finally the 200k example same as above but add 20%\*50k + 30%\*50k to get 5000 + 10000 + 15000 = 30k which is 15% of 200k.

As an anecdote I would not have qualified for the second round of stimulus checks if I was filing separately because my income was too high. My wife does not make as much as I do so our joint income was within the threshold to qualify for the full stimulus check. It is important to run both scenarios because it depends.

r3vzls,hmee553,First time buying a used car. Dealership is pricing the car decently over market value. How to start negotiations?,fabulousfred,11/28/2021,1.0,Dont buy this car without starting it and letting it get hot.  All cars sound different cold and allowing the vehicle to warm completely will reveal its flaws.  Noisy engine smoke slipping transmission leaks failing AC -- all of these problems are masked by a cold condition.   Once its nice and hot roll down the windows turn off the air and radio and try driving/turning a very tight circle both to the left and right all while listening to the front.  There should be very little squealing and no tick-tick sounds (CV joints).   Finally after your road test let the car sit and idle for another 20 minutes.  Look at the tailpipe for smoke check the AC for at least a 20 degree split in temperature (if its 90 outside the AC should blow around 70 degrees).  Lift the hood and look.  Is the engine smoking?  Is it making unusual sounds?  If all of this is too much for you ask a mechanic to check the vehicle for you.  Better to know the flaws BEFORE you negotiate price.  Have fun with all that!

r3w1gb,hmed0j6,How to Find the Best Mortgage,j-christopher,11/28/2021,1.0,>how do I go about finding a lender? Do I just apply to as many places as I can and compare who gives me the best terms?  Basically although you dont have to apply to get a quote.  The most important thing to understand in order compare mortgage offers is how to determine the total cost (upfront fees plus all of the interest youll pay over X years where X is the the amount of time you intend to keep the mortgage (before selling the home refinancing again or otherwise paying it off).  Dont get lured in by no closing costs! or nothing out of pocket! until youve calculated the impact of the higher rate interest rate you must accept in exchange for this benefit.  It costs *the lender* somewhere around $8000-9000 to originate a mortgage.  They arent going to do yours for free.
r3w1gb,hmdn99c,How to Find the Best Mortgage,CQME,11/28/2021,1.0,>Firstly when do I search for a lender for a mortgage? Right now?  Yep now is fine first step in the homebuying process is to determine if you need a mortgage.  If you need a mortgage get pre-approved first before house hunting.  This will give you a ballpark as to how much of a house you can afford so you dont go around looking at pie-in-the-sky mansions no one will finance for you.  >how do I go about finding a lender? Do I just apply to as many places as I can and compare who gives me the best terms?  You can go on the web and research rates.  IMHO theres not much difference between lenders except for the rates they offer.  Go with prime lenders first if you have the credit for it (assuming you do)...prime lenders are basically banks.  Some online institutions have less overhead and can offer even lower rates.  Typically what a lot of institutions do is that once they fund your mortgage they immediately sell your mortgage to Wall Street so that they get the funds back to fund another mortgage rinse and repeat.  Do your research...ensure you know what a prepayment penalty is what points are what closing costs are the difference between rate and APR etc etc  i.e. the nuts and bolts of a mortgage.  >Do I just apply to as many places as I can and compare who gives me the best terms?  Yep this is called shopping around sounds like you know how it works.  =)  >Lastly I heard some banks will give .25 or .50 percent reductions on mortgages to people who have money in accounts with the bank for a few months. Could these give the best rates? It can’t be too hard to just open an account and transfer money for a few months right?  Banks might offer discounts for a myriad number of reasons.  Just shop around.

You will be looking for a house in a specific range because you should figure out what monthly mortgage payment fits your budget.  You want to get preapproved for the top of that range. The preapproval says this is the most money we will lend you not this is the exact amount we will lend you.

If you did your homework the dealer will usually respect your position and work with your numbers.  It cuts out a lot of unnecessary bullshit because like any salesman the dealer is looking to maximize their profit/commission and they have the best opportunity to do so with customers who have no idea what they are doing on that lot.  They will upsell those customers like you wouldnt believe (this is a general life tip BTW).  That being said Im sure you know its a sellers market right now.

How to start negotiations?,Stable-McCafe,11/28/2021,2.0,Look at some 2014-16 Toyotas and Hondas on Carvana. It should be around the price you want. I dont think a 80k miles Corolla or Civic will perform any less than a 2018 Hyundai Accent. You might be even pleasantly surprised. One of the reasons for a highest price by the dealers is because the manufacturers warranty is probably still active on the Hyundai for couple of more thousand miles.  I think the best way around negotiating these days (with a messed up market) is to get a car in your budget even if its a tiny bit older model than you wanted. Just really not the best time for cars. Costco has a used car buying service for its members. Maybe other chains might have similar services you can check. There supposed to be no haggle prices.  P.S. Toyota just announced that theyll be starting up production again..so maybe the chip shortage will slowly stop affecting the market after a while. If you can hold out a little longer to buy you could do that but doesnt necessarily mean youd be guaranteed a better deal.  https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/toyota-production-back-track-december-after-chip-related-cutbacks

r3w7qb,hmdf7wh,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,ThatITguy2015,11/28/2021,67.0,Hopefully you can name and shame so others don’t end up falling for it. This is beyond scummy. I’m kinda hoping they get the shit sued out of them if it is possible.
r3w7qb,hmdhoa4,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,RonStopable08,11/28/2021,91.0,Yeah.  Here is what I would do: record every conversation and email.  Make notes and keep an accurate timeline.  File a complaint with your att. Gen. commerce dept and state labour.  I would also write one final email asking for proof that this money is owed as well as the contact information for the legal department so your lawyer can get involved.  Also request a reply by a certain date and if there is no reply by said date the matter will be considered closed.  (By saying this you will have reasonable grounds later to say “I didn’t pay because they didn’t get back to me”)  As an added measure you can consider consulting an employment lawyer (if you do this do it before sending anything else) hell maybe you could find a free consult.
r3w7qb,hmdilt1,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,6.0,Thank you for this great advice! Will weight all the wonderful input from this community then create an action plan for this moving forward

r3w7qb,hmdh0ps,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,TRauck,11/28/2021,11.0,Is this an actual thing? Companies have you sign a contract that basically says if you dont work here x amount of time then you must pay us back all the money payed at an hourly rate?

r3w7qb,hmdgrv8,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,pheonixblade9,11/28/2021,67.0,pay a lawyer $50 to send a letter stating that any future correspondence must be forwarded exclusively to the lawyer and that any further communication on the topic from the employer will be considered harassment.  worked for me to get a sketchy leasing agency off my back.
r3w7qb,hmdi3od,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,46.0,Great advice brother thank you for this.

r3w7qb,hmdf6uv,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,SkepticAquarian876,11/28/2021,2.0,She rendered her skills/time and services thus got paid. If she wasnt doing her tasks on time they would have fired her. I dont see where she owes them anything. I dont know what state or country you are in but I think you need to hit the back with a labor lawyers response.
r3w7qb,hmdc85y,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,RustySheriffsBadge1,11/28/2021,1681.0,You might also want to reply back to the HR contact asking them to “kindly point out where in the offer letter does it stipulate any pay clawback?”
r3w7qb,hmdiv02,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,Mah_Nerva,11/28/2021,433.0,Okay at a minimum she is likely covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act and it appears Texas does have some reasonable wage and hour laws. In short ask them to put in writing all reasons why they think they are entitled to return of all pay. After they reply take the issue to a labor and employment attorney and ask for a free consultation on this issue. It is highly highly likely that what your wife’s former employer is doing violates federal and state laws but you should get their “reasoning” for their request in writing first so you can verify before telling them to pound sand. Also if the attorney you consult with tells you they are as crazy as I suspect they are you don’t have to pay that attorney to write a letter on your behalf (unless they think you have a good case you want to sue them and the attorney agrees to work on a contingency fee basis) otherwise you’re wasting money on something you can write for yourself because it doesn’t have to be very detailed.
r3w7qb,hmdhfjy,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,x_driven_x,11/28/2021,2.0,Gotcha. Yeah that seems sketch.   Good luck! I think you guys will be fine but sucks to deal with.
r3w7qb,hmdeqvj,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,11.0,Yeah man the most important part of joining an organization is to see who you will be working for/alongside.
r3w7qb,hmdfeez,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,bent42,11/28/2021,29.0,Dont listen to that guy. Be 100% proactive. If the company is in the right somehow and you wait for them to pay a lawyer youre going to be on the hook for those attorneys fees.
r3w7qb,hmdcit1,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,RustySheriffsBadge1,11/28/2021,172.0,You got it! Sounds like it could be a recoverable-Draw or some sort of draw based commission
r3w7qb,hmdc400,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,Old_Ladies_Die_Hard,11/28/2021,210.0,In addition to contacting an employment attorney call your state’s labor board. Since she was a contractor they may not be able to help specifically. But depending on the state they *might* be able help. That requesting repayment of gross income may trip up this company. Either way knowing she is going to attack this aggressively might make them back off.   What reason did they give for demanding a refund of all the work she had done for a year?
r3w7qb,hmdgt3k,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,12.0,No relocation or immigration it was a remote position.
r3w7qb,hmdcozi,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,73.0,That is our plan here. Hold our ground and wait to see what they do. We’ll have a law firm in our back pocket in case it is needed
r3w7qb,hmdhms1,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,f0urtyfive,11/28/2021,152.0,I mean not a lawyer but I cant imagine any court would look fondly on an employer trying to reverse previous pay for normal hourly work... Stuff where Ive seen things like that is you could have to repay a cash bonus or something like that not just give me back your salary because minimum wage laws dont apply to us.
r3w7qb,hmdje5i,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,sfdude2222,11/28/2021,299.0,I had a situation kind of like this about a decade ago. I got fired from a job (best thing to ever happen to me) and the sent me another paycheck after I left. They did something kind of funky where they paid current basically they were two weeks ahead I never really understood it. Anyway I did not expect to receive another paycheck from them but I did. When I got it I wasnt sure what to make of it due to their fuckery. I was contacted by them and they wanted me to pay the gross back to them I told them I would pay the net which was unacceptable. This was 100% their error. They paid payroll taxes which they wanted me to pay back. They paid insurance premiums which they be told me did not extend my coverage. The company I worked for was the insurance company that got paid the premiums. I basically told them to kick rocks and they told me it would go to collections. I never heard anything for three years and then I was called by a collection agency. I told them to send me a debt validation letter and I never heard from them again. My credit is perfect and nothing ever hit my score.   So yeah tell them to fuck off. Cut off my all contact. Unless you got it in a certified letter it never happened.
r3w7qb,hmdgl5f,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,3.0,Honestly you wouldn’t be surprised that this company would pull that move after reading their glassdoor reviews. Lesson learned more pay is not worth a bad company culture and ethics

r3w7qb,hmdgxrn,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,43.0,Yeah man we recently got married and got a home for 5% down so we only have like 10k in our bank left. If they ask for the full 56k or try to put a lean on our home then that would be terrible
r3w7qb,hmdjmrl,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,prplecat,11/28/2021,44.0,Texas is a one party consent state for recording conversations.  So you are entirely within your rights to record any phone calls with them.
r3w7qb,hmdiu51,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,70.0,Yeah the company has terrible PR. Lesson learned don’t join a bad company just because they pay more
r3w7qb,hmdg9rv,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,ADuckNamedPhil,11/28/2021,7.0,They seem to be bullying her from beyond the grave. It makes zero sense that she would have to return *all* of her salary/wages. That would mean she would have given them nine months of work for free.
r3w7qb,hmdcayg,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,206.0,No signing bonus either

r3w7qb,hmdf1q3,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,146.0,Yeah man no description or nothing. Just a memo via emailing saying to send 56k in funds to this company bank account and address. When we asked what is this for - no response since. Been 2 weeks.
r3w7qb,hmdewou,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,stayongo,11/28/2021,14.0,You should absolutely not reply to their request at all. In any way. And in the meantime consult with an employment lawyer to review her contract. Document all communication from them.
r3w7qb,hmdjzci,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,jcruzyall,11/28/2021,27.0,do not ignore -- do what you need to do to understand the basis of their claim... then decide what it means to you and plan the next step. Dont ignore it. Also dont volunteer any information to them and dont answer questions from them. Do not do their homework for them dont accidentally help them by trying to clear things up.
r3w7qb,hmdi6hw,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,JayceThompson101,11/28/2021,2.0,Thank you brother! Have a wonderful day!

r3w7qb,hmdgg4x,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,Throwaway123212349,11/28/2021,7.0,Did they pay to relocate you or pay for immigration work?  Those can also be subject to clawback in a separate section of the offer letter.  Most relocations are subject to clawback if you quit within a year.  We request gross repay if you are going to repay in the year subsequent to when you received relocation because you need to take a claim of right on your tax return for the withheld taxes that the company can no longer claim back directly.
r3w7qb,hmdfhrd,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,ThatITguy2015,11/28/2021,6.0,Thank you for reporting them. Too many do not and let shit companies get away with it.
r3w7qb,hmdhqj8,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,DogKnowsBest,11/28/2021,75.0,Im not an HR professional but Ive been in the corporate world working both tech and tech sales positions for 35 years. I know what a base salary is and it has absolutely zero to do with commission or a draw against commission.  What you might be referring to is called clawback a potential contract provision that is typically reserved for executive level employees who may leave the company and go to a competitor.  Individual state laws may exclude or limit the amount of take back an employer can take.  However for a clawback to be enforceable it MUST be in the employer/employee contract.  /u/JayceThompson101 has stated that reading through his wifes contract there was no such provision and thus the employer has no rights whatsoever to require the employee to payback monies earned.  And if this scenario holds true OPs wife is fully lawfully protected.
r3w7qb,hmdhal3,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,thepolishpen,11/28/2021,9.0,No.  No it’s not legal. Even if she signed something with that stipulation it would have to be something special to stand up in court.
r3w7qb,hmdkff0,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,softnmushy,11/28/2021,176.0,Ill add that if they are violating employment and wage laws those laws commonly will force the employer to pay your wifes attorney fees and a little bit of extra money.   So if you find the right lawyer your wife could make some money while teaching them a lesson.  Make sure you dont pay the attorney out of your pocket though. The right kind of attorney would not ask for that.
r3w7qb,hmdgsjh,Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?,itsallgonnafade,11/28/2021,-1355.0,Your wife should be asking for more information not you. It was her job. Why are you talking to these people so much?
r3ttns,hmddnnz,Furniture salesman bait and switch attempt?,uptimefordays,11/28/2021,2.0,> In reality he probably felt awkward having to come back to you about the wrong price after you were already sold and had to do it because he wasnt authorized to sell for lower than that list price the company set.  That checks out.
